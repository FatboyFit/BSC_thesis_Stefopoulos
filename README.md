## Thesis Abstract

With the most recent outbreak of the Israel/Hamas conflict after October 7, 2023, media coverage has been critical in shaping public perception. This study explores how four major newspapers—The New York Times, The Guardian, The Jerusalem Post, and Asharq Alawsat—differ in their framing of the conflict. Using a deductive framing approach, the research focuses on the humanitarian, official, and military frames to reveal significant differences in coverage among the newspapers.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Articles were collected from The New York Times, The Guardian, The Jerusalem Post, and Asharq Alawsat, spanning from October 7, 2023, to April 15, 2024.
2. **Preprocessing**: Texts were cleaned and tokenized, removing stop words and punctuation.
3. **Topic Modeling**: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was used to extract three main topics representing the frames: humanitarian, official, and military.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests were conducted to compare the mean topic distributions across the newspapers.

## Key Findings

- The Jerusalem Post significantly emphasizes the official frame while under-representing the humanitarian frame.
- The New York Times and The Guardian show balanced framing with a notable presence of the military frame.
- Asharq Alawsat, while expected to focus on the humanitarian frame, showed no significant difference in its use compared to Western newspapers.
