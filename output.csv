In its 75 years of existence, Israel and Israelis have gone through much.
They've experienced war and peace, hostages captured and hostages released, and wicked, wicked acts of terrorism. They've never experienced a week like this.
This was a week where, night after night, the nation sat glued to its television sets, watching to see if the day's planned tranche of hostages would indeed be released.
It was a week of watching, day after day, videos of daughters running into the arms of fathers, and mothers gently stroking the faces of sons not seen for more than 50 days.
Yet it was also a week of listening to grandparents' heartbreaking pleas that their grandchildren be on the next day's list of people to be let go, and grandchildren begging that their grandfathers be released or at least be provided with medication.
It was a week of reading about the cruel ordeals the hostages faced in Hamas captivity; a week of listening to soul-crushing interviews of children returning whose parents were murdered; a week wondering whether the war would resume tomorrow, once again sending the country's soldiers and reservists - sons and daughters, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters - back into harm's way.
Israelis have dealt in the past with emotional peaks and valleys, with the intermingling of joy and sorrow, with national highs and lows. However, little compares to the current situation, where, on a national level, the removal of the metaphorical Band-Aid is being done at an agonizingly slow pace.
It was a week with an ordeal that never ended.
The previous night's sorrow and joy were followed by yet another night of sorrow and joy, and another, and another. This week strained the nation's nerves and rocked its emotional equilibrium. This was an Israeli week without precedent.
It was also a week that featured many images that capture the essence of Israel: the cheering, flag-waving people lining the roads, night after night, near the Hatzerim Air Force Base to greet the vans carrying the hostages; the pictures of helicopter pilots showing kindness to young children who just emerged from a horrible ordeal.
One video image was particularly striking and captured Israeliness very well.
Rimon Kirsht, wearing pink pajamas and among the liberated hostages, emerged from a Hamas vehicle on Tuesday night.
She boldly stared with unwavering disdain into the eyes of a masked and heavily armed Hamas terrorist, and then cocked her head to one side in a gesture that said, ""You're not the boss of me.""
Then, with her arm wrapped over the arm of another freed hostage, Merav Tal, she walked with her head held high and with great dignity to a waiting Red Cross vehicle as a crowd of people jeered and booed.
Before getting into the car, she exchanged a few words of apparent dismissal with a worker of the International Red Cross, an organization whose inefficacy has been painfully evident during this whole ordeal.
Kirsht's actions swiftly catapulted her into social media stardom. Responding to footage of this brief encounter, one person remarked, ""The heroine of the day, the legendary Rimon Kirsht, stands up to the Hamas terrorist and confronts him with unvarnished truth. Then she did not spare the Red Cross representative justified criticism. Courageous, resourceful women are emblematic of Israel's growing strength these days. I could watch this in loops. [She is a] champion.""
TELLINGLY, DESPITE the week that strained the country's emotional resources, hardly a public voice was heard calling on the government to agree to a permanent ceasefire and stop the war now.
All over the world - in the streets and in the corridors of power - there were calls, many of them hateful and downright antisemitic, calling for an end to the fighting in Gaza. All over the world, there were demands for a permanent ceasefire.
But not in Israel.
Not among Israelis who will actually pay the price of not ending the war, since it is their sons and daughters who will be risking their lives in continuing to fight the war, and since it is their wives and husbands at home alone with children while their spouses are in the north or south fighting terrorists.
Israeli life has been turned entirely on its head by this war - the economy has been devastated, and families torn apart temporarily as husbands and fathers have been away from home now for two months. Yet there are no protests here to end the war, no significant calls - even from the most left-wing Zionist parties - to stop the fighting.
In Israel, along with the tremendous emotional upheaval, there remains robust and wall-to-wall support for the war. An Israel Democracy Institute poll last week found that more than 90% of Jewish Israelis support the following goals of the war: toppling Hamas, releasing all the hostages, and restoring deterrence.
There may be disagreement over whether the primary goal of the war should be incapacitating Hamas or facilitating the return of the hostages. There may be differences over whether these two objectives are complementary or contradictory. But there is strong agreement that since neither goal has been met, once the humanitarian truces designed for the hostage releases conclude, the war needs to be restarted.
The memory of the atrocities and horrors committed by Hamas on October 7 may be fading in the world, but not in Israel. Here, they remain raw and fresh and very much in the minds of soldiers and reservists, who, despite the hardships of the last two months for them and their families, remain - at least according to most accounts - fired up and motivated.
There was some concern that the truce and the release of the hostages day after day would temper the fury and anger felt by Israelis that have propelled the military thrust into Gaza. But there has been no evidence of this at all.
On the contrary, the way Hamas seems to be cruelly toying with the nation's emotions; the way it released Saturday night's tranche only two minutes before midnight; the way it says it cannot ""find"" some mothers and children; the way it is not releasing 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, his brother Ariel, four, or their parents, Shiri and Yarden, claiming they were killed in an Israeli airstrike, only increases the nation's anger and determination to destroy the terrorist organization.
As do the tales now filtering out telling of how Hamas mistreated hostages - mentally torturing them in some instances, beating them in others. This does not deaden the desire to fight the terrorist organization; instead, it increases it. As does, of course, the terrorist attack in Jerusalem on Thursday morning - yet another bloodthirsty case of terrorists murdering innocent civilians.
The nation's sentiment was summed up well on Wednesday afternoon by Haim Jelin, a Kibbutz Be'eri resident, former head of the Eshkol Regional Council, and former Yesh Atid Knesset member from 2015 to 2019 who then jumped to the Labor Party but failed to make it back into the Knesset on its list.
""Let's put everything on the table,"" he said in a KAN Reshet Bet interview. ""First, all of the hostages need to be brought home. All of them.""
Second, he said, ""the government must direct the IDF to eliminate terrorism. Without that, there will be no settling of the Negev. This is not a war for our region but for the character of the state: how Israel can eliminate terrorism in a manner that all our neighbors will understand and see. This is what we need to do, not be afraid. Will there be diplomatic pressure? Yes, there will be. But they humiliated all of Israel. Everyone, the whole state.""
Those words come not from someone on the Right, but from someone identified with the Center-Left. Those words come after two months of fighting inside Gaza and reflect the consensus opinion in this country that Israel is fighting a justified and unavoidable war that it absolutely must win.
As the war rages on, as pressure mounts from abroad, as ideas will be floated for Israel to stop the war if Hamas releases the remaining hostages or if its leaders agree to leave Gaza, cracks may appear in this consensus.
But that is in the future. Right now, even after an emotionally turbulent week the likes of which the country has never before experienced and amid full understanding of the human and material costs involved in continuing the war, the nation remains resolute.
In the early stages of the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu framed it in very stark terms: it is either Hamas or us. Few Israelis took issue with that portrayal at the time, and few Israelis would say - even after a week in which more than 100 hostages were released - that this characterization is no longer on the mark.

Resisting the ceasefire pressure that would keep Hamas standing

It is safe to say that no one in the Prime Minister's Office or the Foreign Ministry fell off their chairs when they heard the most recent comments by the prime ministers of Spain, Belgium, and Ireland regarding the Israel-Hamas war.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who held a bizarre press conference at Rafah with his Belgian counterpart Alexander De Croo minutes before the first 13 Israeli hostages were to be released on Friday, called for a permanent ceasefire and said that if the EU does not recognize a Palestinian state, Spain might do so unilaterally on its own.
In other words, some 3,000 Hamas terrorists invade Israel, murder, rape, burn, mutilate, and plunder, and their reward from Spain will be to be recognized as an independent state.
At that press conference before the hostage release, which the Spanish and Belgian leaders had no reason to call, because they had nothing to do with the negotiations that led to the deal, the Belgian prime minister also had his own vacuous pearls of wisdom.
""We cannot accept a society is destroyed the way the society of Gaza is being destroyed,"" he said, without stating clearly that it is Hamas that has been destroying Gaza. He then launched into some la-la-land-like rhetoric about ""One day people will need to talk to each other, and a political solution is the only solution that is possible.""
As if any kind of political agreement is possible if Hamas is still standing after this war.
And then there was Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who welcomed the return of dual Irish-Israeli citizen Emily Hand by posting on X that ""an innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned.""
In Varadker's telling, it is as if nine-year-old Emily went to a crowded beach with her family, got separated for a while from her parents, and was later returned by a benevolent lifeguard, not that she was barbarically ripped away from family and home and held as a hostage for 51 days by Hamas terrorists.
Why couldn't the Irish prime minister utter that awful truth? Because to do so would be to undermine the false narrative that his government and Irish governments and various Irish political parties have been peddling for years about defenseless Palestinians being oppressed by ruthless and heartless Israelis and ""settlers.""
So, why was no one surprised by these comments in Jerusalem? Because they were coming from the usual suspects. For decades now, these three countries, along with others such as Portugal, Malta, and Luxembourg, have led a blindly pro-Palestinian faction inside the EU.
Their recent comments prove the dictum: old habits die hard. But the EU itself is proof that sometimes old habits do die. For instance, looking back at the EU over the last 25 years, it is impossible not to see changes inside the EU when it comes to Israel.
If in the past, countries like Belgium, Ireland, and Spain used to easily get condemnations of Israel passed in EU forums, now it is more difficult as countries such as the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, and even Germany will block such moves. Which is why Sanchez said that if the EU does not recognize ""the state of Palestine"" - something that won't happen - Spain may do so unilaterally.
If Spain does unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state, it won't be the first EU country to do so. Sweden was the first to do so in October 2014, in a move that infuriated Israel and sent bilateral ties between the two countries into a tailspin.
Today, however, things have changed, and Sweden - once among Israel's greatest detractors inside the EU - is, as a result of a government change there that brought a right-wing government into power, now among Israel's supporters in the EU.
Change is possible - just look at Cyprus and Greece, who a couple of decades earlier had attitudes toward Israel similar to those of Ireland, Belgium, and Spain today, yet now are among Israels strong allies.
Attitudes in Spain and Belgium could change, though it is doubtful this will happen anytime soon. In the meantime, it will be interesting to watch and see whether other EU countries follow Spain and Belgium's lead and call now for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
If the current truce is extended to allow for further hostage releases, there will be intense public pressure in Europe to stop the war, as the destruction inside Gaza continues to flood European news channels. Israel quickly responded to the statements of the Irish, Belgian, and Spanish leaders, with both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Foreign Ministry decrying them, and the Foreign Ministry calling in the ambassadors of those countries to clarify those remarks.
Israel signaling its complete opposition to talk of a permanent ceasefire now is something the country will increasingly need to do if it hopes to continue the military offensive against Hamas.
With the cannons temporarily silent, this is the hour for a full-court Israeli diplomatic press in Europe to make it clear why Israel cannot agree to a ceasefire now, with Hamas still standing.
One of Israel's talking points in trying to secure Western legitimacy for continuing to wage its war against Hamas is to say that, if Israel does not knock out this ISIS-like terrorist organization, then its fanatical brand of Islamist jihad ideology will spread. Or, as Foreign Minister Deputy Director-General for Europe Daniel Meron said in a Kan bent interview on Sunday, ""the West is next.""
And he's right.
But there is also another strong argument for wiping out Hamas's military capabilities that will resonate now that many in the world are saying that the October 7 attack and the Hamas-Israel war show the need to find a political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: No political solution will ever be possible as long as Hamas and its sister terrorist organizations remain a factor in Palestinian society.
It just won't happen. They don't want peace with Israel, ever. And after October 7, it is a pipe dream to believe that Israel will be willing to make concessions to Hamas until it is eradicated as a military threat.

Evacuated Holocaust survivors struggle to get basic needs

Holocaust survivors who evacuated from the South and North due to Israel's ongoing war with Hamas are struggling to receive their basic needs, due to a lack of resources and available aid, a Knesset statement revealed Tuesday.
This comes as Yesh Atid MK Meirav Cohen, who heads the special committee to help address the needs of Holocaust survivor evacuees, visited the various hotels where evacuees are staying, with the intention of ensuring that survivors are ""receiving all the necessary services and that their needs are provided for [by] the government.""
After the October 7 massacre, Holocaust survivors have been overcome by fear and painful memories from their past. ""This reminds me of what we went through and how much we suffered,"" said Holocaust survivor Sarina Blumenfeld.
Holocaust survivor Clara, from the northern town of Shlomi, has been evacuated from her home and is currently staying at a government-funded hotel. Clara stated that she was received well at the hotel and felt comfortable there. However, she adds that ""they need to match the food better for people our age.""
Overall the Holocaust survivors are being taken care of, but ""there is still room for improvement,"" Cohen said. ""There is a need to put someone in charge from the government or else the mess will continue.""
Currently, all branches of the National Insurance Institute have been closed to the public since the beginning of the war. This has made it difficult to provide senior citizens with the government services they need.
Volunteers need to make up for the lack of government workers to help the survivors receive basic needs such as medication. Amit stated that ""everything relies on volunteers. They go with evacuees to pharmacies in the city to buy medicine.""
When volunteers go to pick up medication for the survivors, they experience further difficulty due to the lack of doctors. ""There is one doctor for all the evacuees here,"" Amit continued, adding that it creates long waiting times.
Another issue is a lack of Russian speakers, with only a few volunteers or National Insurance Institute representatives speaking the language. This has been a source of frustration among both the survivors and their family members.
Michal, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, has stated that her father's condition has deteriorated since his evacuation. She has been left with no choice but to abandon government support and turn to private help, paying thousands of shekels.
Tami Diskin from the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry expressed her frustration with the disorganization as well.
She emphasized the need for a community manager provided by the government.

Speaking at Dubai's COP28 Summit, US Vice President Kamala Harris said ""we cannot conflate Hamas with the Palestinian people."" ""We"" Israelis, Americans, Westerners, don't have to - the Palestinians and their thuggish enablers keep doing it by deifying Hamas.
Harris's comments sounded foolish to most Arabs' ears - they know the truth. For decades, the world has absolved Palestinians of responsibility for the violence they keep encouraging. This morally idiotic free pass continues, even as Palestinians worldwide cheer Hamas, even as we hear reports of doctors and UNWRA teachers holding innocent Israelis hostage, even as polls show that 75% of Palestinians support Hamas - especially the October 7 massacre, which Gazans facilitated. Just last week, Gazans threatened to lynch the hostages being freed - bizarrely, the Hamas war criminals protected the Israeli women and children from the mob.
That three-quarters of Palestinians champion the savagery reflects a broad Palestinian consensus. Only 36% of Americans approve of Harris, yet she represents them. Westerners proclaiming Palestinian ""innocence"" or warning that, by defending itself, Israel might alienate Palestinians ignore how Jew-killing thrills the Palestinian street. Note the absence of Palestinian resistance to Hamas, even in free countries.
Harris and her fellow Western dupes should learn Roni Krivoi's story - Israelis know it well.
The first male Israeli adult hostage freed, Krivoi is a 25-year-old Russian-Israeli soundman who staffed the Supernova music festival. That desecration of the love celebration is now Israel's worst single terrorist attack, murdering 364 civilians, wounding hundreds more, kidnapping 40. The terrorists' own Go-Pro cameras broadcast searing images of Palestinians raping, kidnapping, and killing.
Dragged to Gaza, Krivoi eventually escaped his captors amid the chaos following a bombing. But unlike in World War II movies, there were no ""good Germans"" to save him from these modern Nazis - a serious Palestinian resistance exists only in Western hallucinations. After four days, his aunt reported, ""the Gazans captured him and returned him to the terrorists' hands.""
Krivoi's recapture explains why, to many Israelis, it's not just about Hamas. Even before the polls proved it, Gazans shared videos of themselves celebrating the violence and following the terrorists into Israel to rape, pillage, and murder. Raided kibbutznikim recognized workers whom they had befriended participating enthusiastically, sometimes directing the evil. That's why Western leaders who pretend that only Hamas committed these war crimes sound naive to their Arab interlocutors in Dubai, let alone to Israelis.
THE BLIZZARD of lies denying Israeli suffering while forgiving Palestinians reflects an age-old phenomenon - the dehumanization of the Jews.
In the 1590s, William Shakespeare recognized that bigots first degrade individuals. ""If you prick us, do we not bleed?"" Shylock the Jew in The Merchant of Venice famously asked. ""If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?""
Today, Israelis - and Jews - feel that same erasure of pain, that denial of humanity, and that self-righteous fury against us for daring to defend ourselves. Today, many Jewish women wonder: ""If you deny you raped us, do we not suffer?""
It's dehumanizing when academics blame Israelis for being slaughtered; when Palestinians call for genocide, yet Israelis get called ""genocidal""; when #MeToo feminists suddenly turn silent about modern history's greatest act of self-promoted gendered violence; when ""Queers for Palestine"" overlook Hamas homophobia; when liberals support dictatorial, homicidal terrorists and their cheerleaders.
It's dehumanizing when reporters equate stolen Israeli civilians with convicted Palestinian terrorists as ""captives""; when reporters describe the next ""tranche"" of hostages, treating bound humans like financial bonds; when Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar describes Hamas's cynical release of a nine-year-old Irish-Israeli girl, Emily Hand, as ""An innocent child who was lost has now been found and returned.""
Obfuscating evil and the evildoers intensifies the offense - and Israel's outrage.
Similarly, it's dehumanizing to deny the widespread Palestinian Jew-hatred, or to restrain Israel's army in ways American generals wouldn't tolerate. The campuses were calm in 2017 when America helped liberate Mosul from ISIS, despite killing 10,000-plus innocent, nonhostile civilians as ""collateral damage."" And the firepower America and the Allies unleashed against civilians to defeat Nazi Germany and fascist Japan in World War II shows how surgical Israel's assault is.
Calls for an Israeli ""ceasefire"" lack credibility, after international pressure imposed ""ceasefires"" in 2009, 2012, 2014, 2019, and 2021 - whenever Israel defended itself before.
""Remember, there was a ceasefire on October 6, that Hamas broke by their barbaric assault on peaceful civilians,"" former secretary of state Hillary Clinton explained on The View. Clinton added: ""Hamas have consistently broken ceasefires...,"" while affirming: ""Israel has a right to defend itself, as does Ukraine.""
Such moral clarity doesn't prevent Israelis from mourning the deaths of Palestinian children and any innocents caught in the crossfire. It just emphasizes that Hamas started the war and must reap the consequences, while the Palestinians' failure to pressure Hamas to free the hostages and leave Gaza only extends their own suffering. Israel tries minimizing civilian deaths, but its primary responsibility is to protect its citizens, then Western civilization.
US President Joe Biden spoke authoritatively in October - and should say it again. Hamas must be removed. Most Palestinians, in Gaza and abroad, support Hamas's evil. Biden's moral cry reflects just war theory. It's the only realistic way of ending today's humanitarian crisis in Gaza, while allowing Roni Krivoi and thousands of other Israeli survivors a shot at sleeping soundly at night, as they did before October 7.
The writer is an American presidential historian and, most recently, the editor of a three-volume set, Theodor Herzl: Zionist Writings, the inaugural publication of The Library of the Jewish People.

Since the first aliyah in the late 1800s, Israel has changed from an exclusive socialist, secular, Jewish agrarian culture to something much more. In its very small geographic footprint, Israel is now a leading country in many categories (hi-tech, medicine, and, of course, agriculture, to name a few).
Israel has also become multicultural on many levels. This tiny country has opened its arms to Jewish refugees from all over the world, who in turn bring their ethnicities, culture, religious interpretations, music, and art.
As a theocratic democracy, Israel is both a Jewish state and democratic, where citizens of any religion, race, or ethnicity can experience freedom - much like many other Western democracies.
A core concept, expressed in Israel's Declaration of Independence, is ""The State of Israel... will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace ...; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions...""
And this was accomplished without loss of Jewish identity. Preceding the above paragraph, the Declaration states: ""Accordingly, we, representatives of the Jewish community, hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish State... to be known as the State of Israel.""
The national anthem of the State of Israel, ""Hatikvah"" (The Hope), is a two-stanza song whose words speak of the historic yearning of Jews for a return to their ancient national home in the Land of Israel, where they would live as a ""free"" people.
Hatikvah originated in the Zionist Movement. It was written by poet Naftali Herz Imber circa 1878 and published in Jerusalem in 1886. The music was then composed by Samuel Cohen, who based the melody on a Romanian folk song.
The traditional lyrics, however, were rewritten to reflect the new historic reality of statehood. The last three lines of the original text spoke of ""the ancient hope to return to the land of our fathers, to the city where [King] David dwelt."" The revised version replaces the biblical allusion with an emphasis on ""the hope of two millennia to be a free people in our land, the land of Zion and Jerusalem.""
Is it time to re-write those lyrics today? I would not have thought so, but my granddaughter, who is active in a hasbara (public diplomacy)-based outreach program, has convinced me otherwise.
Since the start of the current Hamas-Israel war, I have been posting to my limited social media world examples of non-Jewish citizens of Israel who immediately jumped in to serve their country and help their fellow citizens. These include, for example, an Arab-Muslim volunteer for the ZAKA rescue service in Sderot, Bedouin Arabs of the Hatzalah (EMT) squad in Rahat, the Bedouin IDF unit, and ordinary Arab citizens immediately risking their own lives to save their fellow Israeli citizens at Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7 and continuing to help as the war goes on. They and their families are part of the tragic group who lost loved ones in what was an indiscriminate barbaric attack.
MY MOTIVATION for posting this common theme on social media was to show that regardless of how one hyphenates his or her identity (Israeli-Arab, -Muslim, -Christian, etc.), any loyal, productive citizen can thrive and be part of Israeli society without losing his or her ethnic, or religious identity.
This is as far as my thinking went until my granddaughter pointed out that several non-Jewish Israelis she has met through her outreach program do not sing the words nefesh Yehudi (Jewish soul) in the national anthem. (This is very different from those Arab students or MKs who demonstrate disloyalty by not singing or standing for the national anthem.)
Arabs and other non-Jewish citizens of Israel have long served in the army, police forces, and government, and have contributed to the economy and community in medicine, business, and agriculture.
And unlike the Arab riots of May 2021 in Israeli cities caused by incitement put forth by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, this current war is different. Israel's diverse Arab community, for the most part, has proven that they are just like all loyal citizens of Israel, proudly supporting their country's right to exist.
Therefore, as has been done before, it is time to consider officially either changing one word in the National anthem or allowing two official versions to be sung - ""nefesh Yehudi"" or ""nefesh Yisraeli"" according to one's personal preference.
""Yisraeli"" (Israeli) is consistent with the Jewish identity of the State of Israel (language, calendar, symbology) and its Declaration of Independence (""the establishment of a Jewish State"").
This would make our claim of ""Am Echad"" - ""One People"" even stronger.

Body


In one of the most jarring videos that have emerged from the current war, the 22-year-old German-Israeli Shani Louk is seen partially naked as she is paraded in the streets of Gaza City by Hamas terrorists in the back of a pickup truck. Her long, black tresses are covered in blood from a significant head injury she sustained, presumably while trying to flee from her captors who raided the Supernova music festival she had participated in on the fateful, dark morning of October 7.
In the video, Gazans can be seen running after the truck in cheers, repeating the ""Allahu akbar"" cries chanted by the terrorists; they surround the vehicle, and then some of them spit on Louk's body.
Only on October 30 were the Israeli and German governments able to confirm Louk's death, relying on the fact that a temporal bone from her skull was found at the Supernova festival site with her DNA. A dislodgement of this bone is indicative of death, as no person can live without it. The rest of Louk's body has never been recovered.
Louk's tragic death, which involved the humiliating parade that was recorded in the video spread by the terrorists, is unfortunately only one of numerous testimonies that indicate that, aside from the murder and kidnapping of civilians and soldiers, Hamas had made the rape, assault, violation, and humiliation of women a prime goal in its attack on Israel last month.
While thousands of pieces of evidence have been collected by Israeli authorities, including personal testimonies and a document proving that Hamas terrorists were trained and taught to order women to take their pants off in Hebrew, there are those abroad who have denied this phenomenon. Denial is not the only harrowing response to what emerges as a systematic plan by Hamas to sexually attack Israeli women. Even louder than the denial is the deafening silence of leading women's movements and human rights organizations, such as the group UN Women - the UN's entity working for gender equality and the empowerment of women.
On Wednesday, the UN's ongoing silence in the face of such methodical violence against women was called to question by Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nation Gilad Erdan. Speaking at a UN Security Council meeting, Erdan hoisted up a picture of the 19-year-old Naama Levy, a soldier who had been kidnapped to Gaza. The photo shows Levy getting dragged out of a jeep by Hamas terrorists; her back is turned to the camera, revealing a large bloodstain that covers her backside and spreads down her legs, soaking her pants.
A project of historical significance
Following the UN meeting, Channel 12's US correspondent Yuna Leibzon reported that UN representatives have finally held their first meeting with members of the Civil Commission on October 7 Crimes by Hamas Against Women, founded by the Hebrew University's Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy.
For the past 25 years Prof. Yifat Bitton, a member of the commission, a legal expert and the president of Achva Academic College, has been researching violence against women and turning sexual assaults and murders into lawsuits to compensate victims.
""What's important in our project of gathering evidence is not only for us to be able to prove that it happened, although of course that matters, too,"" she explains in conversation with The Jerusalem Post. ""If the only way to prove that sexual assault took place is the existence of a video portraying rape, we would be forced to close 98% of the rape cases in the world. What I mean by this is that, of course, it's important that we gather evidence from a legal perspective, but our project also has international historical significance because the atrocities and crimes against humanity carried out by Hamas are so horrific.
""When rape is used in warfare as a tactic, as it has been by Hamas, the victims are often killed,"" says Bitton, adding that this was the case in many of the instances in which Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli women. Nonetheless, she is able to confirm that there are women who were sexually assaulted by Hamas terrorists and lived to tell the tale. Bitton and her colleagues usually refer survivors to official organizations like the police. ""Since we have not been trained to collect testimonies of sexual assault victims, this is the police's responsibility. However, it depends on the will of the complainants. Some reach out to us to testify that this happened to them, but they don't want to then go through a full interrogation by the police.""
Bitton explains that she and her colleagues are assisting the country in gathering evidence because the state has no prior experience in handling a case of this magnitude and scope, and under such unusual circumstances. ""First of all, there is a limit to the amount of what we call in legal terms first-rate evidence. Most of the sites in which the assaults took place were combat zones later handled by emergency forces, and as such they were not treated as crime scenes, and no one took into account that forensic evidence has to be collected, or that these scenes are being contaminated.""
The lack of first-rate evidence means that there are second-rate testimonies that the authorities should be looking out for, Bitton stresses. ""There were survivors of the [Supernova music] festival who hid from the attackers and witnessed assault. There are soldiers who fought in the communities that came under attack and witnessed assault. No one usually thinks of soldiers as witnesses, and it also hardly makes sense to interrogate them while they are fighting, but in this case it has to be done in the near future.""
An important factor that has to be weighed when the state does interrogate these witnesses, Bitton adds, is that the questioning be done in an efficient way. ""These are people who suffered intense trauma, be they civilians or soldiers, and we have to make sure they are interrogated with awareness and sensitivity. Another aspect is that there are various entities conducting investigations at the moment, and we have to make sure that we don't make traumatized people repeat their stories and go through interrogations more than once.""
As she offers her expertise and advice to the various official organizations racking up the evidence, Bitton expresses the hope that they will all unite under one investigative body or committee. ""This would be the most logical route, and that's what the prime minister should be aiming for and making a top priority in his handling of the war.""
In the meantime, she expresses cautious optimism. ""I already see the positive effect of what we're doing. We don't stop. We write, we hold meetings, we make countless telephone calls, and this has an impact. Even in the coverage of the war, there is now a special focus shed on the crimes committed against women - and that tells you a lot. There is constant progress, even outwardly, not just in Israel. Organizations are listening to us and responding to our calls.""
Waging the battle of words
The battle to raise public awareness of the awful crimes committed by Hamas terrorists against Israeli women is also being fought on another front - that of words.
One woman who claimed a significant role in the campaign to influence and shape public policy last week is Israeli journalist Rotem Izak, who has been covering cultural affairs as well as welfare and women's issues for a variety of Hebrew-language outlets for many years.
Most recently, Izak rose to prominence due to her popular column for Yediot Aharonot, in which she writes candid and impassioned texts about themes that many policy-makers opt to ignore - from cultural misrepresentation to noninclusive legislation to femicide.
Izak turned to her weapon, the pen, to write what many Israeli and Jewish women have been thinking over the past seven weeks of war. Her poignant text, which was posted online, circulated among thousands, who requested that it be translated into English so it could be shared worldwide, which the journalist did.
""The silence of women's organizations worldwide regarding October 7 is political, and that's why it is so outrageous and painful,"" Izak writes. ""Moreover, it is embarrassing. It shames feminism, academia, and the entire Western world because... when progressive organizations choose to turn women's erasure into an act that needs to be examined in a broader political context, the message is that still, despite everything, not all women are equal.""
Speaking to the Post via telephone this week, Izak says that she was moved to write her latest column because she felt betrayed by leading theorists such as US philosopher and gender studies scholar Judith Butler, who has yet to express any solidarity with Israeli women or condemn the attacks on them in any remark since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war last month.
""I grew up reading the essays of Judith Butler, I learned her work at university when I studied gender studies, and now I see her ignoring what happened to her people and specifically to women. She is such a feminist who paved the path for women like me, and she is well aware of the additional and heavy price women pay in wars; yet she chooses to ignore it,"" Izak explains. ""Her silence and her choice not to acknowledge a complex narrative, to only acknowledge the Palestinian side of the narrative, made me feel abandoned as a woman and as a feminist.
""I think that what's happening now in the world should be interpreted by us - feminists in Israel and worldwide - as an invitation to reexamine ourselves and our agenda,"" Izak continues. ""Do we really practice what we preach? I, for one, constantly check my moral standards. Which is why it's important for me to say that I am devastated for the innocent women and children suffering in Gaza because of Hamas.""
Asked why the silence of human rights organizations made her so indignant, Izak replies that ""this should be something we take for granted. I expected women's organizations to be the first entities to remind the public how this [the sexual assault and rape of Israeli women in the October 7 attacks] is yet another form of terrorism. I felt that with their silence, these organizations are making out Jewish and Israeli women to be fair targets, not just here but in the world over.""
Izak wishes to remind readers that the violence directed at women in this war is not a new phenomenon. ""We don't have to look at the Jewish-Palestinian conflict to know that rape is a form of punishment utilized in warfare; this is a known historical fact,"" she says. ""Raping women is a warfare tactic meant to punish the victims' communities and countries, and this applies to what happened to the women who were assaulted on October 7.""
'Truly evil things took place'
Responding to requests that have emerged on traditional and social media that Israel present proof of its allegations that Hamas raped Israeli women, Izak charges: ""Are the morals of the #MeToo movement not valid in this case? Why are they suddenly asking for context? There is ample proof [of the rapes]: There are photographs, videos, and testimonies. Nonetheless, why are they asking for proof to begin with? Don't we live in a post-MeToo culture where women tell each other 'I believe you' as a basic working assumption?""
American-Israeli journalist Lahav Harkov, formerly a diplomatic correspondent for the Post and currently a senior political correspondent for The Jewish Insider, seems to concur with Izak. In a report published this week, Harkov gathered multiple pieces of evidence of the assault on women, speaking to both official sources and to witnesses.
""The fact that these groups [global women's rights organizations] are ignoring it is shameful, and it speaks to the fact that there are values that seem more important to them than protecting women and believing women. They need to seriously examine their bias,"" Harkov says.
In her article, Harkov quotes S., a woman who survived the Supernova music festival massacre and provided a testimony to the Israel Police that Harkov was able to view. ""They bent a woman over and I understand he's raping her, and then passing her to someone else,"" S. is quoted as having recounted. ""He sliced off her breast and played with it. Someone really penetrated her, and shot her in the head.""
Witnessing some of the testimonies, Harkov shares, ""was terrible. It was chilling; these are things no person could ever imagine. I was appalled. Truly evil things took place there.""
In her report, Harkov explains that the mere task of gathering evidence was challenging because most of the areas in which the assaults took place were active sites of terrorism, and full access to the communities in the South that came under attack was entirely gained by security forces only 48 hours after the massacre had started.
The main mission of the authorities, Harkov points out in her report, was to collect and identify the bodies - meaning that in many cases crime scene investigation protocols couldn't be enacted, and rape kits were not administered, because DNA evidence can only be used within 48 hours of an attack.
""I know that some other local reports are taking the angle of blaming the police and asking how they did not handle this issue. I think that we're in an unprecedented event, a mass casualty the like of which Israel has never seen. Evidence couldn't be gathered right away, because it was an active combat zone,"" she points out. ""Another point is that forces didn't know what they needed to be looking for, and ZAKA [volunteers] aren't forensic scientists,"" Harkov adds in reference to the voluntary emergency search and rescue organization that was the first to arrive at the scenes of the massacre on October 7 after military forces, and has been tasked with cleaning out the sites, identifying bodies, and bringing them to burial. ""There certainly was chaos, but I actually do think that this issue is being taken seriously by the authorities. It's just going to take some time.""
The Post reached out to ZAKA to inquire whether volunteers at the sites of the massacre witnessed signs of sexual assault on deceased bodies of victims; one ZAKA spokesman confirmed this was the case but refused to elaborate. Responding to the question whether ZAKA collaborated with the Israel Police to check for evidence of rape and whether ZAKA volunteers are currently providing the police with testimonies concerning the sexual assault and rape of victims, ZAKA released the following official response:
""From the very outbreak of the war, hundreds of ZAKA volunteers have acted at various sites, in Gaza border communities and on the nearby roads, to gather and handle the bodies of more than 1,000 people who were murdered. They have collected bodies from homes, treated the dead with respect, and did holy work in a race against the clock in order to bring the deceased to proper burial in Israel.
""Our actions were carried out primarily in collaboration with special military forces. The areas on the Gaza border were defined as warded-off military zones due to the life risk imposed on those working in them and due to their proximity to the Gaza border and to territories in which active fighting was taking place. In some of the scenes, we acted in collaboration with police teams.
""Due to the difficult nature of the events and out of respect for the victims, we will not provide specific details. ZAKA volunteers who have handled the difficult scenes have testified in recent weeks to police officers, detailing the horrors and cruelty they had been exposed to during their work. ZAKA volunteers have witnessed extremely difficult cases.""

Support for Israel eroding at its base

Israel is in danger of losing its longest-lasting and most reliable bastion of support, the Democratic Party. The Israel-Hamas war is the latest in a growing list of stress points that mark the tenure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. There is nothing sudden nor surprising about the erosion among Democrats and Jewish voters, who traditionally give the party about three-quarters of their votes.
The brutal October 7 pogrom by Hamas, which left more than 1,200 dead, thousands wounded, and some 240 taken hostage, brought a wave of sympathy for Israel. None more than from the US president, who immediately expressed his full support for Israel, ordered an emergency military resupply, dispatched two carrier task forces to the region, and flew to Tel Aviv to offer his sympathy and support. No other American president has ever done that.
Also, an estimated 300,000 people showed up in Washington last week to demonstrate their support for Israel, but by then the cracks were already appearing. Many were demanding total destruction of Hamas, others focused on the return of the hostages, and some called for a ceasefire and peace negotiations.
Israel may have been winning the war on the battlefield, but it was losing in the media, which was saturated with dramatic pictures of Israel's devastating bombing campaign and the ""collateral damage,"" a growing Palestinian civilian casualty toll, particularly among children. The firsthand reports from Gaza initially came only from Hamas and its sympathizers, but that didn't seem to temper the outrage.
Biden's unprecedented support brought high praise in Israel and among most Jewish voters. But it didn't quell criticism from many Democrats, particularly progressives.
An NBC News poll showed Biden's support within his party has been harmed by his unwavering support for Israel's handling of the Gaza war. As many as 70% of Democratic voters say they're unhappy with his handling of the war, The Jerusalem Post reported. That breaks down along generational lines, with those under 35 showing increased sympathy for the Palestinian side, while those over 65 continue strong backing for Israel. Other polls show similar results.
This comes at a bad time for Biden, as early presidential polls show him trailing his likely Republican opponent but, more critically, bleeding support among Democratic voters. Some, particularly among Arab-American and Muslim voters, may defect to the Republicans. But those on the Left are more likely just to stay home on Election Day, which would have the same impact.
THIS EROSION among Democrats accelerated with the Gaza war filling television screens, social media, and newspapers around the clock, but it has been going on for several years, most notably in the Netanyahu era.
Netanyahu's opposition to the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Clinton-era peace initiatives strained relations with Washington from the outset. At one point, he intentionally snubbed president Bill Clinton by breaking protocol to speak to a group of evangelical Christians before going to the White House.
The prime minister, who once boasted to an interviewer ""I speak Republican,"" teamed up with the opposition to lead the GOP lobbying effort against president Barack Obama's Iran nuclear agreement. Bilateral relations were deeply damaged.
Under pressure from Obama, he endorsed the two-state approach to peace with the Palestinians with multiple caveats, but then beat a hasty retreat. Today he is an outspoken opponent of that policy. In 2023, that means rejecting Biden's calls for putting the two-state option on the table as part of any negotiation to end the Palestinian conflict. Bibi has left no doubt he prefers a form of the Bantustan approach of apartheid South Africa that kept the black population powerless in their own ""homelands.""
The rejection of Palestinian sovereignty is seen by many as forcing Israel to decide whether to be a Jewish state or a democracy. It can't be both with five million disenfranchised Palestinians and another 2 million Israeli Arabs within the borders of a Greater Israel alongside 7 million Jews.
That one-state solution is being pushed by Netanyahu's extremist coalition partners, who make no secret of their desire to drive out as many Palestinians as possible and to - for the Jewish supremacists in his government - replace the current democracy with a theocracy.
Netanyahu has made it clear that he ranks evangelical Christian support above that of American Jews, who are far less numerous and more questioning. He's called Christian supporters Israel's best friends in the world. They are the largest voting bloc in the GOP, more in line with right-wing Israeli policies than the Jews, more supportive of settlement expansion on the West Bank, and more likely to oppose Palestinian sovereignty because it might delay their end-of-days prophecies, none of which end well for the world's Jews.
Netanyahu's active support for the proliferation of West Bank settlement, an intentional obstacle to Palestinian statehood, has long caused friction with most American presidents, and particularly among Democrats as well as with many Jewish supporters.
More recently the wave of settler violence against Palestinians on the West Bank threatens to provoke another intifada, yet Netanyahu does little to stop it. His coalition partners often instigate and justify the violence. Bibi is more scared of them than his critics, because they have the power to bring down his government, undermining his effort to stay out of prison (he is currently on trial for fraud, bribery, and corruption).
IF THAT were all, dayenu. It would be enough to explain the fracture in Democratic and Jewish support for Israel under the leadership of its longest-serving prime minister. But there's more, and it's accelerating the schism.
It began earlier this year with his move to end the independence of Israel's Supreme Court and judiciary. He's calling it reform, but it is really an anti-democratic coup furthering his autocratic ambitions.
Then came Hamas. Many observers in Israel believe that Netanyahu's policies of focusing on the West Bank and settlements led to a blind eye toward Gaza, where it was assumed Hamas would quietly focus on governing and not war.
There have been calls from the Left by Senator Bernie Sanders and House ""Squad"" progressives, for Congress to condition or even withhold military aid to Israel. So far, they've been a fringe minority. But their concerns are spreading to the mainstream. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency reports ""a growing shift in how Jewish Democrats"" approach the war.
Axios estimates more than three dozen members of Congress are calling for a ceasefire. These include several Jewish Democrats such as Representatives Jamie Raskin, Sara Jacobs, Becca Balint, and Dean Phillips (who is running against Biden for the presidential nomination), and Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia. More are calling for a humanitarian pause.
One Democratic lawmaker, Palestinian-American Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, has been a strident critic - that may be an understatement - of Israel. Her embrace of the genocidal Palestinian theme, ""from the river to the sea,"" which is considered a call to destroy the State of Israel and its Jewish inhabitants, led to her censure. Only 22 Democrats voted against her.
The brutality on both sides is driving an unprecedented wave of Islamophobia and antisemitism across the country. It is being fed by social media, including X (formerly Twitter) whose owner, Elon Musk, last week endorsed an antisemitic tweet with ""You have said the actual truth.""
GOP support for Israel is less complex. Just keep the evangelicals happy, ignore the Palestinians, and force the Democrats and Biden to look bad by forcing votes on divisive far-right issues like settlements and Palestinians.
When the Senate returns next week from one of its frequent recesses, it will have on its plate a House-passed $14.3 billion military aid package for Israel. It has a Republican poison pill - pay for it from funding from the Internal Revenue Service budget - that must be removed. It will give senators a chance to show where they stand.
Reversing the erosion of Democratic support - and support among American Jews - will require a new leadership in Israel that can convince Americans - who are supplying critical political, diplomatic, and economic resources - that they are heard, and that the new government is serious about making peace.
That's not an intrusion on Israeli sovereignty. It is what bonds friendship. It is what cements the longstanding friendship between the two nations.

Israel's claims proven

For years, Israel has said that Hamas conducts its ongoing campaign of terrorism against Israel from within civilian sites in Gaza: homes, businesses, schools, refugee facilities... and hospitals.
And for years it had always been dismissed by the international community as paranoia or disinformation, or met with shrugs from those who agreed but had no idea what to do about it.
The massacre by Hamas that forced Israel to declare war against the terrorist government of Gaza was launched with the declaration that Israel, once and for all, was going to do something about it.
The evidence that Israel had been correct all along about Hamas's nefarious mode of operation began to pile up soon after the IDF began its offensive.
Early last week, IDF Spokesman R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari revealed an underground Hamas command center under Gaza's Rantisi Hospital that contained not only suicide vests, rocket propelled grenades and a variety of weapons, but also signs, such as baby bottles, that Hamas had held Israeli hostages there.
Hagari said there was both evidence and independent intelligence information that Hamas terrorists had returned directly to the hospital after committing the atrocities of October 7. He also noted that an IDF robot found additional terror tunnels, which were powered by electricity being siphoned off from the hospital for use by the terrorists underground.
That prompted US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to tell CNN, ""You can see even from open source reporting that Hamas does use hospitals, along with a lot of other civilian facilities, for command-and-control, for storing weapons, for housing its fighters. Without getting into this specific hospital or that specific claim, this is Hamas's track record.""
Later in the week, the IDF took control of Shifa Hospital, long asserted to be the location of a Hamas headquarters. On Wednesday, the military brought The Jerusalem Post and other selected media outlets to view Hamas's terror infrastructure up close, including its several-hundred-meter-long tunnel network.
The Post's Yonah Jeremy Bob reported on his visit that next to the Qatar facility within the Shifa complex was a vast amount not only of Hamas guns and grenades - which the IDF found hidden throughout the hospital - but also rocket-propelled grenade launchers, large and small advanced drones for delivering explosives, and a variety of sophisticated intelligence platforms.
The vastness of the tunnels themselves, illustrated by the variety of sophisticated rooms and the blast door the IDF had displayed earlier last week, was testimony to how important this location was to Hamas.
Adding to this irrefutable evidence that Shifa was being used as a terror base, the IDF last week also released information and video footage showing that the genocidal terrorist group brought some of the hostages it kidnapped in Israel to Shifa.
The footage shows terrorists inside the hospital on the morning of October 7 forcibly transporting a Nepalese and a Thai civilian, both kidnapped from Israeli territory.
In a statement on Thursday, the IDF said that Hamas ""used the hospital as a refuge for its terrorist forces and even brought Israeli hostages there who were kidnapped during the day of slaughter.""
The IDF and the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) announced on Thursday that they had arrested Dr. Muhammad Abu Salamiyah, the director of Shifa. According to a statement, he was being interrogated by the Shin Bet after significant testimony and video evidence that the hospital had been used as a command center for Hamas during his tenure.
There were reports on Thursday night that Hamas was demanding that the IDF withdraw from Shifa as part of the hostage deal, a demand that Israel rightly rejected.
The longer Israel stays in Gaza, the more it is discovering about Hamas's web of evil and its cynical use of civilians, especially the infirm, to provide a cover for their murderous actions. The world should be coming together to back Israel's actions and encourage it to continue its efforts to uproot the terror that has held Gaza captive for close to two decades.

Can Israel win the war and lose the peace?

The Netanyahu government blundered into the Gaza war as a result of a failure to grasp Hamas's intentions and capabilities, an excessive reliance on technology over human sources, an extremist political agenda, a heavy dose of hubris, and some ugly sexism.
One result is that even the unprecedented support of the Biden administration at the outset of the war is showing cracks as the extremist government in Jerusalem shows no signs of a plan to end the conflict or prepare for what comes next in a devastated Gaza.
Two prominent former leaders of the nation's security establishment, Ami Ayalon and Ephraim Halevy, offered a sharp critique of the government's handling of the crisis in a conversation sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Hamas was more closely watching what was going on in Israel than the IDF was watching Gaza, they said. The terror group saw a deeply divided nation in the midst of a constitutional crisis, and a government focused on annexing the West Bank while thinking Hamas didn't want war.
Israel ""depended too much on technology at the expense of human intelligence and paid a very heavy price,"" said Halevy, the former director of the Mossad intelligence agency and former director of Israel's National Security Council.
""Hamas saw what was going on and saw that this was its opportunity, and decided to take action, almost to perfection,"" he said. It watched as Israel moved most of its troops from the South to focus on the West Bank and the northern border with Lebanon.
The IDF and Israel's political leadership ""shrugged off"" warnings coming from the Border Defense Corps watching the Gaza border, not just because the government was confident Hamas didn't want war, but because the warnings were coming from women.
""We had all the facts,"" but ignored them, said Ayalon, the former head of the Shin Bet, Israel's FBI, and former commander in chief of the Israel Navy. ""The women who were responsible for observing knew everything, saw everything, described exactly the whole scenario, but we didn't understand it"" because it was against the mindset of the leadership.
Not only was their information rejected but ""they were threatened with court martial"" for challenging the top brass's judgment, Halevy said. ""One unit was transferred from the South to the West Bank because the extreme right-wing parties in the government wanted to annex the West Bank"" and wanted the army's resources sent there. ""So, when Hamas attacked almost no one was there to stop them,"" he said.
Except the women. More than 20 spotters were killed, abused, or taken hostage on October 7.
Netanyahu was preoccupied with the West Bank and ""put our assets"" there and in the North to watch Hezbollah, and ""our front with Gaza was empty"" the former security chiefs said.
""All Shin Bet directors thought that was a wrong policy"" and told the prime minister that personally, Ayalon said. They were convinced Hamas would never be a partner for peace because it is ""an ideology and they cannot give up their ideology.""
Netanyahu rejected their advice, with horrific consequences. It was his policy to keep Hamas and the Palestinian Authority divided so he could tell the world there was no one to talk to, Ayalon said. Israel's government ""had to make sure Hamas would continue to control Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority control the West Bank,"" and they would fight each other, he said.
Hamas ""became the only group in the eyes of the Palestinians to work against the Israeli occupation and for Palestinian freedom,"" he added. The Palestinian Authority was perceived on the Arab street as ""collaborators because they refused to use violence and were weak,"" corrupt, and cooperating with Israel against violence.
NOW, WELL into the third month of combat, it is too early to tell how or when it will end. Israel still lacks a realistic plan for the day after.
Israel thought it could make peace with the moderate Arabs like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and others and bypass the Palestinians, since the leaders of those countries had largely grown weary of Palestinian unwillingness to make the necessary compromises for a peace deal.
Hamas blew that theory up on October 7.
""The prime minister and the government have not made clear what our aim is at the end of the war. He said our goal is to destroy Hamas and we will chase them all over the world to kill them,"" Halevy said. ""The Israeli people deserve to know what the end game of this operation is. I suspect the prime minister himself doesn't know. We need to restore the confidence of the Israeli public. That is not happening.""
Ayalon added, ""You cannot send youngsters to war without defining the end goal; victory is not measured in military terms."" What do you want after the shooting stops?
Both intelligence chiefs support the two-state solution, something Netanyahu and his government adamantly oppose. ""It is realistic and the global players (America, Russia, China, Europe) all agree and understand this,"" Ayalon said. It is the only way for Israel to be safer and a Jewish democratic state.""
President Joe Biden agrees. The Israeli government ""does not want a two-state solution"" and its ""indiscriminate"" bombing of Gaza and high civilian casualty toll are among the reasons Israel is ""starting to lose"" the support of international public opinion, he said at a White House Hanukkah celebration this week.
He called on the prime minister to ""strengthen and change"" his current governing coalition in the hope it would make Netanyahu more flexible. But that won't make any difference. The problem starts at the top.
You don't have to be the director of the Mossad, the head of the Shin Bet, or the president of the United States to know Bibi is the problem, not the solution.

It is very distressing to be living in a world where we have endless proof of Hamas's war crimes and actions, yet people still find ways to question and doubt the legitimacy of Israel's response to defend itself and fight a terror group.
The IDF has provided endless evidence of Hamas embedding itself in hospitals and using them as military bases and weapons storage facilities, and still, the BBC airs a segment that attempts to cast doubt on the proof, instead of expressing outrage over the weapons that its correspondents found in a Gaza hospital.
Anyone paying attention to the news surrounding the Hamas-Israel war has been hearing a lot about Shifa Hospital.
Dar al-Shifa, meaning ""house of healing"" in Arabic, is one of Gaza's most prominent and best hospitals, situated in the northern Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. The site was a British Army barracks where in 1946 the British, governors of the area known as Mandatory Palestine, built a quarantine center for those suffering from febrile diseases. After the 1948 War of Independence (in which the combined armies of Egypt, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq attacked the newly established State of Israel) Egypt administered the Gaza Strip and turned it into a proper hospital. After the 1967 Israeli victory in the Six Day War (in which, on intelligence from Israeli spy Eli Cohen in Syria, Israel preempted the Egyptian airforce waiting to strike - and in which Egypt was joined by Jordan and Syria) Israel expanded and reconstructed the hospital in the 1980s as part of a coexistence project.
After Hamas took over the Gaza Strip, things changed.
As cited by Human Rights Watch, during the Fatah-Hamas conflict in June 2007, Fatah and Hamas clashed at the hospital, killing members of each other's organizations. Some injured people brought to the hospital were killed by Hamas terrorists once they were inside. A report from the British Medical Journal in 2007 stated that doctors at Shifa revealed that ""The medical staff are suffering from fear and terror, particularly of the Hamas fighters, who are in every corner of the hospital.""
Hamas eventually fired about 600 doctors affiliated with Fatah, threatening to shoot them if they returned to the hospital.
After this, Shifa became a focal point during the Israel-Gaza wars as most media coverage started to come from correspondents reporting from the hospital. Israel had begun to warn the public of evidence that Hamas was using the hospital as their military base and warned that Hamas terrorists hide in hospitals.
Amnesty International confirmed this, reporting in 2015 that ""some were interrogated and tortured while otherwise ill-treated within the grounds of Gaza's main Shifa hospital. At least three people arrested during the conflict, accused of collaboration, died in custody.""
The Washington Post reported that ""the hospital in Gaza City has become a de facto headquarters for Hamas terrorists who can be seen in the hallways and offices.""
Even the Palestinian Health Ministry (not to be conflated with the Hamas-ruled Gaza Health Ministry) accused Hamas of using parts of the hospital as a detention and torture center and withholding medical care.
PBS even aired a documentary in 2006 featuring Hamas terrorists patrolling the halls of Shifa Hospital.
If all of this still seems far-fetched, in the first couple weeks of Israel's war with Hamas after the October 7 massacre, the IDF released footage of Hamas interrogations of terrorists caught within Israel's borders who flat-out admit that Hamas terrorists hide in Shifa.
The reality is that Hamas is definitely embedding itself inside Shifa hospital, which is why the IDF had created a safe-passage corridor to extract patients from the hospital and announced that it would launch a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area of the hospital. IDF spokespersons have reported that every couple of nights, Hamas officials show up at the hospital and fill up on fuel as if it's a gas station (which inevitably is used for their terror activity).
AT THE start of the operation, the IDF brought fuel, humanitarian aid, incubators, water, and food to the patients at Shifa to assist in the humanitarian crisis that Hamas manufactured. That didn't stop the defamation against Israel from the BBC, which misquoted a Reuters report about Israel targeting ""medical staff and Arabic speakers."" They later apologized and clarified that what they should have stated was Israel entered the hospital with ""medical staff and Arabic speakers"").
And as the IDF gets deeper into Shifa, more and more proof comes to the surface.
The IDF troops exposed a 55-meter-long terror tunnel 10 meters deep underneath the Shifa Hospital complex. The tunnel shaft consists of a blast-proof door and a firing hole meant to block Israeli forces from entering the command centers and the underground areas belonging to Hamas.
Even more frightening, the IDF released surveillance camera footage from Shifa Hospital from October 7 revealing Hamas terrorists forcibly bringing in a Nepali and Thai citizen whom Hamas abducted from Israel. One of the victims is seen on a stretcher while hospital staff stand by and watch Hamas bring them in. An IDF's stolen vehicles can also be seen inside the Shifa Hospital area.
The IDF also tragically revealed that they found evidence that Noa Marciano, an IDF soldier who was kidnapped and forced to film a ""hostage video,"" was murdered in the basement of Shifa (although Hamas pushed the lie that she died from an IDF airstrike).
One thing is abundantly clear here: Hamas is using a hospital for their terror operations. This is a violation of international law and something we can only expect from a genocidal terror organization.
The world should be screaming, but instead, outlets like BBC are fabricating ways to discredit the evidence, and organizations such as Human Rights Watch or the Red Cross not only remain silent but are complicit bystanders in Hamas crimes.
The truth is that we can show all the proof until we are blue in the face, but in the end, those who turn a blind eye to Hamas's war crimes have already made up their minds about the value of Jewish life.

The color of pure evil: A commentary on the moral inequalities of Israel and Hamas

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war has captured the attention of the entire world, evoking a myriad of emotions. The recent humanitarian truce has brought relief as families, including babies, children, and elderly Israelis, are finally reuniting after enduring nearly two months of captivity at the hands of Hamas.
Each night, Israelis are glued to their television screens, witnessing the return of hostages in a global media event broadcasted by Arab and international networks. The anticipation is palpable as people watch with bated breath, hoping to see innocent Israelis emerge from the clutches of their Hamas captors.
However, labeling the truce as a mere ""hostage exchange"" oversimplifies the complexity of the situation. Hamas has reluctantly released abducted children, babies, sick, and elderly individuals who suffered in underground terror tunnels in Gaza without adequate medical treatment. In contrast, Israel not only agreed to release convicted murderers and terrorists held in its prisons but also accepted a conspicuously unequal exchange, releasing three terrorists for each innocent Israeli.
Despite the significant concessions made by Israel, the nation's moral stance remains resolute. The safe return of its citizens takes precedence, even at the high cost of halting military operations and releasing Palestinian terrorists. This underscores the unwavering commitment to prioritizing the well-being of its people over other considerations.
The Sanctity of Life vs. The Glorification of Death
The most glaring difference between Israel and Hamas can be viewed in the fundamental belief in the sanctity of life and the glorification of death. The intrinsic value that the Jewish people place on life has come with a high cost, as evident through the hostage negotiations that have taken place throughout the humanitarian truce that began last Friday. While this has been a matter of significant public and political discourse, and even when faced with such a difficult strategic decision, Israeli leadership has demonstrated its adherence to the Jewish value of the sanctity of life.
As part of the negotiations, Israel has released Palestinian prisoners and detainees, in exchange for over 70 Israeli hostages innocent civilians ranging from children to the elderly, some suffering from cancer and other illnesses, without their glasses or medication. There is no moral equivalency between a baby taken from her cradle and kept underground and a convicted terrorist who will most certainly continue to spread violence against Israeli civilians. Hamas and their followers continue to praise the actions of violence and terror at the hands of their returned prisoners, while Israeli hostages are babies, grandparents, and young people who did nothing else other than go to a party to celebrate life.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli War Cabinet ultimately decided that there was no question that the return of Israeli hostages was one of the top priorities, alongside the total elimination of Hamas, despite the significant strategic blow to Israel's military campaign, and against pressure from Netanyahu's far-right bloc to hold out for a better deal as military operations would have significantly continued to weaken Hamas strongholds. This deal also enabled the supply of vast humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip for Palestinian civilians who are being abused by the oppressive regime that rules over them. But unfortunately, Hamas will use this ceasefire and the humanitarian aid provided by Israel and the international community to their ends.
The negative outcomes of temporary ceasefires with Hamas and the misuse and reappropriation of humanitarian aid have been proven time and time again. We have seen this in Operation Protective Edge and Pillar of Defense, as Hamas has used the cover of the ceasefire as a means to regroup, import more weapons, and steal humanitarian supplies for their terror tunnels. Hamas will most certainly take oil, medical supplies, and food to their base of operations as a means to outlast the impending resurgence of Israel's military operation, embedding themselves within the maze of underground tunnels beneath the civilian population. Israel has sacrificed its military advantage by extending a period, halting any intelligence and surveillance, losing more international support, and allowing Hamas significantly valuable time to regroup, rearm, and embed themselves within the civilian population that they are using as human shields.
The IDF is the strongest military power in the region, with undeniable defense and intelligence capabilities. Even with a temporary ceasefire hauling its operation, the Israeli army has the capacity and know-how needed to annihilate Hamas and kill every last terrorist commander, until the threat of the brutal regime is eliminated at its roots. Israel's strength also stems from its unity and unwavering national spirit. This is most evident in the statement of the families of those who were not released. While their pain will continue to intensify as the weeks continue with the void left by their loved ones still in captivity, they share in the joy of the children and grandmothers returning to their families. There is still a level of envy for the hostages who have been released, but they know that Israel continues to push hard to secure their freedom. It is this collective unity, the overwhelming feeling that each hostage is part of our own family, which Jewish people share and the understanding of the immeasurable challenge that Israel is facing that will continue to be a source of strength as the war continues.
The Theater of the Absurd
The release of the Israeli hostages has generated a wave of emotion that has swept over the entire country, highlighting the collective and conflicting duality of pain and elation, as children are seen running to their parents and loved ones. Like every other Israeli, I feel that each child is like my own, and while we are overjoyed to see the release of these children, our hearts continue to ache for the horrifying trauma they endured, which is starting to come to light as more are sharing their experiences as captives of Hamas in the underground tunnels of terror. 12-year-old Eitan Yahalomi, who was released this week, was forced to watch the videos of the October 7th massacre over and over, held at gunpoint every time he would cry. While Eitan's family shares their joy with the rest of Israel, Eitan's father, Ohan, continues to be held separately in Gaza, and their family remains fractured.
I look at the surreal video of Sharon Aloni Cunio and another unidentified female hostage in matching bright pink jumpsuits, each holding one of Sharon's twin toddlers, Yuli and Emma, as the group slowly makes their way to safety through a line of Hamas Nukhba fighters, armed and in full uniform, their faces covered with a black mask with the notorious green band tied around their head. Their father David is still being held captive in Gaza. This image of three-year-old twins being carried out of captivity, surrounded by Hamas' evil special forces, breaks the humanitarian mold that the terrorist regime attempted to stage.
Throughout the rounds of releases, the outward attempts by Hamas to portray an exaggerated concern for these hostages, holding the hands of elderly women and waving at young children, is a production of the theater of the absurd, a thinly veiled attempt to show their world their false sense of humanity. But what kind of humans continue to separate a father from his children, who have been held in deplorable conditions, sleeping on plastic chairs and eating little to nothing for days on end? The failed attempt to show their empathy for the well-being of their hostages, while carrying M16 rifles in a neutral zone is so pitiful that it is almost comedic. These same terrorists who abducted screaming children from their homes and slaughtered their family and friends in one day beheaded babies and kept old and sick grandmothers trapped like animals deep underground, now trying to show the world that they care make a mockery of human rights organizations and media alike who fall into the trap of the theatrical performance they have put on. The bright lights and exaggerated gestures, forcing Israeli children to smile weakly and wave under duress and fear of what will happen to their loved ones who remain a hostage of Hamas, is almost like a Hollywood production, only instead of California, they are at the Rafah Crossing.
But just like Hollywood, this performance is nothing more than an overly lit stage and bad acting. Hamas is spreading fake news, hugging hostages like they took care of them, but the truth is so evident. No level of acting can mask the horrors that took place on October 7th and no level of supposed compassion can overcome the true face of evil- it only underscores the extent of Hamas's psychopathy and the disillusionment of a world that seems to humanize their actions.
Still, we need to celebrate the return of each life, especially the women, children, and elderly, whose prolonged abduction has been the most heartbreaking for every Israeli.
The safe return of our people makes me feel proud to live in this country, a country that will always choose life over death, no matter the cost - a clear contrast to the values of Hamas, who are praising the release of convicted terrorists like Israa Jaabis, who detonated a car bomb near the Israeli town of Ma'ale Adumim, seriously injuring an Israeli police officer. Marah Bechir was just 16 when she stabbed a policeman and Ragah Abu Kias, also 16, opened fire on a group of Israeli civilians in 2021. Each has returned to their homes in East Jerusalem, where Jewish neighbors will live in continued fear of future terrorist activities as they continue to rally behind violent Hamas's poisonous ideology. These three terrorists were exchanged for 9-year-old Emily Hand, who was violently abducted by Hamas while attending a sleepover with one of her best friends in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7th.
But this is not a victory. Even after all of the hostages are returned, Israel will never be able to celebrate after the tragic loss of life that has taken place. There is a clear objective, and Israel cannot allow Hamas to remain in control of Gaza. Despite the military intelligence failure that led to the October 7th massacre, Israel remains one of the strongest military and strategic powers in the world. We can wipe out Hamas, but we are affording more time for a ceasefire to save as many lives as possible. Hamas will utilize the resource of time to rely on the relevant actors, such as Qatar and the United States, to put pressure on Israel to find a diplomatic solution. Arab and European leadership, as well as the vocal protests around the world, are being utilized as a form of psychological warfare against Israel, relying on the influence of external powers to supplement Hamas' military disadvantage. Hamas wants the world to force Israel into a diplomatic solution, which will also allow them to further poison Palestinian society in an attempt to upend any hope of peace and prosperity in the Middle East.
The coming weeks will be the most trying of the entire war, as IDF soldiers will be forced to resume their military operations with a significant disadvantage, but renewed fervor to stop at nothing until each of the remaining hostages is safely reunited with their families and the threat of the Hamas terrorist regime will be forever eradicated.

After the war: A two-state solution?

In their plan for ""the days after"" the current war between Israel and Hamas, both US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are reasserting their belief in the return of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to replace the Hamas terror organization in governing the Gaza Strip, and in the necessity to reach a ""two-state solution"" as the outcome of the Palestinian-Israeli dispute.
Such an outcome is also echoed by international leaders and organizations and, as in the past, is again being bandied about as a form of collective and generalized wishful thinking as the only panacea to the Palestinian-Israeli dispute.
However, there appears to be a distinct lack of awareness of the background, history, practical implications, and the feasibility of a two-state solution in the context of the history and changing realities of the dispute. By the same token, there appears to be a collective and naive illusion that the corrupt and ineffective PA could be capable of governing the Gaza Strip.
The phrase ""two-state solution"" is constantly being repeated despite the fact that the concept of two states as a solution to the conflict has never been officially accepted as the agreed solution either by Israel or by the Palestinian leadership. On the contrary, as agreed in the still-valid Oslo Accords, the permanent status of the territories remains an open negotiating issue. As such, repetition of the call for a two-state solution prejudges the outcome of the negotiating process and seriously underestimates the flawed capabilities of the PA in its present form.
Clearly, any concept of two states that would include the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel could only emanate from direct negotiations between Israel and a unified and fully representative Palestinian leadership. It could not be a result of any off-the-cuff political declaration or resolution issued by the UN or by any other source. Nor could such a solution emerge from vague and generalized calls from international leaders for a two-state solution as a form of collective wishful thinking.
AS HAS been the case with the Hamas terror administration that usurped governance of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, a politically and economically unstable and non-viable Palestinian entity would be open to manipulation by Iran and other foreign states and terror elements, and as such could never be acceptable to Israel or to the international community inasmuch as it would constitute a constant threat both to Israel's security as well as to regional stability.
On the basis of experience from previous agreements between Israel and the Palestinians, any viable, realistic, and permanent solution, whether this be one, two, or three states, a federation, confederation or any other political permutation, will need to include solid international guarantees - legal, political, and security - that such an agreed solution will not be abused, undermined, violated, or abrogated by any future Palestinian entity or regional grouping, and would not constitute a threat to Israel, its sovereignty and to the security of its population.
Before such an end may be achieved, and prior to any serious consideration of any form of a two-state solution, several central issues will need to be resolved.
First and foremost, the replacement of the brutal, Hamas terror administration of the Gaza Strip area with some type of viable, interim, governing framework. This must involve the mobilization of responsible and capable international elements that would oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip area and ensure the humanitarian and economic welfare of its civilian population.
This could be in the form of a new international framework established solely for such a purpose, with regional and other states committed to ensuring stability and capable governance of the Gaza Strip.
Another possibility could be an extended and modified version of one of the already existing international frameworks presently functioning in the area, such as the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) established by Israel and Egypt to supervise the implementation of the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. The mandate for such a framework would clearly need to be adapted, and the composition, in addition to the US, would need to be supplemented by regional states committed to peace and stability.
Alternatively, an updated, improved, and adapted version of one of the UN frameworks functioning in the area, such as the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) could be considered. However, any UN framework has negative connotations in light of the regrettable history of UN involvement in the area, especially as regards UNIFIL which has failed to fulfil its mandate set out in UN Security Council resolution 1701 (2006) of preventing the presence of Hezbollah in proximity to the border with Israel.
Ultimately the decision as to which interim mechanism would be most suitable and effective would depend on concurrence between Israel, the United States, and the international community.
Calls for the restoration of the PA as the governing body in the Gaza Strip are no less naive and uninformed than those calling for a two-state solution. This is especially true in light of the corruption rife among the leadership of the PA, its failure to maintain security within the area it governs (Judea and Samaria), and its policies of encouragement and incitement to terror - as well as its financing of terror through payment of salaries to perpetrators of terror and their families.
Only after stabilizing the situation in the Gaza Strip area, including the dismantling of the terror infrastructure and removal of weapons and ammunition, leading to its complete demilitarization - only then could it be possible and propitious to consider in the wider context, a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
Such a solution would need to involve a unified responsible Palestinian administration - and not a corrupt one like the PA - that would be fully capable of governance, and of fulfilling its international obligations. Only then would it be possible to consider viable options for solving the dispute - whether this involves one, two, or three states, a federation, confederation, condominium, or co-imperium, or anything else.
It will, of necessity, take time in order to rebuild a modicum of good faith and mutual trust between the parties. This cannot be hurried by flippant, irresponsible and non-informed calls for a two-state solution.
Time will tell.

It is neither easy nor politically correct to say so, but the serial truces Israel has accepted to obtain hostage releases from Hamas have run their course. At this point, their long-term disadvantage outweighs the immediate advantage achieved. Therefore, it is time to reengage the enemy in full-scale combat until its complete destruction.
Every Israeli man, woman, and child saved from the savagery of Hamas captivity is of course a joyous achievement, a moral priority that the State of Israel could not ignore even if it meant giving momentary victory to the barbarian captors. But the escalating cost of freezing the war against Hamas makes it imperative that Israel now revert to all-out assault on the enemy.
The repeat ""pauses"" in the war that Israel has agreed to are extraordinarily dangerous on many levels. First, the IDF has lost momentum in prosecuting its ground campaign against Hamas, a crushing offensive that was grinding Gaza into rubble and throwing Hamas military forces off-kilter.
The senior-most IDF commanders in the field whom I met this week in the Gaza envelope are taking good advantage of the pauses for reequipment and reorganization but are also struggling with the challenge of keeping their troops sharp and focused.
Worse than this is the fact that the enemy is reorganizing and getting resupplied and refueled. Worse yet still, Hamas has risen from its underground bunkers to conduct detailed surveillance of IDF formations deep inside Gaza, marking every IDF nighttime depot, troop headquarters, supply route, and so on.
There is significant reason to fear that at the moment the battle is reengaged, Hamas terrorists will pop out of terror attack tunnels inside the operational bases the IDF has built in Gaza. They will attempt, G-d forbid, to capture more Israeli soldiers or kill as many as possible.
Furthermore, after losing control over northern Gaza and widely seen to be on the run, Hamas is now displaying renewed near-sovereign control over Gaza. It is again demonstrating management of Gazan civil affairs including distribution of the food, water, and medical supplies flowing in from Egypt.
It is openly flaunting its fighters in full uniform and black/green celebratory colors in the ghastly nightly torture show of releasing Israeli hostages, to the whooping adulations of hundreds of ""innocent, uninvolved"" Gazan civilians.
Instead of erasing Hamas's control of the Gaza Strip - which is a key goal of Israel's war effort - the hostage-negotiation horror show into which Israel has been dragged is reinforcing Hamas's control. Instead of making it clear that Hamas is not a ""partner"" for anything at all in Israel-Palestinian futures, the hostage-release horror show is bolstering Hamas claims of a central role in Israel-Palestinian futures.
One outrageous, inflammatory example of this could be seen in videos of the 200-plus trucks of humanitarian aid that convoyed into Gaza every day this week. Somehow, wondrously, every single truck was draped with brand-new banners of the Hamas movement, proclaiming the splendid achievements of the current ""Al Aqsa War"" replete with pictures of the golden Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.
Wouldn't it have been more appropriate for Israel and the oh-so-concerned-about-Gaza-civilians international community, which funded and provided the truckloads of aid, to prevent the glorification and fortification of Hamas in this way?
At the same time, Hamas is gaining military steam and deepening its sway in West Bank politics. The IDF indeed is operating aggressively every night in Judea and Samaria to interdict Hamas terrorist assemblies, seize armories, destroy weapons factories, and arrest or eliminate Hamas operatives, but by all accounts, the pauses in the Gaza battle only add luster and motivation to Hamas fortunes beyond Gaza.
Then there is Qatar, the ferocious, two-faced financial backer and patron of Hamas that now is adding to its swagger and stature as hostage-release mediator. Israel is making a gargantuan mistake by playing into Qatar's game. Israel (and the US) never should have agreed to negotiations in Doha, only with representatives of Qatar in Israel or a third country.
Instead of sending the Mossad chief to indirectly negotiate with Hamas chiefs in Qatar, Israel should be sending Mossad operatives to assassinate Hamas leaders in Qatar. Instead of strengthening Qatar's heft in the region, Israel (and the US) should be acting to crush Qatar's hoist.
This again is an example of how the long-term disadvantages of truce and tortuous drip-drip hostage release outweigh the immediate advantages offered.
At this point, the only additional hostage-release deal that Israel should consider is a deal for the release of all Israeli hostages in one fell swoop, a deal that can and will come about only when Hamas is under the fiercest and most crushing weight of IDF attack. Only when Sinwar and his henchmen are truly on the brink of elimination and Gaza is about to be pulverized into oblivion for eternity - only when Israel truly threatens real ""humanitarian disaster"" in Gaza - might Hamas be willing to make a grand deal.
(What the price of that deal might be, in terms of letting Sinwar and his gang flee Gaza alive or in terms of letting the worst Palestinian terrorists out of Israeli jails and expelling them en masse to, say, Turkey - well, that is another, difficult discussion.)
THIS IS THE PLACE to reassert Israel's legitimate war goals, which have been badly undermined, alas, by this past week of horrifying Hamas hangdogging and hesitant, humiliating (although humane) Israeli responses.
Israel legitimately seeks to eliminate Hamas rule in Gaza, to kill or expel all Hamas fighters and their supporting administrators from Gaza, to destroy all components of military threat in and from Gaza, to reduce Gaza neighborhoods from which Hamas operated to rubble (as a matter of principle and not just for military advantage - and no, this is not a war crime), to create a new security buffer zone inside Gaza and along its entire perimeter (including the Philadelphi corridor on the border with Egypt) that Israel would control indefinitely, and, of course, to facilitate the return to normal, peaceful life of the 40+ Israeli farming villages and cities in the Gaza envelope/northern Negev.
And yes, Israel also seeks to secure by force the release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas and its terrorist allies - as many as possible, without any more poisonous pauses or tortuous truces.

In January 2009, toward the end of Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip, the commander of the IDF's Southern Command, Yoav Gallant, met with a group of reporters at his base in Beersheba.
The IDF was in the middle of the largest-scale operation on the ground inside Gaza since the Israeli unilateral withdrawal three-and-a-half years earlier. Gun battles were taking place daily inside Gaza, and while the military was meeting some of its objectives, the cabinet was meeting almost daily to decide what to do - suffice with the success it had already had or approve stage two of the operation and push deeper into Gaza City.
The direction was clear. Ehud Olmert, the prime minister at the time, was nearing the end of his term, and Israel was less than a month away from the elections that would bring Benjamin Netanyahu back to power. What was happening in the US was possibly even more important. George W. Bush was days away from leaving the Oval Office to be replaced by Barack Obama. The Americans made clear that they wanted the operation wrapped up before Inauguration Day on January 20.
Despite knowing all of this, Gallant wanted to continue. ""If I have more time,"" he told the reporters, ""we can take down Hamas."" He also said, ""If I have approval, I can get to [Hamas commander] Mohammed Deif and bring him out to the main square in Gaza City.""
It was a moment of frustration for Gallant who failed, at the time, to convince the political echelon to give him the time he needed. Israel had other considerations, so it decided, after three weeks of fighting, that it was time to leave the Gaza Strip.
Almost 15 years later, Gallant - today Israel's defense minister - now has the chance to finish what he wanted to do back in 2009: bring down the Hamas regime in Gaza and create a new security reality for Israel's south.
If up until 2009, Hamas had fired around 4,000 rockets into Israel, in the almost 15 years since Cast Lead, it has fired almost 25,000 rockets. The fact that it has taken Israel so long as well as the October 7 attacks to realize that this reality needs to change is itself an issue that will need to be dealt with. Israel fell in love with high fences and the belief that Hamas makes for good neighbors. Israel built safe rooms, invented the Iron Dome, and constructed entire schools and playgrounds in bomb shelters at astronomical costs. It now knows that it made a mistake.
The question for Israel now is how to define success in this war, and whether a victory is even possible, especially when the opening was so tragic - more than 1,200 people killed, 240 kidnapped and over 100,000 more Israelis displaced from their homes in the greatest refugee crisis the country has known since 1948.
When the war first erupted, Israeli politicians declared that they were going to ""destroy"" or ""eliminate"" Hamas. As the fighting has progressed, the goals have changed. They now home in on bringing down Hamas's regime, and preventing it from governing Gaza, rearming, or threatening Israel again someday.
""Destroy"" and ""eliminate"" were never realistic notions. They were declared in the heat of the moment, as Israelis' blood boiled over the disaster that struck the country on that black Saturday. But even with this more detailed objective, at what point will Israel know that it has met its goals? When will it be able to say the war is over?
Let's say, for example, that Israel manages to kill some of the top Hamas leaders in Gaza, but fails to secure the release of the hostages. Is that a victory? And let's say the opposite happens - Israel secures the release of most or even all of the hostages who are alive, but fails to kill Deif, Yahya Sinwar, or other top Hamas terrorists hiding in tunnels somewhere in Gaza. Is that a victory?
When considering toppling the Hamas government, the operation in northern Gaza is not going to suffice. While the IDF seems to be doing an effective job there - killing Hamas terrorists and destroying Hamas infrastructure - it has only done so north of Wadi Gaza. In the southern part of the strip there are still three Hamas brigades, thousands of fighters, significant infrastructure, and known Hamas hotbeds like Khan Younis and Rafah.
Israel will face three main challenges in southern Gaza. First, there is the fact that Hamas has had time to bolster its defenses there and prepare for the IDF ground forces. If Israel agrees to a days-long pause in fighting as part of a deal to release some of the hostages, we should expect even more fortification and surprises. Hamas watched what Israel did in northern Gaza and knows that it will need to change some of its tactics.
The second challenge is the presence of so many displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza. Israel, in conjunction with Egypt, the US, and the UN has been trying to get as many displaced Palestinians to move to an area in southwest Gaza called Al-Mawasi, near where the Gush Katif settlements used to stand. Defense officials think that there is enough room there for all of the displaced Palestinians, but there is a need to get them there. That will take time, a commodity of which Israel is running out.
The third challenge is the tragedy unfolding in Gaza. While Israeli TV stations prefer not to broadcast the images from there, we cannot ignore what is happening on the ground to more than 2 million people. Israel has every right to operate in Gaza and to target infrastructure that might look civilian but is actually military. But, with the north of Gaza already destroyed and the same fate awaiting large swaths of the south, it will be harder to ignore what is happening. This will create even more international pressure on Israel to wrap up the operation and allow for Gaza's reconstruction.
Then, there are the hostages who remain in captivity. The government is under tremendous pressure to agree to a deal even if it means stopping its military for several days. But, what happens if only some hostages come back and the others remain in Hamas captivity even once Israel declares the war is over? How will the public accept that?
The conditions for a decisive victory are not what we currently have in mind. Hamas will not simply surrender, and it will not be possible to destroy every last rocket launcher, every last tunnel, and kill or capture every last terrorist. It also might not be possible to bring back every last hostage.
Israel's leadership needs to look the country in the eye and tell people what to expect. After the trauma of October 7, people deserve to know where the country is headed and how long this will take. It is the minimum that a political leadership which failed a country can do.

Despite the expectations of a unified stance coming out of the Arab-Islamic summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on November 11, regarding the position of Arab-Islamic countries in the context of Israel's war against Hamas, there were some disagreements between the countries.
To start with, some major Arab actors prevented certain votes from passing against Israel, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain; alongside these four major Arab powers, Sudan, Morocco, Mauritania, and Djibouti voted against the disruption of oil supplies and against cutting their diplomatic and economic relation with Israel.
This disagreement, alongside other historical and political experience, indicates that the once unifying factor among the Arab world - to be against Israel - is no longer true for major Arab allies from the Gulf Countries Council (GCC) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Despite past ideological convictions of standing firmly with the ""Palestinian cause,"" today they are concerned about the economic and diplomatic risks of harming the relations with the Jewish state.
By this action at the Riyadh summit, the historical incidents, and the enthusiasm of Arab countries to maintain the Abraham Accords and the normalization process, it is clear they have grasped that the current war can no longer be viewed in the context of the ""Arab-Israeli"" conflict. This is a war between Israel and Hamas, along with its Iranian backers.
First and foremost, following the 1967 Six Day War and the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Arab world understood that they did not have the military capability to confront Israel in the region, even if they had sophisticated armor or weapons. The created concept of the ""Arab-Israeli"" conflict in which Arab actors like Syria, Egypt, and Jordan were the leading states supporting the ""Palestinian cause,"" existed until recently. However, the reality on the ground changed the calculation, so that Aran countries grasped that they did not have the ability to confront Israel, as it grew stronger. Consequently, negotiation was the best way to secure interests - rather than military confrontation.
Overwhelmed and exhausted, Arabs did not even participate in the 1982 war, when Israel kicked off its operation for the elimination of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in the South of Lebanon. Since then, all of the conflicts between Israel and other non-state actors in the region have not been identified as Arab-Israeli tension; and Arab powers no longer condemned Israel with a unified voice, and sought to normalize their relationship with Israel in various regional and international peace plans.
SECOND, MANY Arab policymakers consider ""the resistance"" to be troublemakers, both those in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, for the following historical reasons. First, Palestinian Salafi scholar Abdullah Azam was the founder of Maktab E Khadamt in Pakistan to pursue Jihad in Afghanistan. Consequently, Abdullah Azam from the West Bank shaped an alliance with Osama Ben Laden and then formed the terrorist organization known as Al Qaeda. At the beginning of ""resistance movements"" among the Palestinians, Azam was first and foremost the ideologue and spiritual father of Hamas as a pan-Islamic transnational movement for ""resistance"" athwart of the PLO, which has been discerned as a soviet-Marxist movement.
In September 1970, the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA), in coordination with the Popular Front for the Liberation Palestinian (PFLP) and the tactical support of Palestinian fedayeen guerrilla, wanted to overthrow the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan. After causing chaos in Jordan, ""the resistance"" forces were expelled from that country, but ultimately, in 1971, the Black September organization succeeded in assassinating Jordan's then-prime minister Wasif Tal. Lastly, the PLO and its leader, Yasser Arafat, displayed their alignment with Saddam Hussain's decision to invade Kuwait in 1990. This led the Kuwaiti monarchy to exile 357,000 Palestinians from Kuwait.
As a result of many historical events, Arab countries understood how ""the resistance"" could jeopardize their regional interests. For instance, Saudi Arabia's new doctrine considers Hamas a troublemaker. Now Saudi Arabia questions to what extent Hamas, as an Iranian proxy - similar to the Houthis in Yemen - can pose direct and indirect threats to Saudi interests in Haifa harbor due to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), inaugurated in September 2023 in India.
Furthermore, based on the lessons learned, Egypt has emphasized multiple times that it cannot accept Palestinian refugees from the Rafah crossing on its border with Gaza and has even built a wall across the border to avoid any attempt at a coup to overthrow President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
THE ABRAHAM Accords treaty implies that the current conflict is not Arab-Israeli. Despite Iranian intellectuals repeatedly claiming that the October 7 attack on Israel, named Al-Aqsa Flood, put an end to the Abraham Accords and the process of rapprochement between Arab countries and Israel, those countries are still eager to remain in the Abraham Accords - or to continue the rapprochement process with Israel.
For example, the UAE still wants to maintain its political and diplomatic relations with Israel. Also, there are many reasons on Saudi Arabia's side for pursuing the normalization agreement with Israel. From Saudi Arabia's perspective, the current war will not sabotage the Saudi-Israeli rapprochement, and Riyadh has been seeking this opportunity more than any Arab country.
Lastly, reading between the lines, the opinions of Arab intellectuals lead to the conclusion that they are most concerned with Israel securing a victory over Hamas in this war. Lebanese author Hazem Saghieh considers that were Hamas to win the war, their tyranny and their evil governing would exacerbate violence in the Gaza Strip. Additionally, other troublemakers and non-state actors in the Arab world would be inspired by them and begin a new trend of insurgency and posing threats to Arab countries. Ultimately, a Hamas win would enable it to spread its tactics and morals to other groups with the aim of shake the stability of those Arab states whose aim is peace at home and abroad.
The elimination of Hamas by Israel would be a valuable gift not only for the Gaza Strip but for all Arab actors who want to get rid of instability, terrorism, and insurgency.
The refusal of four major Arab countries during the summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to vote against supplying oil to Israel and for cutting their diplomatic and economic relations with the Jewish State demonstrates that none of the Arab actors (except Qatar) want a weakened Israel.
Based on the lessons of history, their own experiences and others, and more importantly, the bitter taste left after giving ""the resistance"" sanctuary, has led Arab states to the conclusion that Arabs should not stand against Israel - they should rather maintain their diplomatic and economic relations with Israel.
Finally, based on the same historical lessons and the eagerness of Arab actors for rapprochement with Israel, the current conflict is not being defined as an Arab-Israeli conflict. It is based on the terror and fears resulting from the Hamas's deeds on October 7, and thus the war is clearly Israel against terrorism.

Hezbollah, Israel exchange fire in North. IDF moves deep into Gaza City. Names of three more fallen soldiers released

As the fourth week of the war against Hamas nears a close, Israel continues to face threats on multiple fronts. Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi said that Israel has made significant steps on the ground in Gaza, ""operating in Gaza City for the past few days, encircling it from several directions, deepening the entrance, and we are also deepening the achievements.""
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant added: ""We have the capabilities to reach all the underground tunnels and we will do it."" Battles in Gaza continue to take their toll, with names of three more IDF soldiers announced: Lt. (res.) Yuval Zilber, 25, from Ramat Gan; Lt.-Col. Salman Habaka, 33, from Yanuh-Jatt, a commander in the 53rd Battalion; and St.-Sgt. Yair Nifousy.
To date 335 soldiers have been killed since October 7 when Hamas launched its massive cross-border massacre against southern Israeli towns. There are 242 hostages held in Gaza who were abducted by Hamas; four people have been released and Israel rescued one soldier this week.
Rocket fire continued from Gaza on Thursday, with more than 8,500 rockets being fired from Gaza so far. A house was hit in the coastal area of Israel.
In the North, Israel faced intense attacks from Hezbollah, beginning with a surface-to-air missile targeting a drone earlier in the morning, and missiles fired at the Galilee as the day went on. This set off sirens in numerous towns, and a rocket hit a home in Kiryat Shmona.
Two men, 25 and 24 years old, were moderately and lightly wounded by shrapnel, and taken to Ziv Medical Center in Safed. Hamas in Lebanon took responsibility for the attack, which saw 12 rockets fired from southern Lebanon.
The IDF said it struck in response ""terrorist targets belonging to Hezbollah, together with IDF tank and artillery fire,"" adding that ""the targets struck include military infrastructure, command and control centers, rocket launching posts, weapons storage facilities and military compounds used by the Hezbollah terrorist organization.""
Israel is continuing its ground operations in Gaza using precise intelligence, Halevi noted. ""This partnership is our secret. It increases our achievements and makes combat much more effective. The soldiers are conducting close combat against a cruel enemy, but with a clear advantage on our side - the camaraderie and spirit of battle that flows in our veins, the spirit of Israeli society.""
The challenges that Israel faces in Gaza and the North also exist in the South. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen have threatened Israel since October 8, beginning its attacks on October 18 with cruise missiles and drones that were intercepted by a US warship in the Red Sea. The group made another attempt on October 27, and this week there were more attempted attacks on Tuesday.
The IDF clarified on Thursday that ""in recent days, a cruise missile launched from the southeast toward Israeli airspace was detected by the IAF's control and detection systems. After tracking the cruise missile's trajectory, Adir [F-35] fighter jets were scrambled and successfully intercepted the missile."" The Arrow air defense also intercepted a surface-to-surface missile in the area of the Red Sea.
Israeli forces in Gaza continue to fight terrorist infrastructure, including with anti-tank missile threats. IDF ground forces work closely with the air force and also the navy to slowly clear the area. With the assistance of artillery fire and tanks, as well as helicopters, they are able to neutralize threats. The IDF said that during Thursday 130 terrorists were eliminated, as well as large numbers of weapons.
As Israeli forces push into urban areas, they are directing the air force to take out Hamas command centers ""deliberately located in civilian areas, as well as military compounds. Furthermore, as part of efforts to support IDF ground troops, an Israel Navy missile boat struck buildings rigged with explosives and observation posts used by the Hamas terrorist organization,"" the IDF said.
Commanding officer of the 36th Division Brig.-Gen. Dado Bar Kalifa, in a recent speech to his troops in the South, said: ""The day has arrived. We are taking the fate of our nation and people into our hands. This is our hour, and there is no one more fit than us. We will know how to fulfill every mission. We will fight until victory.""
The 36 division eliminated terrorists this week and struck anti-tank missile launching posts and UAV launching posts. Many senior commanders, including Halevi and Gallant, have been visiting key units, such as the artillery, combat engineers, and others in recent days.
In the North, the IDF remains well prepared for any escalation, should it occur. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is on Friday expected to make his first public comments since October 7, a speech that will be scrutinized for clues on how the group's role in the conflict might evolve, as 50 of its fighters have been killed so far, the highest Hezbollah death toll at the hands of Israel since 2006.
Iran is trying to unite various proxies and enemies that it controls or works with against Israel, and this includes Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, and also Iraqi-based Hashd al-Shaabi militias, as well as militias in Syria and Palestinian terrorist groups in the West Bank. Israel is focused right now on crushing Hamas's military capabilities, but leaders have emphasized that the country is prepared in the North.
The IDF said on Thursday it is ""carrying out defensive activities along the northern border, including observation efforts, patrols, and other proactive operations operating near the security fence in order to strengthen defensive efforts and immediately eliminate any threat. This activity is augmented by integrated intelligence collection on the ground and in the air to maintain a high level of readiness and vigilance.""
It added that the Northern Command ""continues to cooperate closely with units from across the IDF. The IAF, Artillery Corps, fire support teams, and commando forces are on high alert and are ready to provide an immediate and forceful response in Lebanese territory to any Hezbollah attack.""
Halevi emphasized that ""we maintain high readiness in all arenas. Operating on the northern border, resolutely fighting Palestinian terrorism in the West Bank with an emphasis on the Hamas organization, and are constantly committed to being ready for the expansion of scenarios to other arenas as well.""
He noted that ""we are fighting for our right, and that of future generations, to live here safely and prosper in our homeland. This is our home - we have no other country.

The devastating attack by Hamas on Israel has stunned the world, killing over 900 Israelis and injuring more than 2,600 in just three days. Additionally, the Islamist group has taken dozens of hostages into Gaza and fired thousands of rockets into Israel. This offensive action, according to Hamas, comes in retaliation for Israeli settlers entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to vow a decisive response, stating that ""the enemy will pay a price it never imagined.""
International response has been varied, with countries like the United States, France, and the UK expressing strong support for Israel. US President Joe Biden declared, ""Terrorism is never justified. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people.""
However, such statements have drawn criticism. Ali Abunimah, co-founder of the US-based Electronic Intifada, argued in Al Jazeera that Biden's endorsement could lead to an escalation of violence against Palestinians.
As the IDF counterattacked, the Health Ministry in Gaza reported nearly 700 Palestinian deaths due to Israeli airstrikes and clashes. Meanwhile, an additional six Palestinians were killed in the West Bank. As the situation continues to unfold, news agencies throughout the MENA region are grappling with a war that has multiple narratives and complex geopolitical implications.
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency published an opinion piece by Jaffa-based journalist Eliyahu Freedman with the headline ""I'm far from the frontlines, but like all Israelis, I am feeling Hamas' attacks firsthand."" Freedman described the ongoing sense of panic he experienced on Saturday as news of the attack was publicized.
An analysis by Yossi Yehushua on the Israeli news website Ynet criticized the Israeli military, arguing that a grave intelligence blunder was caused in part by over-focusing on the West Bank rather than Gaza. Yehoshua also cited a security source who said that the attack was carried out partially because of the recognition that Israel was facing an internal rift and therefore would be less capable of a response.
Marwan Bishara, a senior political analyst for Al Jazeera English, wrote in his opinion column that Hamas pursued this war to retaliate against Israeli mistreatment of Palestinians, among other reasons. ""Hamas' objectives in the operation are no secret: First, retaliate and punish Israel for its occupation, oppression, illegal settlement, and desecration of Palestinian religious symbols, especially Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem; second, take aim at Arab normalization with Israel that embraces its apartheid regime in the region; and lastly, secure another prisoner exchange in order to get as many Palestinian political prisoners released from Israeli jails as possible,"" Bishara wrote.
IN THE LONDON-BASED Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper, Saudi journalist and writer Tariq Al Homayed, a former editor-in-chief of the newspaper, described the war as ""senseless"" and said that Palestinians would end up suffering most of all from Hamas' military actions. ""Innocent Palestinians will be the victims, as usual, while the leadership of Hamas and the other factions watch on from the comfort of their luxurious hotels,"" he wrote.
Meanwhile, Asharq Al-Awsat's current editor-in-chief, Ghassan Charbel, urged Hamas and Israel to reconsider their approaches, calling on Israel especially to recognize the Palestinians' right to statehood as a step toward stability that could help solve the conflict.
In the Dubai-based Gulf News, opinion editor Sadiq Shaban wrote that the United Arab Emirates was mainly concerned with achieving a ceasefire and minimizing casualties on both sides. ""Both the civilian population in Israel and Palestine deserve full protection under international humanitarian law,"" he wrote.
An opinion article by Abdel Latif El Menawy in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm described Saturday as potentially the worst day in Israel's history since the start of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
""Israel classifies October 6, 1973, as the worst day in its military's history; now, October 7, 2023 will be considered among its worst, as well."" El Menawy argued that the war might lead to a new, better path forward for the Palestinian people.
In the Riyadh-based Arab News, editor-in-chief Faisal J. Abbas described the nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as cyclical. He noted the complexities of Palestinian politics, including the power struggle between Hamas, which controls Gaza, and Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank.
In keeping with the Saudi position, Abbas called on the international community to work decisively to bring about a peace plan and a two-state solution. He noted that the average Palestinian would likely bear the brunt of the conflict's repercussions in the days ahead.
Oualid Kebir of Morocco World News acknowledged the many factors leading to the current escalation in the conflict, including the regional roles of Iran and Saudi Arabia. Kebir's column emphasized the potential humanitarian cost and urged a more measured approach from all parties involved.
The Ramallah Mix Instagram page posted a statement attributed to PA President Mahmoud Abbas: ""Gaza is not alone; we stand by its side.""
Abu Obeidah, spokesperson for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, publicly thanked Iran for its assistance in supplying weapons, money, and equipment to Gaza.
Jim Ferguson, a former candidate for parliament in the UK, posted to the X platform (formerly known as Twitter) a video of Abu Obeidah's speech, drawing attention to it as evidence of ""Iran providing weaponry to their proxies enabling attacks on Israel.""
In the wake of escalating violence, the international community remains deeply concerned about the ongoing crisis. The situation remains fluid, with the Arab League's stance poised to play a crucial role in determining the path towards peace in the region. The world watches anxiously as diplomatic efforts intensify in the face of this complex and deeply rooted conflict.

Challenges facing Israel after 30 days of war

Thirty days after the Hamas infiltration, Israel finds itself entrenched in a Gaza conflict with no clear end in sight, all while IDF casualties continue to rise. The country remains under constant rocket fire, still reeling from the trauma of October 7.
Here are the five primary challenges it currently confronts:
No. 1: Diplomatic support is weakening
The day following Hamas's infiltration into Israel and the tragic loss of 1,400 civilian lives, politicians from across the Western world expressed their condemnation. They vowed unwavering support for the State of Israel. But 30 days later, as Israel continues to strike Hamas, killing thousands of civilians, the field has grown quieter.
Most leaders who visited Israel during this period have returned to their respective countries and have yet to revisit. US President Joe Biden, the first to condemn the tragedy, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have initiated discussions on ""humanitarian pauses,"" a stance that runs counter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position.
This shift in approach is influenced by mounting pressure from Muslim American voters who have expressed their intention to abstain from voting in the 2024 elections due to the president's strong support for Israel following the tragedy.
It is also because young American voters are more pro-Palestinian than pro-Israel. A recent Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll found that nearly half (48%) of young people say they side with Hamas rather than Israel in this conflict, and the same percentage say they strongly disapprove of Biden's pro-Israel policy.
During a recent tour of the South, a German reporter asked MK Sharren Haskel if Israel was not ""stuck on October 7, while in the Gaza Strip, people are dying every day.""
Israel faces frequent appeals from the United Nations for a humanitarian ceasefire as the memory of the events of October 7 recedes into the background of international consciousness and Hamas's propaganda gains prominence.
No. 2: Antisemitism is reeling its ugly head
Since the massacre, there has been an unprecedented 1,200% increase in online calls for violence against Israel, Zionists, and Jews, according to a report released last month by the Antisemitism Cyber Monitoring System (ACMS).
A rabbi was murdered in front of her home in Detroit. A Jewish woman was stabbed in France - a swastika painted on her door. And a mob looking for Jews stormed a Russian airport. Now, Israel has warned its citizens against traveling abroad.
No. 3: The country is experiencing collective trauma
Even before Hamas infiltrated Israel, a study published in International Psychiatry found that as much as 27% of Jewish Israeli children in some areas of the country had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. A 2021 study by Tel Aviv University and the Academic and Technology College of Tel-Hai showed that the level of personal resilience among citizens consistently decreased throughout the COVID pandemic and has continued to decrease - most significantly during Operation Guardian of the Walls, the 2021 Israel-Hamas conflict.
""This conflict will undoubtedly affect Israelis emotionally for decades and perhaps generations to come, placing a stamp of trauma, anger, and sadness, especially on those whose family and friends have been directly affected,"" wrote Jerusalem Post health and science correspondent Judy Siegel-Itzkovich this week.
Col. Lucian Tatsa-Laur, an experienced psychiatrist who heads the IDF'S Department of Mental Health, told Siegel-Itzkovich that while only a minority of Israelis will develop full-blown PTSD, the majority will experience at least some symptoms of trauma from flashbacks and avoidance to hyper-arousal or engaging in risky behaviors.
No. 4: Israel faces an economic recession
Leading economists have forecasted that the Israeli economy is poised to slide into a recession as the conflict continues and more than 360,000 reservists who are currently called up for duty are diverted from their regular jobs.
Last week, a group of 300 senior economists issued a letter to Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich with an urgent plea for the immediate suspension of all nonessential expenses within the state budget and a comprehensive reassessment of spending priorities to effectively address the impending economic crisis.
""The severe blow inflicted on Israel [by Hamas and the Swords of Iron war] requires a fundamental change in the order of national priorities and a massive diversion of budgets to deal with the damage caused by the war, aid the victims, and rehabilitate the economy,"" they wrote in their letter.
The Bank of Israel last month revised its growth projections for the current year and the following year, indicating that Israel's economy is now projected to expand by 2.3% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2024 as a result of the repercussions of the war. These figures represent a downward adjustment from earlier estimates of 3% growth for both years.
No. 5: The nation is embroiled in an endless war
As Israel enters another week of its war with Hamas, there is no clear endgame.
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Saturday night that ""at the end of the war, there will no longer be Hamas in Gaza, there will be no a security threat from the Gaza Strip to Israel, and Israel will have complete freedom of action to carry out any security actions it needs against anyone who [threatens us].""
This is a vision. It is not a strategy.
While the idea of ""destroying Hamas"" may sound appealing, the practicality of achieving this goal and the potential consequences remain unclear. Hamas is deeply intertwined with Gaza's social and civilian life. Disbanding the organization would necessitate not only neutralizing its military wing but also dismantling its civilian infrastructure.
Moreover, Hamas employs tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza and enjoys support in large swaths of the West Bank.
Hamas holds more than 240 Israelis and foreign nationals as hostages in Gaza, and Israel has said it is committed to securing their release. While one cannot verify Hamas's claims, the organization said Saturday that over 60 hostages were unaccounted for due to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. If this assertion is accurate, an escalating ground invasion could jeopardize the lives of these hostages and complicate the achievement of this goal.
Finally, if Hamas was dismantled, what is to say there would not be another terror organization waiting in the wings, such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad?
As a senior Israeli diplomatic source said Sunday, it is unlikely that even after a victory, Israel will not have supreme security responsibility in Gaza.

Gaza: A large, open-air prison?

Israel is in the midst of a war thrust upon it by the atrocious massacre of Israelis by Arabs from Gaza on October 7, 2023. Some anti-Israel media reports have tried to justify the barbarism by arguing that Gaza was a ""large open-air prison"". Despite the irrelevance, as nothing can justify these hideous acts, it may be interesting to examine this assertion about Gaza.
The Gaza Strip is a small, narrow piece of land on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, a mere 365 square kilometers (half the size of NYC), with a population that has exploded over the last century to approximately 2 million people, 2 million people whom absolutely no one wants, and who have been used as pawns by the Arab leadership.
The 1947 UN Partition Plan of the Land of Israel would have made Gaza part of the proposed Arab state west of the Jordan River. However, the Arabs rejected the partition plan, launching the 1948 War of Independence. At the conclusion of the war Gaza was occupied by Egypt, which refused to annex it or offer its residents Egyptian citizenship, i.e. Gaza was part of no country. That was the situation until 1967.
Thus, from 1948 to 1967, conditions in the Gaza Strip were harsh. Egypt essentially isolated it, refusing to integrate either the locals or the 200,000 refugees, leading to severe economic conditions. In 1955, a member of the United Nations Secretariat, James Baster, wrote in the Middle East Journal that ""For all practical purposes it would be true to say that for the last six years in Gaza over 300,000 poverty-stricken people have been physically confined to an area the size of a large city park.""
In 1967, as a result of the Six Day War that was thrust upon Israel, the Gaza Strip came under Israeli jurisdiction and Jewish Israelis settled in it alongside the Arabs who were there. As one example of a goodwill gesture, Israel helped Gazans plant approximately 618,000 trees.
Between 1967 and 1982, the economic growth in Gaza averaged a staggering 9.7% per annum, bringing an era of economic prosperity. But rather than continue to prosper economically under Israeli rule, the Arabs launched the bloody first intifada in 1987, resulting in hundreds of Jewish and Arab deaths.
In 1994, following the signing of the Oslo Accords, civilian control of most of Gaza was given to the corrupt and murderous Yasser Arafat and his PLO, henceforth known as the Palestinian Authority (PA), and in 2000 the Arabs launched the bloody second intifada.
Due to the Intifada, neither Israel nor Egypt allowed unfettered passage into or out of the Gaza Strip, with Egypt keen to isolate its problematic Sinai Islamist insurgents from the Gazan terrorists.
IN AN unprecedented and - with hindsight - disastrous move, in 2005 Israel unilaterally fully withdrew from the Gaza Strip, forcibly expelling over 9000 Jews from 21 towns. Even more surprising, Israel withdrew from the southern edge of the Strip known as the Philadelphi Route, handing over full border control to Egypt. Thus, began a new era - and since 2005, Gaza has been fully self-governing. European and Arab aid money flowed in and the stage for a flourishing Middle East Singapore was laid.
In early 2006, elections were held in Gaza, and Hamas won a plurality. For the next year and a half there was internecine fighting resulting in over 600 Gazans killed by their own, and by mid-2007 Hamas had full control over the Strip. The ""innocent"" residents should have known what they were getting - Hamas never hid their terrorist nature and their charter calls for the complete destruction of Israel.
Since taking power, Hamas has refused to recognize any prior agreements signed between Palestinians and Israel and they have ruled over the inhabitants of Gaza with a reign of terror. It has been downhill - under the rule of Hamas, unemployment increased, civil rights were eliminated, and missiles and terror attacks on Israel increased, leading to repeated mini-wars with Israel.
The ongoing Hamas belligerence has indeed led to an attempt by Egypt and Israel to control what comes into Gaza. Does that make it an open-air prison? As will be seen, if it is a blockade, it is not a very successful one.
One of the arguments is that Israel and Egypt restrict movement of the Gazan residents in and out of the territory. On September 19, 2023, Palestinian TV broadcast a program called Emigration from Gaza - what no one talks about, which claimed that in the past 15 years, about a quarter of a million young Gazans had left for abroad.
The bottleneck that has prevented more people from leaving is Hamas bureaucracy and the hesitancy of other countries to accept them. Just last month (Sept 2023) there were violent clashes involving hundreds of young Gazans outside the sole travel agency in Gaza City authorized to issue visas to Turkey.
In a prison, people might try to leave, but it is usually not possible; and if they do, do they return to visit? According to news reports, in July 2022, over 15,000 expatriates returned to the Gaza Strip for the feast of Eid al-Adha. They were excited to visit and reported that the markets were full with plenty of livestock for the festival. There seems to be an awful lot of traffic for a prison!
The medical situation is often discussed, with claims that the ""blockade"" leaves Gazans with poor medical care and lack of supplies. Yet drugs that Hamas wants, it is apparently quite capable of getting. On Oct 7, thousands of terrorists streamed into southern Israel, many of them high on Captagon, colloquially known as ""the drug of Jihad,"" or ""the drug of ISIS"", popular among ISIS terrorists for its leading to hyperarousal and hyperstimulation.
Additionally, the medical stats in general are quite surprising. The maternal mortality rate is 20 deaths/100,000 live births, better than Ethiopia (267), South Africa (127), Cyprus (68) and even the US (21). Infant mortality is 14.87 deaths/1,000 live births, far better than Nigeria (55) or India (30), and comparable to Egypt (17) and Venezuela (14). And life expectancy at birth (75.66 years) is comparable to its neighbors - Egypt (74.7), Syria (74.5), and Saudi Arabia (76.9). They have more physicians per capita (2.71 physicians/1,000 population) than Lebanon (2.21), Egypt (0.75), or even the US (2.61) and similar to Saudi Arabia (2.74).
What Gazans are particularly good at is reproducing. Over 13% of girls are married by age 18. In 2000, a New York Times article said it well: ""Gaza's extremely high fertility rate... is comparable to... Uganda's. But unlike those countries, almost all of the babies survive... .""
In other words, the birth rate, which has somewhat moderated in recent years, is like the third world, but the health care is far better. Indeed, it has been said that Gazans view the demographic route as a way to settle the score with Israelis. This has resulted in a staggering 40% of the population under age 14, among the highest in the world, and only 3% over 65.
AN IMPORTANT civilian asset is concrete. Is that getting into the ""jail?"" In 2021, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers (311 miles) worth of tunnels under Gaza, almost half the size of the NYC subway system. It is sophisticated and wired with electricity and reinforced by concrete. Building supplies thus seem to be entering this ""jail"", and workers are busy.
Unfortunately, it is not a civilian transport system but a terror network. The claimed shortage of housing has nothing to do with a blockade - the quantity of building materials, the cost of manpower and capital that Hamas invested could have built many new sports facilities.
And, unlike a jail, there are nice neighborhoods. Gazan CNN journalist Ibrahim Dahman describes where he works: in a ""beautiful, upscale neighborhood in which all press offices and foreign and international institutions are located."" Does not sound jail-like.
On some issues there is nuance and two sides. In the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, there is only good and evil. Some of those who want to introduce nuance claim that Israel has created an open-air prison. It is simply not true. Despite there being some degree of blockade by Egypt and Israel, and the claim that this has led to shortages in food and medicine, within that small area of Gaza there are thousands of rockets, unlimited machine guns and ammo, and enough cement for miles of underground tunnels.
There seems to be no scarcity of weapons. If that money had been spent on the needs of the people it could have been used to purchase MRI machines, computers for schools, and more than enough food for the entire population. Any problems in Gaza are not because it is some sort of open-air prison but rather because of the hatred of the Hamas leadership for both Jews and the Arab residents of Gaza.
Is Gaza an open-air prison? In a way it is. There are many restrictions placed on the residents - what they can wear, who they can associate with, what they can think, etc. However, this is not because of Israel or any other external element but rather because of the oppressive, evil, Hamas regime that has been strangling all life in Gaza for 16 years.

Hamas terrorism

The barbaric actions of Hamas on Saturday should appall every decent human being. They were shocking.
But they were not a surprise. Hamas is a terrorist movement and it did what terrorist movements do: murder, maim, and kidnap.
The full scope of Hamas's atrocity is not yet known, but the tally so far is already staggering: more than 600 murdered, more than 2,000 wounded, and an unknown number abducted - including the elderly, invalids, and young children. Some 5,000 rockets were also launched on Israel - every one of them a war crime.
This was an unprovoked mega-attack involving the invasion of the sovereign State of Israel. There's a reason people are calling it Israel's 9/11.
This was not about ""settlements"" or because of poverty or population density in Gaza. Hamas doesn't need an excuse to harm Israel and murder Israelis. It is the group's stated aim. The destruction of Israel and the massacre of Jews are written in the Hamas charter. They are part of its raison d'etre. In its DNA.
The significance of Hamas's nature as a terrorist organization can't be stressed enough. Hamas does not consider itself bound by the rule of international law. It is fighting a holy war, a jihad.
When the initial shock of the invasion's scope and severity wears off, world leaders who today firmly condemn Hamas will inevitably drag out their tired admonitions about a ""proportionate response."" But what counts as proportionate to a deliberate murderous onslaught that results in the death of hundreds of innocent people?
The world must not only recognize, but truly internalize, that when you're dealing with a terrorist organization like Hamas, the enemy is not playing by any normal moral rules.
Anyone who questioned why Israel responded in the past with live fire to Palestinian rioters on the Gaza border should now regret that Israel did not disperse the most recent disturbances. No Gazan, armed or unarmed, should have been allowed to get close to the security fence.
When Islamic Jihad last week held an exercise, instead of pretending all was well, the government, security forces - and any thinking person - should have asked: what was the terrorist organization practicing for?
When asked why Israel and Hamas don't just sit down and talk instead of killing each other, our response must be: ""For the same reason the US and al-Qaeda can't discuss how to compromise"" or ""For the same reason you can't hold a peace conference with ISIS.""
Islamist, jihadist, and other terrorist organizations are not aiming for a gentlemen's agreement and a handshake.
If anything, this is one of the concepts that completely collapsed on Saturday. Israel previously managed to put a halt to rounds of hostilities from Gaza by allowing an inflow of Qatari money and permitting more Palestinian Gazan workers to enter Israel on the theory that this would ease the overall economic difficulties there and hence reduce the tension and likelihood of attack.
We have seen what a tragic mistake that was. While Israel was making humanitarian and economic gestures, the Hamas regime in Gaza was meticulously planning its mega-attack. And this is another message to the world: You cannot appease terrorism.
Terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad - all funded, armed, and backed by Iran - feel empowered. Remember this, as world powers try to keep the Iranian regime's nuclear aspirations in check by lifting sanctions and allowing money to flow in. There is no doubt that Iranian funding went into Saturday's massacre perpetrated by Hamas.
Israel is at war with Hamas and other terrorist organizations. But from the terrorists' perspective, this is a holy war. And make no mistake: The Jewish state may be their primary target, but anyone considered an ""infidel"" is at risk - and as we saw with ISIS, this includes other Muslims, Christian communities, and people of other religions around the world.
Evil is hard to face and even harder to tackle, but the world needs to realize that terrorism is exactly that: evil. Hamas is a terrorist organization, the same way that ISIS and al-Qaeda are terrorist organizations, and they need to be treated as such. Downplaying the threat of terrorism when it is perpetrated against Israel endangers the entire world.

Israel can protect itself alone, but it doesn't have to - because America has its back, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a one-day solidarity visit.
""You may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself - but as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side,"" Blinken said.
He spoke in the aftermath of Saturday's grizzly Hamas assault on southern Israel, in which more than 1,300 civilians and soldiers were slaughtered and over 100 others were taken hostage. At least 27 Americans are among the dead, and others are missing or believed to be held captive.
While in Israel, Blinken met with American family members of those unaccounted for.
The United States was among a number of countries that rushed to support Israel, with top leaders from Germany, France and the United Kingdom also taking action and expressing support for Israel's military campaign to uproot Hamas from Gaza.
British Foreign Minister James Cleverly visited Israel on Wednesday and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is due to arrive on Friday. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala suggested that his country should relocate its embassy to Jerusalem as a strong sign of solidarity.
In Israel, Blinken affirmed US financial assistance and military support, which has included ammunition, Iron Dome interceptors, and the placement of the country's largest carrier fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, with a second one heading in that direction.
Great Britain has also pledged military assistance. The military package, which includes P8 surveillance planes, other surveillance assets, two auxiliary ships, three Merlin helicopters, and a company of Royal Marines will be on standby in the region to provide ""practical support to Israel... and offer deterrence and assurance,"" Downing Street said.
The flurry of diplomatic activity has focused on attempts to release the hostages, halting a multi-front war, ensuring Israel can defeat Hamas and creating a humanitarian corridor through Egypt for Palestinians in Gaza to escape the fighting.
From Israel, Blinken plans to travel to Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt to enlist regional support, particularly with respect to pressing Hamas to free the captives.
In Israel, Blinken warned Israel's enemies not to take action. The US reaffirms ""the crystal-clear warning that President [Joe] Biden issued yesterday to any adversary - state or non-state - thinking of taking advantage of the current crisis to attack Israel: Don't. The United States has Israel's back,"" he stated.
In Washington on Wednesday night, Biden clarified that the message was also intended for Iran. Hamas has long been supported by Tehran, but neither the US or Israel has proof that it was directly involved in the surprise attack.
""We're pursuing intensive diplomacy throughout the region to prevent the conflict from spreading - and I'll be doing that over the course of my trip in the coming days,"" Blinken said.
Blinken was in Israel as gruesome details continued to unfold about Hamas's massacre of entire families, burned people alive, raped, and in some cases decapitated its victims, including babies. A shaken Blinken said the Israeli government has shared pictures and videos of the killings.
""It is beyond what anyone would ever want to imagine, much less actually see, and God forbid experience,"" Blinken said.
There was ""a baby, an infant riddled with bullets, soldiers beheaded, young people burned alive in their cars or in hideaway rooms. I could go on, but it is simply depravity in the worst imaginable way.
""It almost defies comprehension. It hearkens back to ISIS, when it was on its rampage and was thankfully stopped,"" he said. ""This a moment for moral clarity, this a moment that everyone needs to make clear that there is revulsion, disgust, and determination not to allow this to go forward,"" he said, as he called for global condemnation of Hamas.
""Too often in the past, leaders have equivocated in the face of terrorist attacks against Israel and its people. That's why we've been adamant with all countries in the wake of these attacks: There is no excuse, there is no justification for these atrocities.
He compared the Hamas assault to the September 11th Al Qaeda attack on the Twin Towers, in which 3,000 Americans were killed. With Israel's nearly 10 million population, this assault, he said, is the equivalent, of ten such attacks -- or some 25,000 Americans murdered.
""The failure to unambiguously condemn terrorism puts at risk not only people in Israel, but people everywhere,"" he continued. ""Look at what just happened. Individuals from 36 countries killed or missing in the aftermath of Hamas's attacks. Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas - no region has escaped Hamas's bloody reach.
""Anyone who wants peace and justice must condemn Hamas's reign of terror,"" Blinken said.
He clarified that Hamas did not represent the Palestinian people ""or their legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity, and dignity. Hamas has only one agenda: to destroy Israel and to murder Jews.
""No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens - or simply return to the conditions that allowed it to take place. Israel has the right - indeed, the obligation - to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again,"" he said, cautioning that this must be done within the confines of international law.
Blinken also met with Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and President Isaac Herzog, as well as Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, who is now a minister in Netanyahu's government.
Earlier in the day, President Isaac Herzog said that Israel must have license to destroy Hamas. ""Humanity has to decide: Are we fighting terrorism or accommodating terrorism. There can be no mercy for terrorists.""

Calls for violence against Jews rise by 1,200% since Hamas massacre

A new report has found a rise of 1,200% in online calls for violence against Israel, Zionists, and Jews, following the beginning of the IDF Swords of Iron operation against Hamas. The statistics were collected between October 7-10, as highlighted by the 2nd Assessment Report released by the Antisemitism Cyber Monitoring System (ACMS).
The ACMS documented a concerning 157,000 posts exuding antisemitic sentiments, indicating a 450% increase from the prior four days. Paris emerged as the epicenter of this online hate, closely followed by cities like New York and Buenos Aires, as well as a substantial 360% surge when juxtaposed with the identical period in September.
X (formerly Twitter), among other platforms, is experiencing intense scrutiny. The European Union, concerned about the rampant dissemination of hate and misinformation, has zeroed in on these platforms.
In a series of rapid developments, Thierry Breton, the EU's digital rights chief, sent out stern warnings to both Meta (owners of Facebook and Instagram) and Elon Musk's X platform. Breton's primary contention revolves around breaches of the Digital Services Act, demanding immediate corrective actions.
Cities like New York, Buenos Aires, Santiago, and Los Angeles also show significant activity in this regard. Seventy-eight percent of the content is attributed to ""New Antisemitism"", predominantly revolving around anti-Israel sentiments.
Classic antisemitism makes up 16%, and the distressing spread of Holocaust denial and distortion constitutes 6%. Themes such as the demonization and delegitimization of Israel, along with conspiracy theories, are prevalent in high numbers.
Though radical Islam, pro-Palestinian groups, Palestinian nationalists, and the radical left emerge as principal contributors, the web of hate is diverse. Right-wing extremists, including white supremacists and neo-Nazis, are also exploiting the situation, peddling classic antisemitic propaganda with renewed vigor.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has been monitoring the state of antisemitism around the world since the outbreak of the war in Israel. Key events include a pro-Hamas chant in Geneva, the defacement of the Israeli Embassy in Bogota with antisemitic symbols, a staggering 1,000 antisemitic incidents reported in France within 48 hours, vandalism at synagogues in Porto and Madrid, alarming public calls in Sydney, a significant spike in incidents in the UK, and attacks on Jewish establishments in London and Bogota.

It was amazing how much US President Joe Biden was able to pack into a solidarity visit of just a few hours. Among the many people whom he met - however briefly - was Eli Beer, the president and founder of United Hatzalah. Beer, accompanied by United Hatzalah EMS responders, met with Biden following POTUS's meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet.
Beer was moved to tears when Biden embraced him and asked Beer what he had been told by UH volunteers who had been tending the wounded in the conflict zones from day one.
Beer told him about UH's 7,000 volunteer ""orange angels,"" many of whom are US citizens and who collectively represent the diversity of Israeli society, including Muslims, Christians, and Jews, both religious and secular, men and women, who risked their own lives to save others. Some of them were wounded and others kidnapped. Two of them, one Arab and one Jewish, lost their lives while providing assistance to the injured. Biden was deeply moved and said that he personally knows the pain of loss and feels the pain of the people of Israel in a personal way.
* POLITICAL CHANGES often turn yesterday's foes into today's friends and vice versa. Germany, which sought to resolve the Jewish problem, has become Israel's closest ally in Europe. Similarly, Croatia, whose notorious Ustase sadistically murdered the bulk of Croatia's Jewish community, is today fighting antisemitism and is in support of Israel.
Thus Zagreb was the venue last week for an emergency session of the executive committee of the World Jewish Congress attended by leaders of Jewish communities from 40 countries who met with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. Israel was represented by Colette Avital.
""Let it be known that the Jewish Diaspora stands unequivocally in unwavering support of the citizens of Israel and the IDF during these challenging times,"" said WJC President Ronald S. Lauder. ""In unity lies our indomitable strength.""
In thanking Croatia for having the courage to stand with the Jewish people, Lauder said: ""As history has shown us over and over, the Jewish people may be the first victims of totalitarian genocide, but they certainly are never the last."" Croatia currently serves as the chair of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).
Lauder was in the news in the United States last week, as being yet another billionaire philanthropist who is withdrawing support from an Ivy League university due to failure to curb racist intolerance on campus. Lauder, who has been a generous donor to his alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, has accused its president Liz Magill of failing to fight antisemitism on campus. Even non-Jewish philanthropists such as Jon Huntsman Jr., another Penn alumnus, who like Lauder, is a former ambassador, is withdrawing support. Huntsman has said that his family foundation, which has donated tens of millions of dollars to the university, will close its checkbook on future donations.
Huntsman was disappointed by Penn's silence over the heinous Hamas war crimes.
Similarly, earlier in the month, Leslie Wexner and his wife, Abigail, severed the ties of the Wexner Foundation with Harvard University.
Antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiments are rife on American university campuses, and Jewish students are being harassed and even physically attacked. Many are afraid to admit to being Jewish, though some are betrayed by their surnames.
* POPULAR SINGER Eyal Golan visited Sheba Medical Center and its Tel Hashomer wing last week not to sing to the wounded but to sit with them and hear the stories of soldiers and civilians. It was an emotionally draining experience for Golan, especially in the case of one particular family that was miraculously saved from the clutches of the grim reaper.
* AMONG THE many countries that lit up iconic buildings and monuments in the colors of the Israeli flag as a symbol of solidarity with Israel and protest against Hamas barbarity, were Georgia and Lithuania to the north and Australia and New Zealand to the south, though sadly, the latter subsequently backtracked. In Georgia, the Tbilisi TV Tower was illuminated in blue and white, as was the Palanga Bridge in Lithuania; and in Australia, it was the Sydney Opera House and in New Zealand, it was the New Zealand War Memorial Museum, a factor that rankled with the local Palestinian community. Pressure from Palestinian activists prompted the museum's chief executive David Reeves to issue an apology for the distress and hurt caused to members of the community.
If the Palestinians were distressed, it should have been over the inhumanity displayed by their fellow countrymen. Holding demonstrations that call for Palestinian independence and a sovereign state of their own is legitimate. Supporting terror, especially in its cruelest forms, is not only illegitimate, but immoral. The Palestinian citizens of New Zealand, Australia, and certain European countries are living in liberal democracies, but it appears that the values of these democracies have not rubbed off on their Palestinian immigrants.
* ANYONE WHO has the time to monitor the different kinds of support that are being given to soldiers and to individuals and families who have been evacuated from vulnerable areas in the South and North of the country, and those who missed out on being evacuated, because they live only a few meters away from the cut-off distance for evacuation, will be surprised by some of the ways that volunteers are helping the war effort. For instance, Emet V'Yatziv, a religious organization, working out of Jerusalem, is aware that there are thousands of soldiers who are religiously observant, and who wear a garment with ritual fringes known as tzitzit under their shirt. The knots and tassels in the fringes symbolize the commandments in the Torah, and the command to wear them is in the Shema in which men are instructed to wear them on all four corners of their garments. Emet V'Yatziv, aware that in war time soldiers cannot pay proper attention to their tzitzit, launched Operation Tzitzit among its many other activities. This is a multi-purpose mission run in conjunction with the Eretz Hemdah congregation, which received numerous khaki undershirts with holes at all four corners for the insertion of the tzitzit. The strings were acquired separately, and the correct number were placed in small, sealed bags, which were forwarded by Emet V'Yatziv to Eretz Hemdah for the knots to be correctly made and inserted in the corners of the undershirts. Emet V'Yatziv also works closely with Chabad of Talbiya, the Ohel Nechama congregation, and with the Friendship Circle. Rabbanit Atara Ote, whose husband is the spiritual leader of Ohel Nechama, monitors numerous volunteer activities on her WhatsApp account, and provides valuable information about activities such as a challah bake with women of the South; providing meals for evacuees with special needs who have been placed in a guest house in which meals are not served; a special event for children of the South with entertainment and lots of pizza; places for donations of good quality used clothing; and much more.
* AS GRATIFYING as it is to see how Jewish communities and individuals in Israel and around the world have rallied in solidarity with the IDF and with civilian victims of the war between Israel and Iranian-sponsored Hamas, the emergency funds established to provide for immediate needs such as food, clothing, toiletries, warm underwear, and temporary accommodation are inadequate when it comes to the real, long-range needs.
Numerous families, both Jewish and Bedouin, have lost their homes. The Bedouin have no bomb shelters and nowhere to find protection when rockets strike. They have lost loved ones and they have lost their homes. In addition, many fight in the army.
They are the sacrificial lambs on the altars of Hamas.
No one in Israel, regardless of their faith or ethnicity, is immune to the perils of war. When it's all over there will be many more people whose homes have been destroyed or damaged beyond repair.
There used to be Jewish jokes about ""my son the doctor"" or ""my son the lawyer,"" who was the pride and joy of semi-literate parents.
Today there is greater pride in ""my son the real estate investor,"" who is building huge residential complexes and even whole neighborhoods.
There is no shortage of big-time real estate investors in Israel and the Jewish Diaspora.
If they really want to help, let them all band together, to take on a joint multiple housing project as their combined gift to those rendered homeless by war.
Past experience has taught that neither the government of Israel nor the insurance companies are in a hurry to compensate families who have lost their homes through natural disasters.
War is not a natural disaster, but it is a disaster beyond the control of the ordinary homeowner.
If all the Jewish real estate investors, as a group took it upon themselves to list the total number of homes required to replace those destroyed in the war, and then divided that number among all the participating companies everyone who lost a home, would get a new one in a relatively short time, and would not have to go through the bureaucratic and often unproductive and disappointing hassles involved in getting replacements for what was destroyed or damaged.
Think of the challenge of rebuilding a kibbutz, or a neighborhood in what was once characterized as a development town. What a rewarding project that would be, especially in the knowledge of how much hope and joy it would bring to hapless victims of war.
Entrepreneurs Barak Rosen and Asaf Touchmayer, who founded the Israel-Canada Group, which has gigantic projects all over Israel, could lead such an initiative.

Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Elhanan Ariel Klein was killed yesterday in a drive-by shooting attack by terrorists in which his car overturned. Klein, 29, from Enav in the West Bank, was married with three children.
One year ago, Klein received a accommodation for killing a terrorist during an attack. While driving, he noticed a man throw a brick at a vehicle near Beit El, who then tried to open the doors of the vehicle. Klein killed the terrorist.
According to Ynet, he said at the time of the award ceremony: ""I felt that I acted correctly and from wanting to protect my people. I am happy I prevented an incident that could have ended very differently.""
Thursday's attack occurred near the Beit Lid intersection, close to Enav and Shavei Shomron. Klein was wearing his IDF uniform when the terrorists overtook his vehicle and fired at it. Klein lost control, veered off the road and the vehicle flipped over. He was declared dead at the scene by Magen David Adom paramedics.
The IDF has begun a search for the killers, closing off roads in the area.
A security source told Ynet: ""In a comprehensive operation to thwart terrorist attacks since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war, we have succeeded in preventing dozens; unfortunately we did not succeed in preventing this one. Their hours are numbered, we will find them and those who help them... and bring them to justice.""

The second day of the war with Hamas in Gaza began with Israel hitting back, with the IAF striking buildings in Gaza, while near Zikim, the army targeted five terrorists hiding nearby, later taking out two others near Zikim beach. I drove down to the Gaza border on Sunday as operations continued inside Israel against Hamas terrorists who had infiltrated on Saturday and massacred hundreds. The full details of the disaster are slowly emerging, with the stories told by survivors growing more harrowing by the hour.
The roads heading south toward Ashkelon, and from Ashkelon to the border communities, were largely deserted, as security forces began the clearing of the border towns, including Urim, Be'eri, Nahal Oz, Netiv Ha'asara and Zikim.
The remnants of Saturday's fighting were strewn everywhere. On one of the roads that runs parallel to the Strip, near Karmiya and toward Zikim, several cars lay abandoned, some struck by bullets, one whose engine was still running. Bodies lay along the road as well, some covered with blankets, with some still exposed to the hot sun.
While the area had been mostly secured by Israeli forces over night, the extent of the tragedy was slowly becoming clear. Terrorists had infiltrated from Gaza and threatened 22 of these border communities; most of the remaining members of which were leaving, driving in the opposite direction. Others were delivering supplies. A truck driver bringing a generator asked for directions, as several foreign workers on bicycles crossed a street in the distance.
This is an agricultural area whose sites and workers are usually active in the fields. But on Sunday, a quiet had descended, with the only noise being a few tanks churning up a gravel road, spreading dust into the distance. Explosions could be heard in Gaza from airstrikes carried out by the IDF, as well as the sounds of outgoing artillery and tank fire.
Terrorists continued to fire rockets at the border communities, setting off sirens. But the massive barrage of some 2,000 rockets the day before had dwindled to intermittent fire.
Along the border there was a sense of unease, because so much of the civilian life here had come to a stop with the massacres that took place in those communities. Many of them were founded many decades ago: Yad Mordechai in 1936, Zikim in 1949, Karmia in 1950 and Netiv Ha'asara in 1982.
Traveling this lonely road - now a road of death - was a trip back along the history of Israel, because some of the first Jewish communities here were founded before the state, the most recent ones in the 1980s. The two communities founded in 1949 and 1950 had seen threats from infiltration since the founding of the state. However, the attack on October 7 was unprecedented.
There was a sense of shock along the border. This area has seen fighting many times, but now it felt like the border area was unsettled in a way not seen in the past.
The contrast to the sense of loss could be felt among the IDF tanks that were deployed now in the area. The hulking metal beasts now provided security and a sense of power, deploying an iron hand, ready to be clenched into a fist. On one road a tank created a small traffic jam, as some civilians leaving the area and two men in a rental car tried to drive around the war machine, its massive cannon stretched across the road. Eventually the rental car gave up and turned around and a police escort helped the civilian traffic get around the tank. They were going to safety, under the watchful eyes of the Merkava and its veteran crew.
The second day of the war has brought some changes along the border. The evacuation of civilians means that many of these communities will remain empty witnesses to the memories of the Hamas massacres that took place at 29 infiltration points along the border.
The rising death toll stretches beyond 700 and thousands are wounded; the full extent of what happened remains to be known. But what is clear is that the old paradigm of fighting wars here has changed for good.
The IDF has deployed in these areas before, tanks have churned up the melon fields before, the dunes have seen terrorist infiltration in the past. But the extent of the terrorist destruction and the infiltrations is unprecedented, as was the total failure of Israel's vaunted intelligence apparatus to anticipate the surprise attack - on the 50th anniversary of the surprise attack that launched the Yom Kippur War! - and alert the necessary forces to engage with the enemy and check its advance.
Day two of the war provided a sense that something has changed on the border. Will civilian life return to these communities? Can life ever be the same after these events?

Ten myths to be busted about Israel 's war,"

Ten myths to be busted about Israel's war

As Israel prepares for tough battles against Hamas in downtown Gaza, it has no less difficult wars to win on the diplomatic playing field. The bad policy thinking and faulty paradigms of the past still dominate in many capitals around the world, and too many people fall prey to the enemy's propaganda. The battleground is global.
Here are 10 myths that must be busted, 10 arguments that must be won.
1. Neutrality: Reticence to condemn Hamas amounts to collusion against Israel. Hesitancy to express explicit support for Israel at this time, which also will mean unequivocally backing Israel in the many months ahead of tough fighting to crush Hamas, is tantamount to siding with the enemy.
Neutral and anodyne sentiments about broken hearts, heartfelt feelings, sympathy for ""all victims of conflict"" and other such mushy musings - even as Israeli Jews were brutalized by heartless barbarians who next are coming for the West - is profound moral failure and a stab in Israel's back.
Sympathy for the Palestinian People is understandable. To some extent, Palestinians are, after all, victims of their own horrible leadership. But this is the time for friends of Israel around the world to speak up loudly and unambiguously in support of Israel, not emote limp feelings of concern or equivocation.
2. Ceasefire: The call heard around the world for a ceasefire is neither reasonable nor right. This call must be rejected. A ceasefire now would be a victory for the radical Islamist attackers and a defeat for Israel. The call for an immediate ceasefire is in fact meant to neutralize Israel, to leave it exposed and weakened against the next attacks sure to come from Hamas, Hezbollah, and other proxies of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
3. Negotiate: Believe it or not, the same Middle East ""experts"" who brought us the failed approach to handling Hamas, are once again advocating negotiations with Hamas because it supposedly is rational and can be bargained with to achieve stability.
Hamas has an interest in ""economic peace,"" they tell us; a desire to reach understandings on the release of all hostages; and to rehabilitate civilian Gaza neighborhoods - if only Israel would play ball instead of bombing.
The obtuseness and blindness of these experts is astounding and their shilling for Hamas must be repulsed. They blabber away as if the October 7 massacres never happened, as if Hamas's true intentions have not been revealed. As if any compromise with Hamas is possible or advisable.
4. Distinction: ""Hamas does not represent Palestinians in Gaza."" We have heard this contention from President Joe Biden himself and many other western leaders, even some Israeli leaders too. Except that broadly speaking, Hamas does faithfully reflect the desires and goals of most Palestinians in Gaza, otherwise they would not have been elected by the Palestinians of Gaza and been able to draft tens of thousands of jihadists into its military.
Gaza's civilian population actively abetted Hamas in plotting against Israel, and thousands of ordinary Palestinians (not the ""Nukhba"" assault commandos) carried out the worst atrocities of the Simchat Torah (October 7) massacre. Tens of thousands have participated in riots on border fences going back years (which apparently served as cover for assault planning).
The ""uninvolved"" danced like dervishes around the trucks that hauled away the abducted men, women, and children of Kibbutz Be'eri, crying ""death to the Jews"" while helping Hamas hide them. ""Uninvolved"" mothers proclaim they are proud to send their children into battle to turn them into shahids (martyrs). And ""uninvolved"" teachers teach the children of Gaza that it's a religious obligation and heroic task to kill Jews. The ""uninvolved"" have helped Hamas hide its rocket launchers and other weaponry too.
This does not mean that Israel can or should target every Palestinian household in Gaza. Not at all. But it does mean that the soft sentiments meant to prettify a lot of nasty Palestinians, to completely tie Israel's hands behind its back in wartime, and to weaken Western resolve in backing Israel - are out of whack.
5. War crimes: It is Hamas that is guilty of war crimes, not Israel. In fact, Hamas must be held accountable for triple war crimes. Its barbaric attack on Israeli towns constitutes a war crime. Its use of civilians in Gaza as human shields (along with its expropriation of mosques, schools, and hospitals as bases of military action and weapons storage) is a second, compounded war crime. And its efforts to impede evacuation of the civilian population from the war zone (and in at least one instance, the bombing by Hamas of a civilian evacuation convoy that resulted in the deaths of over 80 individuals), represent a third layer of war crimes.
Add to this several additional war-related offenses like inflating and manipulating casualty counts, stealing relief supplies meant for Palestinian civilians (see below), and more.
6. Palestinian Authority: The suggestion to bring the Palestinian Authority back as ruler of Gaza is both ridiculous and dangerous. No Palestinian group is weaker, more corrupt, and has less legitimacy among Palestinians than the PA. Abbas and his Fatah party never could or would block the rearmament and rebuilding of Hamas.
Moreover, Mahmoud Abbas and his coterie are also no less hostile to Israel than the Hamas gang, although they use less Islamic terminology. So, don't delude yourself into thinking that the PA is the solution, or that a fully-fledged ""two-state solution"" is smart or feasible with Palestinian leaders of the near-term future.
7. Iran: Incredulously, Washington is reluctant to call out Iran for its leadership of the radical Islamic assault on Israel and its material support for Hamas, and there is a significant policy camp in Washington that still hopes for a deal with Iran after this war to ""stabilize"" the region.
President Obama's predilection/delusion for strategic partnering with Iran runs deep into the Biden administration. Few in the administration yet understand the current opportunity (and the absolute need) to cut Iran's regional heft down to size. This is a strategic and advocacy challenge for Israel.
8. Qatar: This small, opulent emirate in the Gulf has a history of playing both sides in conflicts and getting away with it. It harbors Hamas leaders, funds Hamas, and operates the equally evil Al Jazeera television network which plays an outsized role in fanning radical Islamic and fiercely anti-Western flames across the region.
There should be an American ultimatum to Qatar in which they are given two hours warning to expel Hamas leadership, or else troops from the US airbase in Qatar will raid Ismail Haniyeh's luxury compound in Doha and capture or kill him - just like it assaulted Osama Bin Laden's headquarters in Pakistan.
Yes, I know that the Israeli national security adviser publicly thanked Qatar this week for its role in trying to get hostages released by Hamas. I think this is a mistake and plays into Qatar's wicked double-dealing (and probably was said under extreme duress).
9. Humanitarian refuge and relief: Relief for Gazan Palestinians should be the world's problem, not Israel's. Egypt, for example, outrageously has sealed its border with Gaza to hundreds of thousands of civilians seeking safety, because Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi does not want ""to hurt the cause of Palestinian statehood.""
In other words, Sisi is denying Palestinian asylum seekers safety for geopolitical ends. This is a violation of international law and goes against the overwhelming practice of dozens of states in conflicts around the world over the past decade.
For its part, Israel cannot allow Hamas ongoing supplies of fuel and electricity during the war, therefore a blockade on Gaza is needed and justified. Limiting the flow of fuels and electricity into Gaza is meant to substantially impair the enemy's military capabilities, and thus is legal warfare. This is not unlawful ""collective punishment"" of the civilian population.
Furthermore, to the extent that such tactical means are meant to pressure Hamas to release Israeli hostages, the non-supply of fuels and electricity to the enemy is ethical and further justified under international law.
Note: International law requires only that Israel facilitate the passage of food and medicine to civilians by third parties if - and only if - such goods can be reliably delivered without diversion to Hamas and without fear the goods will give Hamas an economic and military boost. Given Hamas's 16-year exploitation of humanitarian aid and infiltration of human rights and international organizations in Gaza, diversion is not merely a possibility - it is a near certainty. And this has the potential of prolonging the conflict, resulting in greater loss of civilian life.
10. The Day After: Who will rule Gaza once Hamas is annihilated? What is the endgame? I don't know. This is going to be a long war. Who knows how the war will develop and where it will lead? And as above, this matter is the world's problem, not just Israel's because resolution is tied to broader regional battles. So, Israel is exempt from answering this question - certainly now when it must focus laser-like only on outright military victory.
Israel is rightfully fixated on its entrance and victory strategy, not on exit strategies and Palestinian rehabilitation. In fact, the demand that Israel answer this question now is pointedly meant to prevent Israel from doing what needs to be done in Gaza, so it must be rebuffed.

A ceasefire is not an option

The last couple of weeks in Israel have been absolute hell. I have struggled to write out my thoughts and emotions because the truth is that none of us in Israel have been able to keep up with or adequately process what happened. Every hour, there is another report, image, and testimony, each worse than the next.
By now, the world has seen the terrible images coming out of Israel, and what is worse is that only a fraction of Hamas's war crimes have been released to the public. On October 7, thousands of Hamas terrorists breached our border and committed a massacre that was arguably more brutal than the atrocities committed by the Nazis. The terrorists murdered more than 1,400 Israelis in one day and kidnapped over 200 civilians to Gaza. We have not even reached the final death count, and many victims have been unidentified because the Hamas terrorists burned their bodies.
While the October 7 massacre will soon stop trending in the media, we Israelis are preparing for the fight of our lives. We know it is only the beginning because we refuse to share a border with Hamas for a moment longer. When we say ""Never Again,"" we mean it, and living next door to an Iranian terrorist organization is no longer an option.
Public figures and media outlets are spinning this to make it seem like Israel is thirsty for revenge over Hamas's war crimes and that our retaliation collectively punishes the Palestinians in Gaza. Anyone making such sentiments has no understanding or experience handling a terrorist organization.
While certain members of Congress, such as Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez - both notorious 'Squad' members - have called for a ceasefire, what they are choosing to ignore is that a ceasefire will not save lives. While Israelis are well aware that it would be easier in the short term to retreat, lick our wounds, and attempt to halt the impending ground operation into Gaza, in the long run, it only prolongs suffering for both Israelis and Palestinians.
A ceasefire will not bring peace. When the world fought against Hitler, nobody called for a ceasefire because the world knew that such evil would resurface. October 7 clearly showed that Hamas and the Islamic regime in Iran are nothing short of Nazis.
First responders from Zaka (Israeli search-and-rescue organization) describe finding victims tied up, tortured, and shot, the exact way that the Nazis murdered Jews during the Holocaust. We do not want a ceasefire with a group that murders innocent people, rapes our women, decapitates our babies, and kidnaps our civilians. We will not negotiate a ceasefire with a terrorist organization or make peace with a terrorist organization.
So, we are now bracing ourselves for the impending attacks from the terrorists still hiding in Israel, for more rockets, for media outlets to whitewash Hamas's crimes, and for any Iranian proxy to take advantage of the operation with Hamas to launch an attack on Israel.
Anyone who has experienced terrorism or war would never wish it on anyone. As a journalist, I cannot deny the toll this would take on a civilian level for both Israelis and Palestinians. Even though Palestinians in Gaza are far from innocent, Israelis do not want to harm them. The Washington Institute published research showing widespread support for terrorist groups among Palestinians in Gaza. About 57% of Gazans support Hamas, and an overwhelming 71% support Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
With those numbers, it's no surprise that Palestinian civilians were parading the dead bodies of Israeli civilians and hostages on the streets of Gaza. Yet despite the overwhelming support for terrorist groups amongst civilians in Gaza, Israel goes to great lengths to minimize civilian casualties. Hamas and Islamic Jihad put Palestinians in harm's way by launching rockets from schools, mosques and hospitals, misfiring rockets that land in civilian populated areas, and blocking roads to the Gazan population to prevent them from leaving to a safe area. In the end, the Palestinians are suffering from Hamas's brutality.
Our only option is to rid ourselves and the Palestinians in Gaza of a Nazi-style terrorist organization. We understand the consequences of such an operation, but unfortunately, we have no other option. Ultimately, it will not be Hamas and its supporters that come out victorious. The terrorist group will join a long list of entities that tried to destroy the Jewish people and failed.
Together, the Jewish people and our allies will overcome.

There are two clocks ticking at the Kirya Military headquarters in Tel Aviv. One is the operational clock that synchronizes between all combat units in the IDF and helps them operate according to the same timeline, with goals set by commanders that need to be met based on operational directives.
The second clock is more fluid and has to do with the countdown to when the international legitimacy for Israel's ground offensive runs out. This is not something that can be easily measured and this week, we received a few examples of why.
Ian Bremmer is one example. A bestselling New York Times author and editor at Time magazine, Bremmer tweeted on Wednesday to his 760,000 followers, that Israel's bombing of a building in Jabalya, which eliminated a top Hamas commander and caused the destruction of a tunnel that capsized additional buildings, was a ""war crime. Period.""
The next day, Bremmer tweeted the video of Hamas leader Ghazi Hamad telling Lebanese TV that Hamas plans to repeat the October 7 attacks again, and again, and again until Israel is annihilated. This time, Bremmer tweeted: ""Can't imagine any country tolerating living next to a territory governed by this person.""
Bremmer is not the only one suffering from a split mind on Israel. Piers Morgan, the veteran TV host, tweeted to his 8.6 million followers after the Jabalya attack that ""even if a Hamas commander was there, it is outrageous and indefensible."" Two days later, again after watching the Hamad video, Morgan wrote: ""Disgusting... brazen... and of course, the reason Israel needs to wipe out Hamas.""
Morgan and Bremmer are not alone. A lot of people today in the world understand that Israel can no longer live alongside Hamas after the massacre that it carried out in Israeli communities and that it does need to be ""wiped out."" Their problem is that they want to see the war fought in a clean sterile way which unfortunately does not exist, not in Gaza and not in any war that is fought today in an urban setting.
WHEN HAMAS hides inside an apartment building or runs its battalion's operations from a tunnel underneath a residential complex, what do these people want Israel to do? They say that Israel should defend itself, and that they understand why Hamas needs to be destroyed, but when Israel does exactly that - while trying to minimize civilian casualties by giving people three weeks to flee northern Gaza - they bounce back to the war crimes allegations.
The reason is sadly because while the world says that Israel has the right to act in self-defense (not that we need their permission), when it comes to realizing that right and actually fighting, the world suddenly has an issue.
It is like the growing calls now for a ceasefire. If Israel were to agree to a ceasefire, it would be handing Hamas a clear victory. The terrorist group that murdered 1,400 people in the worst ways known to man, would enter a ceasefire with most of its fighters alive, most of its military infrastructure intact, and still in possession of 240 hostages. How does that make sense?
On the other hand, it is going to be hard for Israel to continue ignoring these calls. President Joe Biden, on Wednesday, urged for a ""pause"" in the conflict, and other White House officials are said to be asking the president to take a tougher stance with Israel. The pressure will be hard to withstand and while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could try to partially ease it by allowing in more humanitarian aid to southern Gaza, additional attacks like the one in Jabalya are going to continue to sway international opinion.
What we need to realize is that at the root of these calls is a simple misunderstanding of what Israel is going through. While people express sympathy for what happened on October 7, that is very different than supporting Israel's anti-Hamas offensive. It is as if there are people in the world who want to see Jews weak and attacked. The moment Jews stand up and fight for themselves - even in a battle that cannot be more justified - these people turn away.
By reacting this way, people are playing into Hamas's exact strategy. Hamas wants civilians killed so it can provoke sympathy from the West and get world leaders to crack down on Israel. They want buildings to capsize into tunnels that are destroyed so that people then die and they can then blame Israel. This is part of a sophisticated information war in which Hamas sacrifices its own people.
THE MISUNDERSTANDING runs deep. Take Thomas Friedman from The New York Times as another example. This week he wrote a column making a distorted comparison between the current Israel-Hamas war to India and Pakistan, claiming that when India decided not to retaliate to the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, that was a demonstration of strength and that Israel would be smart to study this response.
Putting aside the absurdity of that comparison - to start, Hamas is not a state actor like Pakistan that can be engaged diplomatically - the column continued down a path of utter disconnect when Friedman wrote that Israel should pause and reflect on where it is going.
 I want to see Hamas's leaders come out from their tunnels under hospitals and look their people, and the world's media, in the eye and tell everyone why they thought it was such a great idea to mutilate and kidnap Israeli children and grandmothers and trigger this terrible blowback on the children and grandmothers of their Gaza neighbors - not to mention their own,"" he added.
In other words, not only should Israel not be retaliating to the Hamas attack and not be attacking Hamas targets, it should allow Hamas fighters out of tunnels so that Friedman and others can hear from them why they did what they did. Can it get more absurd?
Let me clarify for Friedman what the Israeli government plans to do if the Hamas murderous leaders come out of their tunnels: it will eliminate them, and if I'm not mistaken that's exactly what America did in its years of war against Al Qaida and ISIS.
It is time to stop thinking about Hamas through an American-western lens. That was the exact error we all made for the last 20 years. Doing so plays straight into their hands.

There will undoubtedly be extensive discussions regarding the security lapses at both the political, strategic, and tactical intelligence levels, as well as in active and passive defense. However, in the wake of Israel's declaration of a state of war, our focus must now narrow down to a singular objective: shaping the policies and strategies that will lead us to a resounding victory over our barbaric and terrorist enemy.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the gravest security catastrophe ever experienced by the State of Israel has precipitated a transformation in our political outlook. Over the past two decades, successive Israeli governments have regarded Hamas in the Gaza Strip as a legitimate governing entity that could be managed and engaged through diplomatic and economic means.
Efforts to mollify the ruling apparatus of Hamas through financial aid from Qatar; the provision of fuel, electricity, and water, the employment of tens of thousands of Gazan laborers within Israeli territory; and the expansion of trade between Israel and Gaza were all pursued with the intention of fostering reconciliation and moderation within the Hamas terrorist government in Gaza.
It was believed that this approach would prioritize the well-being of Gaza's residents and even compel the terrorist organization to assume greater civil and social responsibilities.
After 16 years of Hamas rule in Gaza, an Israeli invasion of Gaza has become a fait accompli. Due to the expectation of the Israeli invasion, also on the part of Hamas and the terrorist organizations, Israel has been required to act with creativity and deception in order to surprise Hamas. It must carry out the invasion in relatively unexpected ways at times of its own choosing.
This military operation would necessitate the strategic division of the Gaza territory into districts and neighborhoods, with a meticulous, step-by-step purification process undertaken by ground forces and infantry moving from house to house.
This undertaking is expected to be exceedingly intricate and demanding. It is imperative for the citizens of Israel to comprehend that its outcome may result in the loss of many dozens, even hundreds, of soldiers in combat. One of the reasons Israel had refrained from such action until now stems from these very concerns and the profound sensitivity to the lives of IDF soldiers, given that entering Gaza is perilous.
Hamas and other terrorist groups have diligently prepared for this day, establishing networks of bunkers and tunnels, booby-trapping areas, setting ambushes, concealing themselves, and digging in their operatives within the dense civilian environment, among other tactics.
However, the events of October 7, 2023 have irrevocably altered the circumstances, compelling Israel and the IDF to make arduous decisions. As significant as the risks to the lives of IDF personnel are, it is now inescapable that the imperative is to defeat Hamas and assume control of the Gaza Strip for the benefit of future generations.
The issue of the Israeli abductees at the hands of Hamas must not limit or postpone the war in Gaza. Israel should act through diplomatic channels in order to resolve the issue, but at the same time it should invade Gaza and even try to free the abductees through military operations by special forces.
The occupation of Gaza and the defeat of Hamas and other terrorist organizations are expected to be arduous, intricate, protracted, and painful endeavors. The people of Israel must prepare themselves for this reality, summoning mental fortitude and reinforcing their national resilience in pursuit of the paramount objective: safeguarding the State of Israel and ensuring the security of its citizens for future generations.
Israel should utilize the ground campaign in the Gaza Strip to facilitate the voluntary departure of Palestinians from the territory. In other words, even before launching a ground operation and escalating the intensity of aerial attacks in Gaza, Israel should enable as many Gazans as possible to depart to Egypt, with no option for their return. The organized encouragement of hundreds of thousands of Gazans leaving the territory is imperative. This approach will greatly simplify Israel's control of the Gaza Strip in the post-war era.
Additionally, following the occupation, there should be a strong focus on establishing an extensive buffer zone spanning several kilometers between the Palestinian population that remains in the Gaza Strip and Israel's territory. Concurrently, Israel should promptly issue directives for the establishment of Israeli settlements in areas now under its control in Gaza, particularly those close to the existing border.
More significant than the elimination of terrorist operatives and high-ranking leaders, more substantial than the destruction of buildings and infrastructure, and more impactful than prisoner captures is the construction of Israeli settlements upon the reclaimed land. This is the true, most influential, and deterrence-enhancing victory for Israel.
A robust ground campaign in the Gaza Strip, encompassing the occupation of territories, the creation of new Israeli settlements, and the voluntary relocation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to Egypt with no option for return, will greatly fortify Israeli deterrence and radiate influence throughout the entire Middle East region.
ISRAEL SHOULD be prepared for the possibility of a multi-front war erupting as soon as ground forces enter the Gaza Strip. Nevertheless, Israel's resolute response, the unwavering commitment of IDF soldiers and the security establishment, and the perception that Israel is behaving unpredictably, act as formidable deterrents, effectively discouraging Hezbollah from embarking on a war.
The more forcefully Israel retaliates against Hamas, the more cautious Hezbollah becomes, particularly when the United States deploys its most formidable forces to the region and openly and resolutely supports Israel, coupled with explicit threats against Israel's adversaries considering involvement in the conflict.
The State of Israel and its people are grappling with extraordinarily challenging circumstances, which few could have foreseen or imagined. Now is not the time for self-recrimination or national mourning. It is a moment to rise from the ashes, stand resolute as a nation and unity government, demonstrate mental and national resilience, and concentrate on securing the future of our homeland.
The road ahead may be lengthy, and trying times may lie ahead. Nevertheless, Israel holds an invaluable opportunity to reshape the Middle East and the threat landscape it faces, deterring its adversaries for generations to come. This is an opportunity that must not be squandered.

Hamas to blame for Gaza, Israel civilian deaths - Romney

Hamas is to blame for civilian deaths in the Gaza Strip and Israel, according to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).
""You are going to see pictures of Palestinian civilians that are going to be injured, killed by virtue of the conflict, which is ongoing,"" he said Sunday in Tel Aviv during a bipartisan solidarity visit with four of his Senate colleagues.
""I hope you recognize that those individuals are being killed because of Hamas, not because of Israel,"" Romney said, adding that ""Hamas is holding their own population, the Palestinian population, as human shields.""
The senators arrived after the deadly Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 in which more than 1,300 civilians and soldiers were killed, and nearly 200 were taken hostage.
International attention has increasingly turned to the civilian toll in Gaza due to Israel's retaliatory strikes and measures, which have killed almost 3,000 Palestinians.
""They are using Palestinians to protect Hamas lives,"" Romney said. ""Therefore, when Israel takes action to try and go after Hamas and take out its leadership, there will be civilians and innocents that will be killed. They will parade that as if this is some horror perpetrated by Israel.""
""Do not forget the lives that you will see lost on TV... Israeli lives and Palestinian lives [lost] are all the result of Hamas,"" he said.
Romney also took issue with the growing US isolationism.
""There is a war being waged against free countries, against democracies, against freedom,"" he said. ""It is being waged by Hamas, Russia, China and Iran.
""Backing away and saying we are not going to worry about it is not going to end their effort. That war would only continue and spread further and ultimately involve more and more of humanity,"" Romney said.
Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said: ""America will stand with its ally Israel, and I will lead the effort in the US Senate to provide Israel with the support it needs to fully defend itself.""
""America has your back,"" he said, and the Jewish state ""has a right to defend itself."" He called on the IDF to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza.
Schumer also called for the elimination of Hamas and the release of all the hostages.
The purpose of the trip was partially to better understand Israeli military needs so that Congress could approve the most appropriate aid possible, he said.
Schumer said he understood that this includes intelligence and diplomatic help as well as precision-guided bombs, 155-millimeter mortars, and Iron Dome replacements.
""We will not just talk; we will also act,"" Schumer said. ""We will work to move this aid through the Senate ASAP.""
Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) said: ""I understand some of the operational and tactical challenges Israel is facing, expending a stockpile of interceptors that is not limitless... I will speak to members of Congress one by one if that is what it takes to get Israel the munitions you need to defend yourself.""
Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada) said: ""We know in this moment, in this place, we must take decisive action. You have our commitment to do whatever, provide whatever assistance you need.""
During their visit, the senators met with top Israeli leaders and politicians as well as family members of Hamas victims and hostages. They also experienced at least two air-raid sirens.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) told reporters there was no moral equivalency between Israel and Hamas.
""Israel supported the US in its war on terror, and the US will support Israel in its war on terror,"" he said.
Cassidy recalled the meeting the senators had with families of those taken hostage.
""One family member said, 'It's hard to imagine that the good news, the news that makes you happy is that your terribly wounded son is now alive and being held captive in Gaza, because the alternative is that he is dead,'"" he said.

On October 7, the world as we know it changed.
In the early hours of the morning, hundreds of armed Hamas operatives broke into Israel, launching a surprise attack on the IDF headquarters in the South of Israel in order to neutralize resistance for several hours.
They set out to perform premeditated and meticulously planned crimes against humanity, sent by Iran.
The terrorists proceeded to massacre innocent and unarmed civilians, inhabitants of the Israeli villages bordering the Gaza Strip.
Mothers were raped in front of the gaping eyes of their children.
Babies and infants were tied together and shot in front of their parents.
People were burnt alive.
Young women were gang raped until their limbs were dismembered.
Babies were beheaded.
Simultaneously, other Hamas operatives raided a peace festival in which hundreds were executed, gang raped, and burned.
All these atrocities were documented by the perpetrators themselves and proudly posted on social media.
The meticulously laid plans were found, in Arabic, on the bodies of those operatives who were later killed and/or captured by the Israel Defense Forces.
This was the beginning of a war that has little to do with Israel. It has everything to do with humanity.
The Iranian plan to dominate the region and spread its hegemony has begun with Israel because of their knowledge that it is easy to galvanize hatred, incitement, and fury towards Israel and the Jewish people. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hezbollah are pawns in the grand plan which calls for the involvement of Jihadists throughout the world to join the religious extremist Islamic battle against the ""disbelievers"" - that is everyone who is not of their kind.
As I write these very words, similar hate crimes are conducted in several European capitals in the name of this so-called ""holy war.""
Hamas, funded and trained by the mullah regime in Iran, was encouraged to set forth and begin its unholy crusade in the South of Israel while its members laid out, loudly and clearly, in Arabic, that the next step in their plan was to galvanize support amid Palestinians in the West Bank.
IN THAT arena, the Iranian backing of Hamas and PIJ has been long and systematic, working its way amidst the disillusioned population, vastly disappointed and disenchanted with its corrupt Palestinian secular Fatah leadership.
The Israeli government's longtime weakening of Palestinian rule in the West Bank, while allowing Qatar to stream in funding to the Hamas in return for quiet on Israel's Southern border, has also backfired.
The current Palestinian Authority - far from being an innocent bed of roses itself - is currently trying to quench the growing fury of its own Palestinian inhabitants as they are encouraged by Hamas and Iran to take up arms and join the fight against Israel and the Jews.
The Palestinian Fatah leadership in the West Bank, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, know that the Hamas will not allow them to continue their rule over the Palestinian people. They most certainly understand what Hamas is - and what a threat it poses to them, recalling that their own officers were lynched and thrown off rooftops by Hamas and its people, when the they took over the Gaza Strip in 2005.
The next step in the Iranian roadmap is the Northern front, where Hamas is also present, and Hezbollah has become the long arm of Iran.
Slowly, but surely, Hezbollah had taken power over Lebanon, disintegrating the beautiful Swiss-like country into a ruined, destitute, and failed state, while arming themselves with approximately 150,000 precision artillery provided for and funded by Iran.
Syria, too, has long ago been turned into an Iranian backyard in which despite the Israeli bombardment of constant shipments of weapons from Iran, significant strength and capabilities have been concentrated in it for the opportune moment to attack Israel.
Meanwhile, Iran is calling Iraqi Shi'ites to join in the ""holy"" war against Israel on the Northern front, while Hezbollah is attempting infiltration after infiltration into Israeli territory and shooting rockets at Israeli cities and towns in the North.
The idea is that a Jihad will be launched, worldwide, first against Jewish institutions and Jews, and then against all those who are not Muslim, including those who are not the ""right"" kind of Muslims, similarly to what ISIS did to Muslims in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere.
Indeed, this is a clash of civilizations of completely different proportions than an Israel-Hamas war.
The very understanding of the magnitude of these events is perhaps the first step towards beginning to create the international coalition and the solutions needed to quell it.
The next step is preventing the dissemination of this pure hatred and incitement, which is deeply entrenched in school books funded by European, Canadian and American tax payers' hard-earned cash.
Once these caviats are realized, then perhaps the international community can begin to create a new world order in which a much-needed coalition will be established for the purposes of ridding itself of extremist terrorist regimes such as Hamas and creating a real opportunity for growth for the region.

Yemen needs help

Even in the midst of a war forced upon it, Israel cannot forget that, not so far away, people are actually starving to death through the malign actions of the self-same enemy that bolsters Hamas - Iran. That Yemen could soon become an outpost of the Iranian empire is within the bounds of possibility.
If the Houthi organization, in hoc to Iran for its military and financial support, consolidates its already considerable grip on the country, Iran's so-called Shia Crescent will have been extended right down to the south of the Arabian peninsula. Such an outcome would represent a major political triumph for the Iranian regime, and a boost to its ambition to dominate the region.
October 2, 2023, marked a year to the day since the Houthis, controlling a large part of Yemen including the capital, Sana'a, refused to renew a UN-sponsored truce. Painstakingly put together by UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg, the armistice between Yemen's internationally recognized government (IRG) and the Houthis came into effect in April 2022. Extended twice, it resulted in the longest period of stability in Yemen since the start of its civil war.
So, on October 2, that negative anniversary was marked by no less than 48 organizations, struggling inside Yemen to cope with what the UN has called ""the largest humanitarian crisis in the world,"" publishing a long, heartfelt plea for action from those involved, and the world, to help relieve the situation and resolve the conflict.
Their document describes Yemen's economy as being ""on the verge of collapse"". It says growing inflation, combined with the collapse of public services, especially in IRG-controlled areas, is making life ""unbearable"". Since Yemen's refineries are not operating, say the civil society bodies, ""power stations are shutting down due to a lack of fuel... power outages in Aden are reaching 17 hours per day, amid soaring temperatures.""
The UN believes the nine-year civil conflict has left 80% of the population - some 24 million people, including almost 13 million children - in urgent need of aid and protection. More than 14 million people in Yemen are in acute need. Starvation is widespread. UNICEF (the UN's Children's Fund) reports that as 2022 ended, around two million children under the age of five were experiencing starvation-induced wasting, severely in more than 500,000 cases.
Meanwhile, the Houthis and the other major player on the scene, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, head of Yemen's breakaway Southern Transitional Council (STC), continue their ruthless pursuit of power. The Houthis are intent on defeating the IRG and gaining control of the whole of Yemen, while Zubaidi and the STC are determined to establish an independent state in the south of the country.
Zubaidi has a highly equivocal role in Yemeni politics. He is vice president of the country and therefore a member of the IRG based in Aden, but he is also the leader of the STC which advocates seceding from the IRG. Vice president though he is, Zubaidi is on record as believing that real power in Yemen now rests with the Houthis, and on September 22 he announced that he intends to negotiate with them over the creation of a separate nation-state of South Yemen, comprising eight governorates in the south of the country, including Aden.
ZUBAIDI'S COMMENTS came shortly after a marathon five-day round of talks between Houthi and Saudi officials in Riyadh. Houthi negotiators, together with Omani mediators, returned to Yemen on September 19. Word from the discussions was that they were negotiating a potential end to the conflict in Yemen, and that some progress was made, including a timeline for foreign troops to leave the country and a mechanism for paying public wages.
Some sources link the progress to suggestions that the US has pressured Saudi Arabia to end the war, perhaps linking its request to the complex US-Saudi-Israel normalization negotiations currently in progress.
An agreement would allow the UN to restart a broader political peace process involving other parties to the Yemeni conflict, including the Yemeni government and the STC.
Aware that the head of the IRG, Rashid al-Alami, was due to address the 78th session of the UN General Assembly in New York and that he was far from supportive of the STC, Zubeidi decided to visit New York himself. His aim: to meet as many world leaders as possible and press the case for an independent state in south Yemen. While there, he told an Associated Press reporter that the Riyadh talks between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were still at an early stage, and that his STC was planning to participate later.
""We are asking for the return of the southern state,"" he said, ""with complete sovereignty, and this will happen through beginning negotiations with the Houthis... This is the goal of our strategy...""
On his return to Yemen, Zubaidi issued a press release to the media under the auspices of the STC. Designating himself ""President of the STC"", the release begins: ""President Zubaidi stated: My inaugural visit to the UN General Assembly has been a deeply impactful and meaningful experience. I have had enlightening and informative dialogue with leaders from around the world. My message was the same to every person that I met: the only viable solution to the conflict is an inclusive and comprehensive political process under the UN's auspices. This process must include a mechanism for the Southern people to determine their own destiny, as is their right under international law.""
While these power games are being played out, the condition of the people of Yemen continues to deteriorate. In their appeal to the world, the 48 humanitarian bodies struggling to cope, paint a heart-breaking picture of what existence has degenerated to for large numbers of the population throughout Yemen.
To quote from just one section: ""Across the country, women and children are disproportionately impacted. Women often eat least and last, giving priority to children and other family members... Girls are at increased risk of early marriage to reduce the number of family members to feed, and as a source of income. Increasingly people in Yemen are being forced to [beg] for food and money, while children are at increased risk of child labor and begging...""
In fact, the situation is intolerable. Negotiations aimed at ending the civil conflict need to be conducted with a great deal more urgency, while Yemen undoubtedly merits an internationally backed humanitarian rescue effort.

Destroying Hamas and giving the Abraham Accords a victory

On the morning of May 11, 2021, I arrived earlier than usual at my office in the Israeli Regional Cooperation Ministry, at that time located next to the Kirya in Tel Aviv.
I had been working on the implementation and advancement of the Abraham Accords, which had come into being the previous summer. It was the most peaceful time Israel had ever known.
But suddenly that changed.
Hamas started firing hundreds of rockets into Israel. Horrific scenes of arson and violence broke out in mixed cities such as Lod and Acre, which were set on fire by Islamists.
Israel was forced to respond, and the IDF launched Operation Guardian of the Walls, targeting Hamas terrorists in Gaza.
After dealing with peace, we were back to dealing with war.
The big question on everyone's mind was: Would the Abraham Accords survive this?
I immediately got on the phone with my colleagues in each of the Abraham Accords countries: United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, Kosovo, and Morocco.
Those phone calls went very well. Each of my counterparts relayed to me that they understood exactly what we in Israel were going through. They wished us safety and made it clear that we had their support.
While I appreciated their kind words over the phone, I had significant doubts that it would translate to public statements. I was certain they would put all the blame on Israel when speaking on record out in the open.
To my pleasant surprise, I was wrong.
The UAE foreign minister put out a statement calling for calm, emphasizing the need to preserve the Abraham Accords. This was a much more even-handed statement than I had anticipated.
The other Abraham Accords countries followed suit and put out mostly neutral statements. Even if they showed sympathy with the Palestinians, they stopped short of solely blaming Israel.
I was relieved.
When briefing my boss at the time, Israel's then-regional cooperation minister Ofir Akunis, I told him I believed the Abraham Accords would pass this test.
Indeed they did.
Just a few weeks after the war in 2021, Israel inaugurated its embassy in Abu Dhabi and its consulate in Dubai. Two weeks later, the first direct commercial flights between Israel and Morocco were launched - and I was honored to be on that first flight. Soon afterwards, Israel inaugurated its embassy in Bahrain and its Liaison Office in Rabat.
It became clear to everyone that the Abraham Accords survived Operation Guardian of the Walls and the peace treaties were on track to keep growing.
TODAY, WE find ourselves in a similar situation.
The terrorist attacks launched by Hamas on October 7 were the deadliest on Jews since the Holocaust and on Americans since 9/11.
The Hamas terrorists beheaded babies and burned their parents alive. They destroyed entire villages and homes. They murdered more than 1,400 Israelis, injured more than 5,000, and kidnapped well over 200.
The UAE and Bahrain immediately issued condemnations of Hamas. Kosovo's president and prime minister both published statements in solidarity with Israel. Sudan has not reacted publicly thus far, while Morocco issued a condemnation of the attacks on civilians.
In a recent address UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation Reem Al Hashimy condemned Hamas for their heinous and barbaric attacks and reiterated that the hostages be released immediately without any preconditions.
UAE Ambassador to the United Nations Lana Zaki Nusseibeh also affirmed her country's commitment to the Abraham Accords and even backtracked from blaming Israel for the explosion of the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza, publicly admitting that it needed further investigation.
Ines Demiri, the chief of mission at Kosovo's embassy in Jerusalem visited the Israeli communities on the Gaza border to show solidarity with the victims.
While Morocco has been sympathetic to the Palestinians in most of their public statements, in Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita's most recent speech in Cairo, he stopped short of placing any specific blame on Israel.
To ensure this relationship endures, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rightfully reaffirmed Israel's recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Sahara this past week.
There are numerous ongoing joint economic ventures between Abraham Accords countries in the areas of water, energy, food, healthcare, and more. These collaborations greatly benefit the people of the region.
Yet despite the war, both the UAE minister of state for foreign trade and the Bahraini finance minister continue to publicly reaffirm the importance of the Abraham Accords and their economic benefits in trade and investment. Moroccan media outlets have urged the same.
Granted, the public statements coming from Abraham Accords countries during this war aren't always perfect. In fact, some of the statements were disappointing and fell short of their expectations, particularly after Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza.
Yet the recent improvement in the tone of these statements, and the willingness of the Abraham Accords countries to condemn Hamas, is something that was unimaginable until just a few years ago. It's important to read between the lines of these statements and applaud every step of progress made, no matter how small.
IT IS also important to acknowledge the elephant in the room. In this war, Israel and the Abraham Accords countries share the same threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran. Hamas, which attacks Israel, is armed and funded by Iran. The Houthis, which attack the UAE and Bahrain, are armed and funded by Iran. The Polisario Front, which attacks Morocco, is armed and funded by Iran.
Over the course of this week alone, the Houthis fired a UAV across the Red Sea, the Polisario fired missiles at Morocco, all while Hamas continues firing on Israel.
Too often people don't connect the dots. We must pay attention to the man behind the curtain. These terrorist organizations are branches of the same poisonous Iranian tree.
Without Iran, these attacks would not have been possible to begin with. Iran must face harsh consequences and not be allowed to escape responsibility.
We must also acknowledge the destabilizing actions of other countries in the region that harbor Hamas leaders and finance their terror networks, such as Qatar, Turkey, and Algeria. These countries must also be held accountable.
The Abraham Accords were created on the basis of peace through strength. The accords countries therefore see an interest in maintaining ties with Israel, as it fights these shared enemies.
And when Israel indeed destroys Hamas, as it has rightfully announced its intention to do, it will send a huge message of deterrence to other Iran-backed terrorist organizations that threaten the Gulf and Africa.
To those who believe an all-out war on Hamas will damage the Abraham Accords: There is nothing our Abraham Accords partners would be more excited to see than the destruction and elimination of one of Iran's terror proxies. It would be much more damaging to the Abraham Accords if Israel was forced into a ceasefire and wasn't able to destroy Hamas.
A victorious Israel means a stronger, safer, and more stable environment for Abraham Accords countries. This is not only the formula for maintaining the Abraham Accords, but for expanding them to new countries.
As was the case in May 2021, I am confident that the Abraham Accords will survive this war too.
And when Israel eliminates Hamas to win this war, the Abraham Accords will emerge stronger than ever before.
The writer is deputy director for Israel at the Abraham Accords Peace Institute. He previously served as senior adviser to Israel's regional cooperation minister during the signing of the Abraham Accords and the launch of Operation Guardian of the Walls.

Second aid convoy enters Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens

A second convoy of aid trucks entered the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on Sunday en route to the Gaza Strip, as the US continued to stress the importance of humanitarian assistance to the war-torn enclave of 2.3 million people.
""We want to make sure that we have sustained delivery of food, medicine, water, the things that people need,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CBS on Sunday.
There were a total of about 19 trucks in Sunday's convoy carrying medical and food supplies, security and humanitarian sources said.
A first convoy of 20 trucks of badly needed supplies entered Gaza on Saturday through Rafah, which had previously been out of operation after bombardments hit the Gaza side of the border. Wrangling over conditions for delivering aid also delayed the convoy's arrival.
Distribution of those supplies began on Sunday, but aid officials were still warning of a humanitarian disaster as supplies of food, water, and fuel ran low.
Israel had closed its two crossing into Gaza and prevented all food, fuel, electricity, and food from reaching the Strip until Hamas released the 212 captives it took during its October 7 infiltration into Israel. During the terrorist attack, more than 1,400 civilians and soldiers were killed.
More than 4,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since then, either due to IAF airstrikes or failed Palestinian rocket launches. It is estimated that some one million Palestinians have fled their homes.
David Satterfield, the US special envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, on Sunday told MSNBC he was working on creating a mechanism for the regular flow of aid.
Satterfield was also trying to convince Israel to restore the flow of water through pipelines into Gaza.
US President Joe Biden spoke with Pope Francis on Sunday and discussed the war between Israel and Hamas, the White House and the Vatican said in separate statements. Biden also spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He has personally been involved in restoring humanitarian aid to Gaza.
The Rafah crossing, the main entry and exit point to Gaza that does not lead to Israel, has become the focus of a push to deliver aid as humanitarian conditions in Gaza worsen.
UN officials say at least 100 trucks a day would be required in Gaza to cover urgent needs. Before the outbreak of the war, several hundred trucks had been arriving in the enclave daily.
Work was under way to develop a ""light"" inspection system, whereby Israel could check the shipments but ensure a sustained flow, UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths told Reuters on Saturday.

It was a period of euphoria. In June 1967, Israel defeated three Arab armies in just six days and tripled in size. The country was on a high and Jews from around the world responded in kind.
If aliyah to Israel in 1967 was just 15,000, by 1968 it had jumped to 20,000 and by 1973 to almost 55,000. During this five-year period, some 30,000 American Jews moved to Israel, an unprecedented number. In 1966, for example, only 826 Jews immigrated from North America. By 1973 that number had skyrocketed to almost 5,000. Even today, despite the existence of special organizations to ease the aliyah process from the US, the numbers are barely half of what it was 50 years ago.
And while this large number of olim (immigrants) seemed impossible just a few years earlier, it was clear why it was happening: Israel was perceived as successful and powerful. Fresh out of a miraculous victory, Israel was a place to which people wanted to tie their fate. It was riding a wave that came crashing down with the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in October 1973.
Aliyah came crashing down as well. In all of 1974, about 32,000 people moved to Israel, a drop of 23,000 and by 1975, the number was down by almost 70%.
The lesson was obvious. Perception of Israel and its power is important, not just for the country's efforts to deter its enemies, but also for how it is perceived by fellow Jews around the world. When the country is perceived as strong and successful, Jews rally behind it and decide to tie their fate to it. When, after the Yom Kippur War, Israel was perceived as vulnerable, weak, and failing, the number of people who wanted to be connected to here fell.
And this is an important lesson today as Israel's war against Hamas continues in the Gaza Strip. On the surface, in wake of the attacks on October 7, Israel is creating a new security paradigm in southern Israel. It is operating in Gaza to degrade Hamas's military capabilities, to kill or capture its leaders, and to remove it as the governing authority in the Gaza Strip. The days of containing the Hamas enemy are clearly over.
No matter how this war ends, Israel will also now need to change the substance of its relationship with Diaspora Jewry and declare that what was, will no longer be. All Israelis have been moved to see how Jews from around the world have stood up to assist Israel during this difficult time. There are those who donated money, others who have come here on solidarity missions to volunteer, and even more who have lined the streets of New York, London, Sydney, and Paris, with posters of the hostages and Israeli flags, at rallies in support of Israel's battle to defeat Hamas.
THEY HAVE done so despite the explosion of antisemitism and the risk that it now poses to the future of American, British, and European Jewry. While Jews in Israel are obviously most at risk of physical harm, the killing of Paul Kessler at a pro-Israel rally in Los Angeles, and the death chants against Jews in Dagestan, as well as on the streets of London, indicate how antisemitism shows, to some extent, how all Jews are in a similar situation.
What we have to keep in mind is the objective of the protesters against Israel and the threat it poses to Jews. They want people to be afraid to speak up, to appear in public in support of Israel and to proudly identify as Jews. They want Jews to be afraid, to removed mezuzot from their front doors like in Paris and to remove their kippot (skullcaps) or any other Jewish markings.
The explosion in antisemitism shows just how intertwined the fate of Jews around the globe is to Israel, whether they support or care about what is happening here or not. They are immediately blamed for the IDF action and, as a result, Israel cannot ignore the Diaspora plight.
What Israel needs to do now is twofold. On the one hand, it should prepare for a possible increase in aliyah. As Jews face growing antisemitism, there might be a rise in the number of people who want to move here. The second step is to empower Jews around the world with the knowledge that Israel is the home of all Jews, no matter where they come from and how they practice their religion.
When Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for example, praised Diaspora Jewry this week for donating over $1 billion to Israel Bonds, he wrote that ""Diaspora Jews and the people of Israel stand together in the battle for the victory of light over darkness.""
While that sounds nice in a tweet, Smotrich needs to back that up with practical steps. Over the last decade, his party members have been some of the most vocal opponents to allowing Diaspora Jews to pray the way they want at the Western Wall, to convert to Judaism the way they want and to simply believe in what they want. If we really do ""stand together,"" then there are significant changes that Israel needs to make to the way it treats Jews who do not fit into the Orthodox way of life.
This war has shown us that no matter where a Jew lives, their identity and feeling of safety is connected to the State of Israel. That brings with it a responsibility that Israel cannot ignore.
***
Tuesday marked a month from the Hamas invasion on October 7 and I spent it moving between two very different experiences. In the morning, I watched as our daughter, who has been in the IDF for the last 18 months, graduated from Bahad 1, the IDF Officer Training Academy and became an officer.
In the afternoon, I went to Kibbutz Nir Oz along the border with Gaza and walked between the burned and bullet-ridden homes to see up-close what had happened there a month earlier.
Nir Oz was attacked like the rest of the borderline communities and while the death toll was lower than Be'eri as an example, more than 70 of the 240 hostages are from Nir Oz. The reason was because of Nir Oz's proximity to Gaza but also the fact that there are roads that cut through the field and connect Gaza directly to the Kibbutz making it easy for Hamas to drive straight there with pickup trucks and load up hostages.
The sequence of events - watching my daughter become an IDF officer and then visiting Nir Oz, makes it clear what this country is about and what it is fighting for.
When the hundreds of soldiers stood on the parade ground at the Bahad 1 near Mitzpe Ramon and took upon themselves the mantle of command in the IDF, they do not have to wonder what they will be asked to do. This country is at war, and these youth are our inspiration.
As a parent, as an Israeli, and as a Jew I could not be prouder.

It is also about Jewish peoplehood

UNSC turns deaf ear to Israel's call to condemn Hamas 'war crimes'

The United Nations Security Council on Monday failed to heed Israel's call to condemn Hamas's war crimes, after the terrorist group launched a war against Israel, killing more than 700 civilians and soldiers and taking some 100 others hostage.
""This is Israel's 9/11,"" Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan told reporters, adding that ""from now, nothing will be as it was.""
""Hamas's war crimes must be unequivocally condemned,"" he said.
The UN that was established after the Holocaust to enforce the ""Never Again principle"" has persistently failed to call out Hamas for its terrorist activity, he added.
Erdan spoke before the UNSC held a special meeting behind closed doors for consultations on the situation in Israel and as the IDF prepared for a ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. No statement was released after the meeting.
Such a statement was not a priority for Washington at the moment, US Deputy Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told reporters after the meeting.
""What's important now is [that] the international community shows its solidarity with Israel. We have Israel's back fully,"" he said. ""The condemnation of Hamas needs to continue until they end this violent terrorist activity against the Israeli people.""
Wood said all attempts to draw a ""false"" equivalency between the Hamas assault on Israel and IDF actions to ensure security was ""unacceptable.""
United Arab Emirates Ambassador to the UN Lana Nusseibeh said the council also discussed the applicability of international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians.
""The point about proportionate response was also discussed,"" she told reporters. ""But clearly, right now, the focus for Israel is its own security needs and the fact that it has hostages being held in the Gaza Strip that should be released.""
The UNSC gathered as mounting video and evidence was posted on social media, documenting the civilian cost of the attacks, including photographs of grandmothers and small children kidnapped by Hamas.
""These are war crimes - blatant documented war crimes,"" Erdan said.
""As rockets rained down indiscriminately upon Israeli towns and cities, hundreds of Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel and began a barbaric pogrom of unparalleled magnitude,"" he said about the invasion that began around 6 a.m. on Saturday.
""Ruthless terrorists gunned down innocent Israeli civilians in the streets, murdering anything that moved,"" Erdan said. They ""broke into homes, gathered entire families into rooms and shot them point-blank as if they were stomping on insects.""
He held up photos of the dead to underscore his point and compared the killers to Nazis, adding that in some cases, the elderly victims were Holocaust survivors.
""Grandparents and the elderly, among them Holocaust survivors who endured the Nazis, were violently dragged from their homes, this time by Hamas, and taken into Gaza,"" Erdan told reporters.
Palestinian Authority envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour, in his conversation with reporters, focused on Palestinian suffering at Israel's hands and urged the international community not to back an Israeli military campaign in Gaza.
""When Israel now tries to justify yet another assault... no one should say or do anything to encourage it down this path,"" he said. ""We know only too well that the messages about Israel's right to defend itself will be interpreted by Israel as a license to kill, to pursue the very path that led us here.""
There have already been 370 Palestinian fatalities in the last day due to IDF bombings, including entire families killed in their sleep, Mansour said.
""Why is nothing done when those killed are Palestinians?"" he asked.
The international community has to ask itself what an Israeli campaign in Gaza is about, Mansour said.
""If this is about vengeance, then many Palestinians will feel that they have much to avenge,"" he said. ""If this is about peace, then the way to it is not through further entrenching oppression and occupation.""
""You cannot say that nothing justifies killing Israelis and then provide justification for killing Palestinians,"" he added. ""We are not subhuman. We will never accept a rhetoric that denigrates our humanity and... our rights.""
Palestinian statehood is the only path to peace, Mansour said.
""Israel cannot wage a full-scale war on a nation, its people, its land, its holy sites and expect peace in exchange,"" he said. ""One needs to address the root causes of the conflict, and by doing so, we will be addressing its consequences.""
Erdan, in his remarks to reporters, compared Hamas to the international terrorist groups ISIS and al-Qaeda.
""Hamas is a genocidal Islamist Jihadist terror organization,"" he said. ""It is no different than ISIS. It is no different than al-Qaeda. There is no reasoning with genocidal Jihadists,"" whose charter calls for the annihilation of the Jewish states.
Erdan chastised the international community for failing to condemn Hamas in the past and accepting it as a representative for the Palestinian people.
Since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, ""the world has tried to reason with these terrorists,"" he said, adding that billions of dollars in international assistance to rehabilitate Gaza was diverted for terrorist activity.
""Money is fungible,"" he added. ""It enters Gaza and goes straight to building terror tunnels, rocket launchpads, missile manufacturing sites, and other terror infrastructure.""
""Mark my words, Israel may be under attack today,"" Erdan said. ""But this is not only a war on Israel. This is a war on the free world. It is a war on civilization.""
""Israel is at the forefront of the war on terror, and if we do not succeed, the whole world will pay the price,"" he said.

We are at war. Israel, and the Jewish people, are at war with Hamas. The crimes that have been discovered in the South have been worse than anything we could have imagined. Massacres of Jews that we have not seen since the Holocaust.
There can be no ambiguity now. No fence-sitting. We cannot adjust our language to make the world around us feel more comfortable. We must be honest about who and what we are. Jews originate from Israel; it is our indigenous land. The State of Israel represents the modern Jewish state, the only one in the world. It is our home.
Some Jews feel uncomfortable with the idea that we are as connected to one another, and to Israel, than to the countries of our birth. But now, during this dark time, we must set this discomfort aside. We must embrace our responsibility to one another, to our homeland, and to the continuation of the Jewish people. All Jews are responsible for one another.
We must acknowledge and respect our uniqueness, our indigenousness, and our Jewish identity. It is irrelevant that I was born in the UK; I am a son of Israel. My home and my brothers and sisters, including my actual brother and sister and their families, are under attack. Jews everywhere must answer the call and come to their aid.
There can be no ambiguity about our loyalty. We must be loyal to Israel. This does not mean we are disloyal to the countries of our birth, but we are loyal to our homeland. We must defend our land because it is our land. It is where our civilization began and developed. It is where Jews in exile were, and are, rooted and desperately yearned to return to. Israel and its civilization have been the binding glue that held the Jewish people together in exile.
We will not apologize for reclaiming our indigenous home. We will not apologize for building a modern, powerful nation on the ruins of our ancient civilization. We will not apologize for surviving. That is what we do. We survive and we thrive.
We will proudly wear our Zionism as a badge of honor. There will be no ambiguity about it, no need to qualify it in an attempt to be perceived as palatable by our non-Jewish neighbors. We don't care what they think. We are Jews, we are Zionists, and we love Israel - our home. We will support it with words, with money, and with our hearts.
We will answer the call. With Jewish pride. With Zionism.
There will come a time for mourning. For processing. For undoing the trauma that has - yet again - been inflicted upon us by our enemies. But now is the time for action. We must actively support Israel and her war effort. We will give Israel everything we have, which is less than it deserves.
We are at war. This is not a war we wanted. Nor is it one we started. But we will not ignore it. We will not pretend this existential threat isn't real. We will fight with whatever resources we have at our availability. And this goes for Jews in the Diaspora too. We must fight. With our words. Our wallets and our hearts. Whatever we can fight with, we must fight.
The Jews are an extraordinary people. We are the most continuously persecuted minority in the history of humanity, and yet here we are in 2023 still fighting. We are not - as our enemies would hope - weak or powerless. In fact, we never have been. We survive to this day because of our strength. Because of our resilience. Our perseverance. And most importantly, our undying commitment to our Jewishness and to Israel.
We are the descendants of the Maccabees, the Bar-Kochba revolutionaries, the Warsaw Ghetto uprisers, the sons and daughters of 1948 and 1967. And so many more. Their bravery and courage live on in us today.
What is happening in Israel is unprecedented. It must shake us to our core. And it must lead us to strengthen and reinforce our commitment to her and to the Jewish people.
There is no time for ambiguity. There is Israel. There is Jewishness. And there is the fight to protect both.
Am Yisrael Chai. Long live the people of Israel - always.

Femicide is the killing of women because of their gender. Until this week, I had never realized how pertinent the book I had recently published titled Femicide in War and Peace (Routledge, 2023) could be.
It is an edited volume that addresses for the first time the heinous phenomenon of femicide in conflict and in peacetime, and the thin dividing line between the two. It was prompted by the Ukrainian war, and although I refer briefly to Israel, the book is unique in that contains reports of femicide in places one would least expect, and which hitherto never reported that women have been killed just because they are women.
The volume draws upon cases from what is today called ""the Global South,"" as well as material from Western countries, to give a detailed view of crimes against women and how femicide is perceived in different countries. There are chapters on violations of human rights with respect to women in Rwanda, Zimbabwe, and the North Caucasus, as well as in the United States (""Black Women's Lives Matter""), and Kosovo.
Of course, I mentioned the increasing violence in the Arab sector in Israel and the concomitant rise in femicides and those dishonorable ""honor killings,"" when a family member sees fit to murder their own mother, sister, or daughter in order to retrieve the ""honor"" of his family. Until today, the violence against Israeli women and their murder was not part of my mandate.
Now it is. Last week, Hamas initiated a cruel and barbaric war against Israel. At the time of this writing, the Foreign Ministry has stated that to date more than 1,300 Israeli civilians have been slaughtered, including 258 soldiers. Thousands have been injured. The statistics are still not accurate, since not all the victims have been found or identified. In addition, there are 126 confirmed hostages, but this figure may be substantially higher.
WHAT MAKES this war different from all other previous wars in Israel during the past 75 years of the state's existence? The salience of women, who hardly featured in any other catastrophic previous war. In the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago, to which this war has been compared, women largely served on the home front; 2,600 soldiers died and hundreds became war widows.
In this war, women were at the center of the action. They were innocent wives, partners, and mothers. Women soldiers serving as observers were shot or kidnapped. Women on kibbutzim and agricultural settlements were murdered and burned. Mothers were torn from their children and abducted. Children were dragged off into captivity with or without their family members.
Of the 260 or so corpses from the fated music festival at Kibbutz Reim, where young people were enjoying a party in nature, more than half were female.
The treatment of these women at the hands of the evil Hamas terrorists did not befit any human society. They took delight in raping some of the women, as part of their war effort. They butchered women in front of their children. They abducted women with callousness that has rarely been seen in the Western world, and spat on the naked, lifeless body of one young female blogger from Germany, who had danced freely at the party in the nature just hours before.
EIGE IS the European Institute for Gender Equality, with whom I have collaborated in the past on femicide, despite the fact that they do not include Israel as a member country (even though Israel is recognized as a collaborating country by the European Union). They have a wonderful slogan: Femicide: Name it, count it, end it! We have no data on the extent of femicide among the Hamas during so-called peacetime, and data on femicide in Gaza are few and far between.
I have an out-of-date report from 2016 on ""Murder of women crimes in Palestine"" in which 11 femicides were reported in Gaza in 2014 and six in 2015. The data is very sketchy indeed and there is no attempt at delineating various types of murder. It is known that there are fewer femicides in society as egalitarianism increases. The Hamas is clearly a patriarchal and misogynistic group of terrorists.
Violence against women happens in many forms - from emotional, psychological, and financial abuse, barriers to personal autonomy and security, to physical and sexual abuse culminating in murder. It includes infanticide, sex selection, misogynistic laws and cultural practices, and can include genital mutilation, forced sterilization, or forced pregnancy.
Women experience these forms of violence during peacetime, as well as in times of crisis, conflict, or national insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in violence against women as women globally.
But this war on women by Hamas within the confines of Israel is different. It has outraged a whole society and left morally aligned people the world over horrified. Social media is full of stories of brave women protecting children, or being abducted by the barbaric Hamas terrorists to an unknown location in Gaza.
The Israeli government has proven inept on so many fronts before and during this war. But one item stands out for me more than any other: no government member has spoken out specifically about the plight of women.
It is inconceivable that there is a ministry for the advancement of the status of women, and a female minister (May Golan) - one of the very few - who calls for the destruction of Gaza's infrastructures, but makes no meaningful statement on those valiant women.
In a ""normal"" situation, perhaps the wife of the prime minister would take up the cudgels. I am also waiting for statements from feminist NGOs the world over, including EIGE, to deplore the situation.
Out there, where things become misconstrued in days, some may argue that women in Gaza are also helpless and are being killed. They are, and it is terrible. Global femicide rates are on the rise. But Israeli troops are not raping women and girls, they are not burning women alive, they are not kidnapping babies or beheading them, and they are not executing women in front of their children.

Israel amplifies crackdown in West Bank, targets Hamas amid Gaza war. Palestinian Health Ministry cites over 120 fatalities since October 7

The Israeli army has been ramping up its raids across the West Bank as war in the Gaza Strip rages.
The Palestinian Health Ministry reported at least 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since the Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent war on Gaza.
Israel says it has carried out airstrikes against armed Palestinians clashing with its forces in the Jenin refugee camp, while aggressively rounding up Hamas members.
""Former parliamentarians and Hamas leaders were among the detainees,"" the Palestinian Prisoners Society told The Media Line.
Qadura Fares, chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, said that around 1,600 Palestinians have been detained by the Israeli army in the West Bank.
Israel intensified its West Bank raids in parallel with its war against Hamas in Gaza, and its nightly incursions are seen as an attempt to quell any outbreak of violence in the West Bank.
""A large part of what Israel is doing is retaliatory in the West Bank. It wants to take revenge on Hamas, inflict the biggest blow on Hamas, hurt Hamas, and also ensure that there is no role for Hamas in the occupied West Bank,"" Ramallah-based political analyst Esmat Mansour told The Media Line.
Mansour says Israel's iron fist approach in the West Bank is ""part of its policy to take out Hamas.""
Hamas's presence is limited in the West Bank, where the rival Fatah movement holds power, but the armed Islamist group's actions are widely popular among Palestinians.
IDF Brig.-Gen. (res.) Yossi Kuperwasser, director of national security and Middle East affairs at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, told The Media Line that Hamas is present in the West Bank and the army is taking preemptive measures to stop anyone from taking steps to further inflame the situation.
""There should be a state of precaution to make sure that Hamas doesn't try to carry out attacks from the West Bank. They may consider carrying out attacks if they are cornered in the Gaza Strip,"" says Kuperwasser.
Part of the reason behind the mass arrests, Kuperwasser explains, is to round up Hamas activists to prevent them from organizing demonstrations in support of Gaza.
""We wish for the situation in the West Bank to remain as calm as much as possible to prevent demonstrations and other acts that may hamper the stability of the area,"" says Kuperwasser.
The Palestinian Authority is also relatively quiet: Aside from two speeches by President Mahmoud Abbas, hardly any top PA officials have given public statements on the war in Gaza.
""Israel doesn't have enough faith in the Palestinian Authority. There's a lack of confidence in the PA security services based on their performance. The PA isn't strong enough to stop these demonstrations led by Hamas,"" says Kuperwasser.
The West Bank did not witness an immediate escalation in violence after Israel declared war on Hamas, but Palestinians say if the army and settlers' attacks persist, things will change.
""Israel takes advantage of international support and sympathy and uses it as a cover to purge the West Bank of the largest number of ... fighters and reach them in an attempt to remove the West Bank from the equation of opening a front that distracts Israel from Gaza,"" says Mansour.
""We have to take matters into our own hands; only we can protect ourselves from the occupation forces,"" Abu Khaled, a resident of the Jenin camp, told The Media Line.
The arrests have been executed under Israel's expanded ""anti-terrorism"" law, according to a statement from Addameer, another Palestinian prisoners' rights organization.
""Activists, lawyers, nurses, doctors, and artists"" are among those arrested over the past two weeks, according to the group. Several lawmakers have also been arrested, including Aziz Dweik, the former speaker of the Palestinian parliament and a member of the political wing of Hamas.
Even before the latest violence, 2023 had been the deadliest year for West Bank Palestinians in two decades.
In July, the army carried out its biggest raid in years on the Jenin camp, a West Bank stronghold for armed Palestinian groups, in which 13 Palestinians, including both armed combatants and children, were killed.
One IDF soldier died by Israeli fire during the raid ""following an incident of mistaken identification,"" the army said.

Funding Hamas

One of the many questions arising in the wake of the October 7 Hamas terror attack on southern Israel is the sources of the organization's funding for its military buildup and control over the Gaza Strip. Qatar is the answer that immediately comes to mind, but the data point to a more complex and disturbing answer.
The Gaza Strip is one of the poorest places in the world, but the Hamas regime in Gaza is quite rich. Since taking power in 2007, it has developed five funding channels: four of them operate under arrangements to which Israel is a party or are subject to its supervision.
Combined, these channels generate $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year for Hamas. This is a huge sum compared to the size of Gaza's economy. By comparison, the Palestinian Authority (PA) budget, net of the sums transferred to the Gaza Strip, is slightly more than $3 billion a year. Some of the funds from these five channels are used to finance civilian public services, and the rest to fill the Hamas arsenals.
The PA budget is the most important and largest despite the fact that Hamas violently expelled the PA from Gaza in 2007. Its annual scope is estimated at more than $1 billion. These sums are transferred through the banking system supervised by Israel. They pay the salaries and pension contributions for 40,000 Gaza government employees as well as covering some civilian expenses. The PA also pays for Gaza's water, power and medical services, transferring millions of dollars a year to Israel, which provides the services.
Qatar is the second funding source. The Qatari aid was previously delivered through Israel in suitcases bulging with cash. Today it is transferred through banks under UN supervision and with Israel's approval. Its total scope is estimated at $400 million annually. This money finances welfare payments, part of the salaries of Hamas civilian and military wing employees, and civilian expenses, such as fuel for the Gaza power plant. This money, as far as is known, is hardly used for military procurement.
Customs duties and taxes collected by Hamas provide additional revenue sources. These include high customs duties and taxes on imports from Egypt brought in through the Rafah crossing, as well as ""taxes"" imposed by Hamas on smugglers of goods. In the past, these smugglers operated through tunnels on the Gaza Strip's border with Egypt.
AFTER THE Egyptians destroyed the tunnels, smuggling continues through various ways, though at a smaller scale. A significant part of goods imported via the Rafah crossing are items with a high ""tax component"" (fuels, cigarettes, etc.). All these taxes go to Hamas, as it has absolute control over this route.
Hamas also imposes import taxes, fees, and various payments on imports from Israel that enter Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing. Combined, these two channels of ""tax revenue"" constitute the second largest component of the Hamas regime funding - about half a billion dollars a year.
All these ""taxes and customs"" are illegal under international customs regulation as well as the Paris Protocol (signed between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, aka the PLO, on 29 April 1994, and incorporated with minor amendments into the Oslo II Accord of September 1995) and other agreements between Israel and the PLO or the PA. They are levied at the expense of taxes and fees that the PA is supposed to collect to cover its own expenses for financing civilian services in Gaza. This unsupervised source pays the salaries of the Hamas military apparatuses, as well as paying for military equipment.
The fifth source is Iranian aid, donations from Hamas supporters and other sources abroad. It is difficult to estimate the extent of these funds, which are transferred in convoluted and roundabout ways. Some of the aid is in the form of military equipment smuggled into Gaza, and some is cash transferred through money changers. These various sources probably amount to several hundred million dollars a year, almost all allocated for military equipment and other military uses.
These estimates indicate that more than two-thirds of the Hamas ""budget"" is channeled through the PA, or at its expense, and its transfer is made possible with Israel's approval or consent. Along with the Qatari aid, this means that almost all Hamas funding is provided with Israel's approval or consent. The only revenue source in which Israel is not involved are the ""taxes"" which Hamas imposes on imports through the Rafah crossing, as well as smuggling from Egypt to Gaza, the extent of which is unknown.
Its effective diversification of funding has provided Hamas with the resources to consolidate its control over Gaza and strengthen its military buildup, severely eroding the population's standard of living.
For example, Gaza's per capita national income, which was almost identical to that of the West Bank prior to the Hamas takeover, has fallen to only one-third of the West Bank's. This figure illustrates the depth of Gaza's economic crisis even before the war, and the abject exploitation of Gaza's population by Hamas. Presumably, the war inflicted by Hamas on Israel will lead to a major humanitarian disaster in Gaza that will require enormous and expensive rehabilitation.
The unfortunate conclusion is that the PA and Israel knowingly contributed to bolstering Hamas in Gaza. Israel's failure, therefore, lies not only in poor intelligence and military preparedness, but also in negligence in tracing where and how the funding was used.

As Israel's war efforts against Hamas and its vast infrastructure continue in Gaza, a couple of elements have become clearer and clearer.
Israeli claims that Hamas has been using Gaza's civilian population as human shields in the most cynical and cruel way have proven to be completely true.
On Monday, IDF Spokesman R.-Adm. Daniel Hagari revealed an underground Hamas command center under Gaza's Rantisi Hospital (named after Hamas leader Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi, who was killed by Israel in an air strike in 2004), which not only contained assault rifles, suicide vests, rocket-propelled grenades, and other weapons but also items - such as baby bottles - that Hamas had presumably held Israeli hostages there.
Hagari said there was evidence and independent separate intelligence that Hamas terrorists had returned directly to the hospital after participating in the massacre on October 7.
He also noted that an IDF robot found additional tunnels equipped with electricity being siphoned off the hospital for use by the terrorists underground.
At the same time, IDF troops have closed in on Gaza's Shifa Hospital - the territory's largest - under which Israel has long said Hamas runs its command and control center.
CNN reported Monday that a US official with knowledge of American intelligence confirmed that Hamas maintains a command node under Shifa and uses fuel intended for it and that its fighters regularly cluster in and around the hospital.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also confirmed Hamas's modus operandi to CNN. ""You can see even from open-source reporting that Hamas does use hospitals, along with a lot of other civilian facilities, for command-and-control, for storing weapons, for housing its fighters. Without getting into this specific hospital or that specific claim, this is Hamas's track record, both historically and in this conflict,"" he said.
US President Joe Biden's call that Israel take ""less intrusive action"" at hospitals across Gaza aside, Sullivan's remarks and others he made on Monday, demonstrate that the US understood Israel was obliged to continue focusing on Gaza hospitals due to Hamas's practices.
The Israeli army is facing ""murderous terrorists who continue to say that their goal is the destruction of the State of Israel,"" Sullivan stated. ""You are dealing with a terrorist organization, Hamas, that takes civilians, hostages, including little children, that uses civilians as human shields, that uses civilian infrastructure - even hospitals, in the most cynical ways possible - as fighting positions, as military operation centers,"" he said.
""Israel has to confront that while at the same time not wanting to go assaulting hospitals in firefights that could put innocent people who are getting life-saving medical care in the crossfire. This is the complexity, this is the burden that the Israel Defense Forces are facing as they conduct their operations,"" he explained.
The other truth that has emerged during the war is the scope of what Hamas was planning to do to Israel on October 7, and the realization that this war must end the threat the terrorist group poses to Israel and its citizens once and for all.
According to The Washington Post report published this week, Hamas had hoped to push into large Israeli cities and even to the West Bank. Their aim was to provoke a huge Israeli response and launch a regional war.
Those elements, bolstered by Hamas statements made since October 7 that it will continue to launch more murderous strikes against Israel whenever it can, provide more than enough evidence that Israel must continue its morally just battle against the evil force that controls Gaza, and holds hostage not only the 240 people in captivity, but also all the innocent Palestinian residents of the enclave.
Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told reporters on Monday, citing growing international calls for a ceasefire, that Israel has ""two to three weeks"" to complete its war against Hamas.
Israel has made the case that it is fighting this war not just for itself, but for the democracies of the West, as part of the battle against Iran's influence across the globe.
The most productive move the leaders of the free world can take right now is to provide Israel with all the time it needs to finish the job and eradicate Hamas, now and forever.

Even though the emergency cabinet was formed last Wednesday in a better late than never move, there is no guarantee of a united national front. While it is true that most people have put aside political differences as they join forces in both civilian and military aspects of the war, arguments have already surfaced as to how to deal with Hamas and whether Israel Air Force pilots when bombing Gaza should be guided by their moral conscience or simply follow orders and carry out the mission.
There are also arguments as to whether Hamas should be eliminated at the expense of the hostages, or whether a deal should be struck to release Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages.
On top of all this, there are still calls from certain sectors of the public for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign, while other sectors, including those that previously sought to unseat him, have stated that this is not the time, and that first Israel must win the war against Hamas and later deal with political issues.
* NONETHELESS, IT is difficult for some people, especially journalists, to put the blame game on hold. Some have put big ""Netanyahu Resign"" notices on their social media accounts, and others are debating on radio, television, and in newspaper columns who was to blame for the unpreparedness of the army and who was to blame for the delay in forming an emergency cabinet. In the first instance, it is usually the prime minister, and in the second it's his wife, Sara. There have long been stories about her interference in the prime minister's decisions. Both he and she have denied such involvement, but people who have met her and heard her tell a different story. An article in Yediot Aharonot on Thursday stated that some of Israel's top political reporters, who include Ben Caspit, Yair Cherki, Amit Segal, Daphna Liel, and Moriah Asraf Wolberg, who have a myriad of connections, are in accord that it was Sara who caused the delay, despite being told by other journalists that such an idea is absurd.
Various retired senior officers of the IDF have urged journalists to stop speculating, because at a time like this, Israel must speak with one voice. The time for speculation and settling accounts will be after the war, they have said.
* NATIONAL SECURITY Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who was initially against a united but narrow emergency cabinet, has again sparked controversy by stating that every resident of Sderot is entitled to carry a gun. There are certainly pros and cons on this issue when one considers that the Israeli death toll last week might have numbered far fewer fatalities had more people been able to defend themselves. But top brass in the police force are opposed to arming everyone because not everyone is properly trained, and there is also a danger of guns falling into the wrong hands.
* LABOR PARTY leader Merav Michaeli said on Wednesday night that the Labor Party supports anything that will help restore national security and win the war.
But she qualified that by insisting that the emergency cabinet must first deal with ""the most urgent emergency - bringing the hostages home. Now, before their situation worsens and disasters happen. ""
Before any significant military operation, said Michaeli, ""We must ensure the safe return home of the hostages. The families and the general public have their eyes on us and we must not disappoint them.""
Earlier in the day, Michaeli addressed the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats faction of the European Parliament: ""The best way you can help is to put pressure on Hamas to release the kidnapped children. They are not part of this war,"" she told some 100 S&D members from all 27 member states of the European Union.
Michaeli briefed them on the situation in Israel and the position of the State of Israel. She devoted the main part of her remarks to urging members of the European Parliament to help in the return of the Israelis held hostage. ""The most important way you can help is to put pressure on Hamas to release the kidnapped children, who are being held hostage,"" she reiterated, emphasizing again: ""They are not part of this war. Use your connections to help us bring them home as soon as possible.""
Michaeli, the mother of a two-year-old son, is particularly sensitive to the fact that babies and children are among the hostages.
In response to her appeal, many of the MEPs responded by expressing solidarity with Israel and declaring that they are standing steadfastly with Israel in the war against the vile murderous terrorism. A representative from the Spanish Labor Party's sister party spoke of the ""horror and sadness"" at the harsh scenes they are seeing from Israel.
Rovana Plumb, MEP of Romania's PSD Party and vice-president of the S&D faction, chaired the session. ""Difficult times need strong leaders,"" she said. ""You are a strong leader. We stand with you. Count on us to find solutions.""
Michaeli also stated that in her view the terror bases of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip must be destroyed.
The meeting concluded with a standing ovation as a sign of identification with Israel.
* WHEN HE was mayor of Jerusalem, Economy Minister Nir Barkat personally rescued victims of terror attacks and was deeply involved in everything that affected the development and image of the capital. But in his current role, he apparently claims to be involved, but isn't. A Reshet Bet report revealed that following a press release from Barkat's office stating that he had met with the heads of Israel's major food production and distribution companies asking them not to raise prices at this time, it was vigorously denied by the various CEOs, who said that he had not met with them.
* IN A KAN Reshet Bet interview with Arieh Golan, Moshe Greenberg, a farmer from Metulla who lost a brother in the Yom Kippur War and was himself injured and later lost a son in the Second Lebanon War, said he is staying put despite the threat from Hezbollah. If the farmers leave their fields and orchards, he explained, Israel will suffer from a dire food shortage, which could affect morale. Farmers are among the nation's unsung heroes. Greenberg explained his stoicism as being hereditary. His father had fought in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43, and had survived.
* THE SITUATION of the evacuees from the Gaza Strip is eerily reminiscent of those who were evacuated from Gush Katif in Gaza in August 2005. Many promises were made to them with regard to financial grants and housing, but these promises were only partially kept, and in some cases, not at all.
Former Income Tax commissioner Moshe Gavish says that financial grants must immediately be given to evacuees to meet expenses such as food, utilities, and monthly mortgage payments, which have to be made regardless of whether or not their homes were destroyed.
* IT IS natural that tragedy that affects foreign nationals is of interest to media outlets in the countries of those people, and particular attention is paid to their plight or fate as happened to Oriya Ricardo, an American who was murdered on the first day of the war by Hamas. Her mother, Hannie Ricardo,was widely featured in American print and electronic media, having held out hope for four days before she was officially notified. She had been sitting during that period with the mother of Oriya's boyfriend, and the two women had been planning the wedding that will never take place. Oriya's body was found by her boyfriend last Tuesday when he drove to the site of the music festival to look for her phone to see what messages she might have sent.
Similarly, another mother, Diana Kupervaser, had to wait in anguish during days of silence from Israeli authorities before learning that her daughter Shani, who had also been at the music festival, was among the slaughtered.
Others who were identified were also named in American media coverage.
* EVERY DEATH in this horrific war is tragic. Even terrorists are mourned by mothers, wives, siblings, and children. The difference is that Israelis do not believe in wholesale slaughter, and are determined to eliminate Hamas, and not the population of Gaza, whereas Hamas and its cohorts want to wipe Israel and the Jewish people off the map. In an electronic interview in Melbourne, Jeremy Leibler, the president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, was asked to say in one sentence what prevents Israel and the Palestinians from reaching a peace agreement. His reply was that the Palestinians refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist, and that under such circumstances, negotiations cannot take place.
In a newsletter published by the ZFA, the distinction was made between a siege and a blockade - a very important distinction in international law. In defending Israel's blockade vis-a-vis Gaza, Leibler pointed out that Egypt, which also borders Gaza, is not allowing Gazan refugees to flee through Egyptian channels. That in itself says a lot about why Hamas should be destroyed. Its savagery reflects on the whole of the population of Gaza, many of whose members just want to live in peace.

Every month has a certain significance, but in terms of Jewish and Israeli history, October anniversaries have special meaning up to the present day.
David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding prime minister was born in October 1886. That same month and year, the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in New York Harbor. Its pedestal bears lines by Jewish poet and author Emma Lazarus.
In October 1914, Jonas Salk, the Jewish physician who developed a vaccine against polio, was born in New York City.
In October 1917, there was the battle of Beersheba, which led to the Balfour Declaration a few days later.
In October 1927, the first full-length talkie feature film The Jazz Singer opened in New York with Jewish singer and actor Al Jolson in the starring role.
In October 1938, Hitler's occupation of Sudetenland was the prelude to World War II, in which six million Jews were murdered.
A year later, in October 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the theories he, Einstein, had developed could lead to the creation of an atomic bomb by scientists in Nazi Germany. His suggestion that America develop its own bomb led to the secret Manhattan Project.
In October 1940, German troops invaded Romania, seized strategic oil fields, and killed or incarcerated many Jews.
In October 1943, the Island of Corsica became the first French territory in Europe to be free from Nazi control after Free French Troops liberated the city of Bastia.
The Nuremberg War Trials presided over by the International Military Tribunal (IMT), began in October 1945, and a year later, in October 1946, 12 Nazi leaders were sentenced to death, and others to long prison terms.
Many Jews escaping antisemitism and Nazism found sanctuary in China, which in October 1949 became the People's Republic of China.
October 1949, was also the month and year of the birth of Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to become the first Israeli prime minister born after the founding of the state.
In October 1990, East and West Germany were reunited, and relations between Germany and Israel were strengthened.
The Yom Kippur War began and ended in October 1973.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, the first Arab leader to make peace with Israel - who together with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1978 - was assassinated in October 1981.
In October 1986, Palestinian terrorists infiltrated the Italian luxury passenger ship Achille Lauro and threatened to blow it up unless Israel freed 50 Palestinian prisoners. Of the 440 passengers on board, they killed an elderly wheelchair-bound American Jew, Leon Klinghoffer.
In October 1996, Yasser Arafat, chairman of both the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PL0) and the Palestinian Authority (PA) made his first public visit to Israel for talks with then-president Ezer Weizman at the latter's private residence.
In October 2011, Gilad Schalit, an IDF soldier captured by Palestinian militants was returned to Israel after five years in captivity. The price exacted by Hamas for his release was an exchange of 1,027 Palestinian prisoners. Another Israeli soldier Nachshon Wachsman who was abducted by Hamas terrorists in 1994 was killed in a failed rescue operation that same month.
An exchange deal is virtually impossible under the present circumstances.
In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel, and war was declared.
The Jerusalem Post's 50 Influential Jews and 25 Young Visionaries event which had been meticulously planned for this week, was postponed, as was a historic celebration of Taiwan's Independence Day, scheduled to be held in Jerusalem for the first time this week, having previously been held in Tel Aviv. In making the announcement, Abby Lee, the representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, included Taiwan's condemnation of the attack by Hamas, stating that the Taiwanese people and its government stand with the State of Israel.
While China celebrated its Independence Day before the Swords of Iron War broke out, other countries with which Israel has diplomatic ties are celebrating independence or national unity in October, such as Cyprus, Germany, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, South Korea, Austria, Spain, the Czech Republic, Zambia, and Turkey. Not all of them have large-scale receptions, although more than half do. It remains to be seen whether celebrating these milestones in Israel will have to be postponed this year.
The Yom Kippur War, 50 years ago, lasted for 19 days. Hopefully, this war will come to a much sooner end.

Part of what is dizzying about the war with Hamas is how quickly Israel is moving from possibly the greatest military blunder in its history to being almost entirely in the driver's seat.
Put differently, Hamas clobbered Israel in the first quarter of a four-quarter basketball game, but by the end of the game, or maybe even the third quarter, the IDF will have run up the score on Hamas into a rout.
How is this happening?
First, Hamas had an initial ""success,"" at least in a military terror sense, beyond anyone's wildest imagination.
IDF intelligence personnel used to talk about all kinds of worst-case scenarios, and they always included Hamas possibly taking over one village in the Gaza corridor for a few hours or Hezbollah taking over around five villages in the North for a short time. Casualties on the Israeli side were usually estimated in double digits.
And this would only be if Israeli security failed miserably, which most thought was unlikely after billions being invested in a variety of technological border and aerial defenses.
No one in their worst nightmare thought Hamas could take over 22 villages, kill 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, take over the IDF's Gaza front headquarters, and hold on to portions of those villages for 12-48 hours.
Making the mistake that a superior military generally can always prevent an inferior adversary from victory anywhere, Israel could have learned from the Battle of Thermopylae around 2,500 years ago, or once again from basketball.
In the famous US college national basketball tournament known as ""March Madness,"" on any given day, a team from a town that no one has ever heard of which is highly motivated and perfectly coordinated, but which is very inferior in terms of raw talent and basketball power, can upset a team that is full of million-dollar talents destined for the NBA.
The Cinderella team only has to win once against the ""juggernaut"" team to advance in the tournament, and it happens more often than what should make sense statistically - and mostly because the famous team is overconfident, lets its guard down, and the upstart team takes advantage.
This is most of the story of Hamas's horrifying ""victory"" on Saturday.
The IDF underestimated Hamas, viewed it as static, as cowardly and deterred for not jumping into multiple rounds of conflict between Israel and Islamic Jihad, and as quiet and satisfied with short-term incentives.
In sum, the terrorist group lured Israel into complacency by playing the long game.
It also used a wide mix of new tactics all at once, surprising and confusing Israel, by using an unprecedented huge volume of rockets simultaneously with a massive invasion by land, sea, and air.
The motorized gliders that took out the IDF's lookout position was an example of utterly blindsiding the IDF with retro technology customized to exploit IDF weaknesses.
But the ""March Madness"" tournament then starts to differ fundamentally from war in that it is a one-off battle.
Returning to the basketball analogy of the power team and the tiny weaker team, if those same two basketball teams met 10 times, let alone 100 times, the true power team would probably win nine out of 10 or 90 out of 100.
That is where Hamas and the IDF are now and will be even more once the ground invasion commences, as early as the coming days according to Jerusalem Post sources, and probably not later than another week or so.
Motorized hang gliders can blind lookout spots in a very small area for a couple of hours, but they are not an air force. Hamas has no air force.
The IDF has the most powerful air force in the Middle East - by a lot - and one of the most powerful in the world.
In the first hours of the war, Hamas might have suffered losing only a couple hundred of its forces when possibly around 1,000 Israelis were already killed. But there is no question that the number of killed Hamas terrorists, which already exceeded the Israeli number by midweek, will by the end far exceed Israeli casualties.
The air force is killing somewhere between dozens to sometimes many more Hamas terrorists daily, and the IDF is currently losing almost no one as Hamas has almost no one to shoot at. Of course, it has its rockets, but these cause far more terror and disruption of schools and businesses than actual large volumes of death in Israel.
Once the IDF launches its ground invasion of between tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of better trained, better armed soldiers, with tanks, artillery, air support, and an incredible artificial intelligence machine that unites all of the efforts, IDF casualties will go up, but Hamas losses will go up far more.
Right now, Hamas terrorists still have places to hide from the air force. There will be far fewer places to hide once the ground invasion starts.
Undoubtedly, Hamas will achieve some more tactical victories through ambushes and booby traps - it had time to plan for the counter-invasion. But large numbers of its commanders have been killed by air force bombings, so whatever strategy it had in place will only function at best on a block-to-block basis, with little central coordination.
As problematic as it is that Hamas has smuggled a variety of weapons into Gaza during its more than 15-year rule there, it has nothing that can compete with the IDF's heavy weapons, armor, and air power.
So any tactical gains it achieves will be fleeting.
Someone may ambush a dozen soldiers, but then their hideout will be flattened shortly after by an aircraft, drone strike, or tank or artillery shell, or maybe all at once.
Nothing about the fight will be ""fair,"" and Hamas will not have a chance - militarily speaking.
All of that explains how Hamas could start so far ahead and finish too far down.
THE REASON, then, that this piece only describes the IDF as moving into the driver's seat, but not having full control, is that Hamas is not the only player in deciding the fate of Gaza.
Criticism of Israel has already started to grow incrementally as the shock of the barbaric videos and pictures of Hamas's murderous slaughter of civilians on Saturday gets older, and more pictures and videos continue to emerge of collateral harm to Palestinian civilians from IDF airstrikes.
As in past rounds, much of the world will start to shift pressure on Israel to end its invasion, as soon as the wave of media featuring Palestinian suffering becomes the only ongoing and current story, and the IDF will be given little credit for its trying to avoid harming civilians, at the same time that Hamas deliberately targets civilians.
Maybe because of the magnitude of Hamas's terror on Saturday, the pressure will come more gradually, but it will come.
And Israel also is still clueless about how it wants Gaza managed afterward.
""There will be no more Hamas"" is a great slogan, but the government has not put forward any plan for who will run Gaza in its place, and none of the options are good or stable - part of why Israel avoided toppling the terrorist group until now.
All of this means that the IDF's airstrikes and ground invasion will harm Hamas tremendously and possibly even end its control of Gaza, but there may be an ""overtime"" period where Hamas and other terrorist groups use guerrilla warfare to make a comeback in some shape or form.
All of these dynamics mean that no matter how certain the IDF's military win is, whether it can ""win the peace"" and how long it will really fight Hamas remain open questions.

Harvard and Israel's war with Hamas

What's with those Harvard University students when it comes to Israel? In the face of Hamas's murderous attacks in Israel, 33 Harvard University student organizations consider Israel ""entirely responsible"" for the attacks.
These student organizations, among them an affiliate of Amnesty International, blamed the Jewish state in a letter titled ""Joint Statement by Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups on the Situation in Palestine."" This letter was issued at a time when hundreds of Israelis and tourists had been murdered and more than a hundred, including children, were being dragged into Gaza to be held as hostages.
The groups claim Hamas's attack ""did not happen in a vacuum,"" and the Israeli government has forced Palestinians to live in an ""open-air prison for over two decades.""
But this is not the first time that Harvard's students have picked the wrong side to back. In 2014, Harvard University students visiting the Palestinian Authority posed, smiling, at Yasser Arafat's grave. That visit, I wrote in 2014, ""sent a shot of pain through every one of us who has lost a loved one in the terrorist attacks that Arafat and his allies have waged over the years.""
What makes the Harvard students' letter especially appalling is that some of Harvard's own students have been victims of Palestinian terrorism.
Harvard student Etan Bard and his father, Seldon, were murdered by Palestinian terrorists who blew up a TWA flight from Israel in 1974. Harvard alumnus Harold Rosenthal, who had served as an aide to US senators Walter Mondale and Jacob Javits, was murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Istanbul airport attack in 1976. Another Harvard graduate, Dr. Alan Bauer, was severely wounded - as was his then 7-year-old son who was permanently maimed - in a Palestinian suicide bombing in Jerusalem in 2002.
Perhaps these student groups simply feel that they are following in the university's footsteps as it seeks to have relationships with Palestinian universities.
For instance, Harvard's then-president Lawrence Bacow recently paid a friendly visit to Al Quds University, near Jerusalem. According to an Al Quds press release, ""he met some of the students and faculty, who expressed their enthusiasm about collaborating with Harvard on future research and educational projects.""
I wonder if Bacow had a chance to discuss with the students another topic about which they are very enthusiastic - glorifying Palestinian Arab terrorists, including murderers of Americans.
For instance, in 2016, the Al Quds University administration organized a ""chain of readers"" to publicly honor the multiple-murderer Baha Alyan. A few months earlier, Alyan and an accomplice boarded a Jerusalem bus and began attacking passengers. One of those he murdered was a 78-year-old American Jewish civil rights activist from Connecticut, Richard Lakin. Alyan stabbed and shot the defenseless elderly man in his face and chest. More than 2,500 students participated in this celebration of terror.
I ALSO wonder if Bacow had a chance to visit the monument that was erected at Al Quds a few years ago by the student branch of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) terrorist group, a US-designated terrorist group. The campus monument was called the ""Monument to the Martyrs of Al-Quds University."" It features this inscription: ""Beware of natural death; do not die, but amidst the hail of bullets."" It lists the names of university alumni who were killed while carrying out terrorist attacks.
In addition to Al Quds University, Harvard's FXB Center for Health and Human Rights launched its collaborative new course on ""Palestine Social Medicine"" course at Birzeit University despite that institution's long history of glorifying terrorism. Here are just two examples:
A basketball championship game under the auspices of the university's Sports Education Club, to honor Marwan Barghouti, who is serving multiple life sentences in Israel for five murders. The players wore shirts bearing a photo of Barghouti, and the winners received trophies - from Barghouti's wife - featuring text calling for his release from jail.
Students representing the terrorist groups Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were permitted to stage military parades on campus. They marched with facsimiles (hopefully) of bombs and rockets. They held posters featuring the likenesses of the founders of Hamas and the PFLP and waved the official flags of the two terrorist groups.
No American university should be building ties to Palestinian Arab institutions that glorify terrorism. Any relationship gives the Arab university a measure of credibility and prestige that it does not deserve.
Commenting on the letter, former Harvard president and US Treasury secretary Larry Summers wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he was ""sickened"" by it.
""The silence from Harvard's leadership, so far, coupled with a vocal and widely reported student groups' statement blaming Israel solely, has allowed Harvard to appear at best neutral towards acts of terror against the Jewish state of Israel,"" he wrote.
While the outpouring of disgust by Summers and others over the Harvard students' actions is welcome, I'm sure it will not bring an end to Israel-hatred on the campus. Harvard University has a job to do. And I wish they'd get to it.
The writer is president of the Religious Zionists of America (RZA). He is the father of Alisa Flatow, who was murdered in an Iranian-sponsored Palestinian terrorist attack in 1995 and the author of A Father's Story: My Fight for Justice Against Iranian Terror.

Biden condemns Hamas's 'ISIS-like' slaughter of Jews

US President Joe Biden pledged his country's unwavering support to the Jewish state as he condemned Hamas' ISIS like ""slaughtering"" of nearly 1,000 civilians including 14 Americans in an assault against southern Israel on Saturday that sparked a new Gaza war.
""There are moments in this life, when pure unadulterated evil is unleashed on this world,"" Biden said from the White House on Tuesday night.
He spoke as Israel reeled from revelations that Hamas had decapitated babies and burned bodies in the southern border community of Kfar Aza during its assault against that community on Saturday.
""This is what they mean by human tragedy, an atrocity at an unprecedented scale, he said. ""It brings to mind the worse rampages of ISIS.. sadly for the Jewish people it's not new. This attack has brought to the surface painful memories, scars left by a millennium of antisemitism and genocide of the Jewish people,"" he added.
""In this moment,"" he said, ""we must be crystal clear, we stand with Israel.""
There is no excuse for Hamas' killing, he said, explaining that Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self-determination, he said. ""Its stated purpose is the annihilation of the state of Israel and the murder of the Jewish people,"" he said.
Biden said he had spoken to Netanyahu, his third such conversation since Saturday, and promised that the US would do everything it could to assist Israel including sending ammunition and Iron Dome interceptors.
He warned Israel's enemies, who might be thinking of taking advantage of the situation, ""I have one word, don't.
Congress will be asked to provide funds to Israel and intelligence teams will work with Israel to help retrieve the hostages, he said. Americans are believed to be among the more than 100 people kidnapped by Hamas.
""I have no higher priority than the safety of American hostages,"" Biden said.
The Department of Homeland Security and Federal agencies are working with state and local law enforcement forces to take steps to protect Jewish communities in the US, he said.
Israel pounded the Gaza Strip on Tuesday with the fiercest air strikes in its 75-year-old conflict with the Palestinians, razing whole districts to dust despite a threat from Hamas militants to execute a captive for each home hit. Its estimated that Hamas has over 100 captives, including seniors and children.
Israel's embassy in Washington said the death toll from Hamas' weekend attacks had surpassed all modern Islamist attacks on the West since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
The Biden administration has been particularly concerned that the Hamas war against Israel that began on Saturday will turn into a multi-front regional war, a fear that appeared to be on its way to reality as Israel also faced attacks on its northern border from Hezbollah. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are Iranian proxy groups.
The US has already announced that it plans to move an aircraft carrier close to Israel and expand its fleet of jets in the region. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the US was weighing deployment of a second carrier near the Jewish State.
""Planes have already taken off,"" the US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to Pentagon reporters.
""We are surging support to Israel... We remain in constant ongoing contact with our counterparts in Israel to determine and then support their most urgent requirements.""
The United States does not plan to put American military forces on the ground, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Israel has called up an unprecedented 300,000 of its own reservists. It is, however, looking to fulfill Israeli requests for equipment and funding.
US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown Jr. spoke on Monday with the Chief of the Israeli General Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzl Halevi, the Pentagon said, adding they discussed Hamas' attack and steps to strengthen US military posture in the region.
Brown warned Iran not to get involved in the crisis in Israel and said he did not want the conflict to broaden.
Asked what his message for Iran was, Brown said: ""Not to get involved.""
""We want to send a pretty strong message. We do not want this to broaden and the idea is for Iran to get that message loud and clear,"" Brown told a small group of reporters traveling with him to Brussels.
The official also appeared to dismiss concerns that the United States might struggle to supply Israel at the same time that it funnels weaponry to Ukraine.
""We are able to continue our support both to Ukraine, to Israel, and maintain our own global readiness,"" the official said.
The leaders of the US, Germany, Britain, France and Italy issued a joint statement on Monday condemning the attacks on Israel by the Hamas terrorist group and expressed their ""steadfast and united support"" for Israel.
""Over the coming days, we will remain united and coordinated, together as allies, and as common friends of Israel, to ensure Israel is able to defend itself, and to ultimately set the conditions for a peaceful and integrated Middle East region,"" said the statement by Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.

HAMAS WARNS_ 'We'll start executing Israeli captives.' Diplomatic flurry to secure release amid repo,"

HAMAS WARNS: 'We'll start executing Israeli captives.' Diplomatic flurry to secure release amid reports of a deal

Hamas warned that it would start executing hostages unless Israel stopped bombing Palestinian homes in Gaza without advance notice, amid an intense flurry of diplomatic activity to free the group of 100 Israeli and foreign captives which includes seniors and small children.
Hamas armed wing spokesman Abu Obaida said they have been acting in accordance with Islamic instructions by keeping the Israeli captives safe and sound, blaming the intended move on Israel's stepped-up bombing and killing of civilians inside their homes in airstrikes without warning them.
The warning came as Israel prepared for a ground war in Gaza, Hamas continued to fire rockets at Israel, land battles between militants and the IDF continued in the South and violence broke out with Hezbollah and other terror groups along Israel's northern border.
The war, which the IDF has dubbed Operation Swords of Iron began on Saturday morning after Hamas assaulted the Southern border communities, killing over 900 people starting on Saturday morning.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday night: ""We are fighting for our home. We are in an existential war that we will win,"" he said.
""We always knew who Hamas was, now the whole world knows, Hamas is ISIS - and we will defeat it just as the civilized world defeated ISIS. This bitter enemy wanted war - and he will get war,"" he said.
Netanyahu said he has embarked on a series of steps such as restoring calm to the south, stopping infiltrations, striking at terror targets on Israel's borders, seeking broad international support and reunifying the nation. He also called for a broad national emergency government.
Israel planned to continue to strike at Hamas targets, Netanyahu said, as he thanked global leaders for their support, particularly US President Joe Biden.
""We all want immediate results, but this will take time,"" Netanyahu said, warning Hamas that it had been a mistake to attack Israel on Saturday morning.
""Difficult days are ahead,"" he said, adding that ""we are determined to win this war.""
""Hamas will understand that by attacking us, they have made a mistake of historic proportions. We will exact a price that will be remembered by them and Israel's other enemies for decades to come.""
The United States has worked to prevent a multi-front war, with Biden scheduled to speak on the matter with key US allies.
Should those efforts fail, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said his country will send the USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group to the Eastern Mediterranean, closer to Israel. The force includes the nuclear-powered carrier, a guided missile cruiser and four guided missile destroyers.
Austin also said the US had taken steps to augment its Air Force F-35, F-15, F-16, and A-10 fighter aircraft squadrons in the region.
Netanyahu said, ""Our joint enemies .. understand very well the importance of this step.""
Securing the release of the hostages is seen as a first step toward restoring calm, after three days of war. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen confirmed that there were more than 100 hostages held in Gaza and the US has said that some of them are American citizens.
Coordinator for the Captives and Missing Brig.-Gen. (Ret.) Gal Hirsch, who was appointed to the task only on Sunday, said, ""We are engaged in formulating a full assessment of the situation and are acting with full force to create an effective mechanism, an address for all families that are anxious for the fate of their loved ones.
""We are in the midst of a difficult war; the fighting is continuing and will continue,"" Hirsch said.
""The storm is great and the heart is in great pain, very much so. Difficult missions are yet before us, and I am with you, in the campaign to bring the captives and the missing back home to Israel.""
Israeli media reported on Monday night a humanitarian agreement had been reached for the release of the children and the elderly but that no agreement had been reached on the matter.
A senior Israeli source rejected reports of negotiations, despite stories of Egyptian, Qatari and Turkish efforts.
Qatari mediators have held urgent calls to try to negotiate freedom for Israeli women and children held in Gaza in exchange for the release of 36 Palestinian women and children from Israel's prisons, a source briefed on the talks told Reuters.
Qatar's foreign ministry confirmed to Reuters its involvement in mediation talks with Hamas and Israeli officials, including over a possible prisoner swap.
The ongoing negotiations, which Qatar has been conducting in coordination with the US since Saturday night, are ""moving positively"" said the source, who has been briefed on them.
""We are in constant contact with all sides at the moment. Our priorities are to end the bloodshed, release the prisoners and make sure the conflict is contained with no regional spillover,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari told Reuters, without elaborating.
A Palestinian official, familiar with mediation efforts with Hamas and Israel in the past, told Reuters that Qatar and Egypt have been in contact with the group but the intensity of the fighting cast shadows over any potential breakthrough.
Egypt has been in close contact with Israel and Hamas to try to prevent further escalation in fighting between them and to ensure the protection of the Israeli hostages, two Egyptian security sources said.
Egypt had urged Israel to exercise restraint and Hamas to hold its captives in good condition to keep open the possibility of de-escalation soon, the Egyptian sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Asked about Washington's coordination with Qatar on a potential swap, the US State Department referenced a Saturday phone call between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Qatar's Prime Minister in which the two agreed to ""remain closely coordinated.""
A senior Hamas official said the group is open to discussions over a possible truce with Israel, having ""achieved its targets.""
Moussa Abu Marzouk told Al Jazeera in a phone interview that Hamas was open to ""something of that sort"" and ""all political dialogs"" when asked whether the Islamist group is willing to discuss a possible ceasefire.
Israel continued to receive global support for its war with Hamas, although some diplomats warned against a disproportionate response and frowned on a possible ground campaign.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned ""the abhorrent attacks by Hamas and others against Israeli towns and villages in the Gaza periphery.
""I recognize the legitimate grievances of the Palestinian people. But nothing can justify these acts of terror and the killing, maiming and abduction of civilians.
""I reiterate my call to immediately cease these attacks and release all hostages,"" Guterres said.
Still, he said, he was alarmed by the high casualty count from Israeli strike against Hamas in Gaza. There are ""alarmed by reports of over 500 Palestinians - including women and children - killed in Gaza and over 3,000 injured.
""While I recognize Israel's legitimate security concerns, I also remind Israel that military operations must be conducted in strict accordance with international humanitarian law,"" he said.
He also took issue with Israel's announcement that it was cutting electricity, fuel and water to Gaza, as well as preventing goods from exiting and entering the Strip, including food.
""The humanitarian situation in Gaza was extremely dire before these hostilities; now it will only deteriorate exponentially,"" he said.

Hamas hasn't yet given up on 'unity of the battlefields',"

Hamas hasn't yet given up on 'unity of the battlefields'

Thursday's escalation along the border between Israel and Lebanon has revived Hamas's hope of fulfilling its vision of the ""unity of the battlefields,"" which aims to trigger a multi-front confrontation with Israel.
Both Hamas and Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the firing of dozens of rockets at Israeli army bases and communities. Hamas is desperate to drag Hezbollah into the war.
Hezbollah, for its part, is seeking to send a message to Hamas that the Lebanon-based group has not abandoned its Palestinian allies and is ready to join the war.
According to the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Akhbar newspaper, an operation room involving all members of the ""axis of resistance,"" including Hamas and Hezbollah, has been set up to coordinate military activities in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.
The increased tensions in northern Israel came less than 48 hours after Hamas leaders expressed concern over the failure of Iran and its proxies, including Hezbollah, to join the fight against Israel. Despite the concern, Hamas has still not given up its hope that Hezbollah would ultimately join the war.
In the past few years, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have been promoting the idea of ""wihdet al-sahat"" (unity of the battlefields), which envisions other parties joining the fighting during another war with Israel. In addition to Hezbollah, these parties include Iran, the West Bank, east Jerusalem, Arab Israelis, the Yemen-based Houthis, and Syria.
In 2022, PIJ named its three-day military confrontation with Israel as the ""Battle of the Unity of the Battlefields."" That confrontation erupted after Israeli security forces arrested Bassam al-Sa'adi, a senior PIJ activist from Jenin.
Yet the name PIJ chose for the confrontation did not match the reality on the ground as the group was left to fight alone while Hamas was sitting on the fence. Hamas also chose not to get involved in last May's Israel-PIJ confrontation, which erupted after Israel killed three military commanders of PIJ.
Prior to the October 7 Hamas assault on Israel, leaders of the group seemed confident that the ""axis of resistance"" would immediately attack Israel once a war erupts in the Gaza Strip.
Judging from the statements of the Hamas leaders, they were also pinning high hopes on the ""armed resistance"" in the West Bank. The past two years have seen the emergence of a number of armed groups in the West Bank that are affiliated with Hamas and PIJ. These groups include the Jenin Battalion and the Lions' Den. These leaders were also hoping that many Arab Israelis would take to the streets and engage in violent attacks against Israelis, as was the case in 2021.
The clashes that erupted along the Israel-Lebanon border over the past two weeks have been welcomed by Hamas as a sign that the ""unity of the battlefields"" is finally happening. However, some Hamas leaders did not conceal their disappointment over Hezbollah's failure to launch a major attack on Israel.
Hamas officials Khaled Mashaal and Musa Abu Marzouk have been quoted as expressing disappointment with the failure of the ""axis of resistance"" to join the fight against Israel.
""The reaction of the axis of resistance to the event [the Israel-Hamas war] is disappointing,"" said Abu Marzouk.
""The steps of Hezbollah, Iran, and Syria are insufficient,"" complained Mashaal. ""History is not made with timid and hesitant steps.""
This criticism has also been reflected in comments made by some Palestinians and Arabs who have been mocking Hamas for believing the belligerent statements, threats, and promises of Iranian and Hezbollah leaders. This criticism may also be behind Hezbollah's increased involvement in the rocket attacks from Lebanon.
""[Syrian President Bashar] Assad, Iran, and Hezbollah have cracked our heads with lies,"" remarked Nedal al-Amari, who describes himself as ""an independent journalist working for the Syrian revolution.""
He added: ""Why are they hiding like mice from Israeli airstrikes? Because they are busy bombing civilians in Idlib and its countryside. Most of Assad's forces - Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah - are present in northern Syria to kill innocent civilians.""
Saudi petroleum engineer Dr. Mansour al-Malik also scoffed at the prospect that Iran and Hezbollah would come to Hamas's rescue. ""Iran sold Gaza, Hamas, [Palestinian] Islamic Jihad, and the resistance in return for the safety of the mullah's regime,"" al-Malik wrote.
Voicing concern that Israel would target Lebanon in retaliation for a Hezbollah attack, several Lebanese citizens have recently been warning that ""the unity of Lebanon is more important than the 'unity of the battlefields.'"" Their message to Hezbollah: Lebanon doesn't want to be dragged into the Israel-Hamas war.
A senior Palestinian Authority official in Ramallah, who requested anonymity, said Hamas leaders are beginning to realize that they have been left to confront Israel alone. The tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border have still not escalated into an all-out war, the Palestinians in the West Bank have not launched a new intifada, and most of the Arab Israelis are sitting on the fence, the official noted.
He cautioned, nonetheless, that the situation could change after an Israeli ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.
""A lot depends on what happens once the Israeli army enters the Gaza Strip,"" the official said.

For Israel, this is not a war of revenge. This is not a war of retaliation. This is not tit for tat nor a cycle of violence.
For Israel, this is a defensive response.
Israel's advance into Gaza is part of the Jewish state's larger mission of self-defense.
Know this. Remember this. This difference is foundational in understanding Israel's actions and behaviors.
Israel's citizens were savagely attacked and it has the responsibility to protect its citizens. Understanding the international laws of self-defense is essential. Interestingly, these laws coincide with Jewish tradition and Jewish law on the issue of self-defense.
However, because Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza, it will be attacked by international media and by Jew haters for its purely defensive actions against Hamas. Many of those media attacks will be baseless, perpetrated by those do not understand the meaning of self-defense.
Self-defense does not simply mean that when attacked, you are permitted to fight back. It means much more.
International self-defense laws permit a country to cross a border into another country to pursue the enemy that has attacked them.
Self-defense includes cross-border preemptive strikes. It is not about who throws the first punch - especially if there is a proof of a plan to attack, as testified to by Hamas documents that have been discovered.
Think back to the Six Day War. Although Israel was the first to strike, it struck in a defensive preemptive attack against its enemies' air-forces.
The Talmud, in Tractate Sanhedrin, echoes this exact sentiment. When someone comes to attack you - you must rise in advance and attack them first. The Gemara actually uses the term ""comes to kill you."" A direct translation of the sentence would be ""When he comes to kill you, rise and kill him.""
This is the rabbinic version of a preemptive strike.
Part of our current strike in self defense is for Israel to hit Hamas hard enough that it will not attack us again. And that is the express purpose of Israel's War of Iron Swords and the IDF's actions against Hamas in Gaza.
Over the next few weeks, enemies of Israel and Jew haters are going to use the media to attack Israel.
THEY WILL be using terms like ""disproportionate force"" vs ""proportionate force"" and ""excessive force"" vs ""commensurate force.""
And yet, I can - without hesitation - guarantee that those saying Israel uses excessive disproportionate force will be wrong.
Disproportionate force is not the Israeli way. And proportionate force is not a literary term. It does not mean that if the attackers throw rocks at you, your only response can be to throw rocks back at them. It does not mean that if the attackers used machine guns you cannot use planes.
Disproportionate force means that the attackers did not satisfy certain conditions while attacking: The central condition is whether they reasonably attempted to avoid civilian casualties when attacking their targets and whether their targets were responsible for any previous attacks.
Israel adds conditions of its own when targeting terrorists in urban environments.
As the entire world knows by now, Israel removes the element of surprise by dropping warning leaflets in Arabic telling locals to leave and sending texts in Arabic to the cell phones of civilians in Gaza, as well as ""roof knocking,"" dropping non-explosive devices on the roofs of civilian homes to warn them. It is a practice that the IDF initiated years ago.
HAMAS, MEANWHILE, tells their citizens to stay put and even threatens them should they decide to vacate. This is of the many ways in which Hamas turns average Gazans into their human shields.
Israel targets those responsible for past attacks and that have acknowledged that they are actively planning future attacks. In this vein, Israel's declaration of war against Hamas is its effort to prevent future attacks against its citizens and its territory by Hamas.
That is what we call a defensive war, that is why Israel's War of Iron Swords is a defensive war.
Looking at it in any other way, the operation becomes immoral and unjust, and that is how Israel's enemies and detractors will try to spin Israel's actions.
But Israel's war against Hamas is moral and is just.
IDF rules of fighting are more moral than any other fighting force in the world. It bears repeating that Israel's fighters are not called Israel's ""army,"" nor Israel's ""military."" They are the Israel Defense Forces. It is the only army in the world with that praenomen.
Hamas violently, brutally, savagely, attacked and plans to continue to attack innocent Israeli civilians. The Hamas claim is that there is no such thing as an Israeli civilian, that all Israelis are settlers. The people under attack were living in communities, not settlements.
Hamas cares as little about the truth, as little about international law, as they care about the value of human life. Hamas cares only about Hamas.

The IDF has been conducting targeted operations against Hezbollah terrorist targets in Lebanon. It has reported successful strikes on several Hezbollah targets in the southern region of Lebanon. These targets included an observation post situated near the coastline, from which anti-tank missiles were launched in the direction of Rosh Hanikra last Wednesday.
From one side, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned on Monday evening that Iran's proxies around the Middle East could launch preemptive strikes on Israel ""in the coming hours. Israeli strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon come hours after Iran's foreign minister warned about his country ""taking 'preemptive action.""
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has issued a warning that if Israel's attacks on Gaza persist, the ""Axis of Resistance"" will continue to retaliate. This statement signifies his intention to challenge the United States and Israel. Without a doubt, he has direct involvement in the Hamas attack, and has been given the green light from Russia.
The term ""resistance forces,"" as cited by Ali Khamenei, refers to a transnational network of terrorist criminal groups that the mullah's regime in Iran supports, including Islamic terrorists like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hashd al-Shaabi in Iraq, the Houthis in Yemen, and entities like the Fatemiyoun and Zainbiyoun brigades in Syria. These terrorist groups have received financial and military support from the Iranian regime, and Iran has been perpetuating and extending conflicts in the region.
REMARKABLY, Hamas and Hezbollah are two Islamic terrorist organizations with different origins, goals, and operations, but they share certain similarities and have some connections primarily based on their shared villainy against Israel and similar destructive ideology.
· Ideological and terrorist ties: Both Hamas and Hezbollah are Islamist terrorist organizations that emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a shared goal of attacking Israel and influence in the Middle East. They are both influenced by Shia Islam and share anti-Israel and anti-Western ideologies.
· The anti-Israel stance: Hamas and Hezbollah are united in their opposition to Israel and have engaged in terrorist conflicts with Israel. They both view Israel as a hostile state and seek its elimination.
· Iranian regime's support: Both terrorist organizations receive significant support from Iran's outlaw regime, a Shia theocracy. Iran provides financial, military, and logistical support to both Hamas in Gaza, and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran sees them as important as the terrorist Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in its struggle against Israel and its regional influence efforts.
· Terrorism and operational cooperation: While they operate in different regions (Hamas primarily in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon), they have exchanged military tactics and strategies. They share experience and expertise in guerrilla warfare, rocket attacks, and terrorist activities against Israeli targets.
· Training and funding: Hezbollah, with its well-established military structure and experience, has reportedly provided training and assistance to Hamas in terms of military tactics and organization. Additionally, both groups receive funding and support from IRGC terrorists and the Quds Force in Iran.
· Political alignment: Hamas and Hezbollah share some common ideological goals, including Islamic terrorism against Israel. They cooperate on certain diplomatic and political fronts, especially within the context of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and broader regional dynamics.
It's important to note that while they share some commonalities and receive support from similar sources, they remain terrorist organizations with their own specific objectives and operational areas. Hamas primarily focuses on the Palestinian territories, especially the Gaza Strip, while Hezbollah is based in Lebanon.
· Iran's regional ambitions: Hezbollah and Hamas in a unified front against Israel analysis: Iran's influence in the Middle East has been a subject of global interest and concern for many years. One aspect of this vicious influence is its support for various terrorist organizations, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, both of which share a common goal of opposing Israel.
The possibility of Iran pushing Hezbollah to join forces with Hamas in a war against Israel was crystal clear. The potential implications of such an alliance on the geopolitical landscape of the region should be considered. Iran has long been a supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas, providing them with financial, military, and ideological support.
Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, has a history of terrorist conflict with Israel and is considered a powerful terrorist militia in the region. Hamas, based in the Gaza Strip, has also engaged in numerous terrorist conflicts with Israel and has strong ideological ties with the Iranian mullah's regime.
· Shared objectives and ideological alignment: Iran supports both Hezbollah and Hamas due to their shared objective of opposing Israel and their ideological alignment as Islamist terrorist militant groups. Their common goal of governing Palestinian territories and their terrorist activities against Israel serve as a basis for potential collaboration.
· Military synergy and strategic alliance: Iran may see potential benefits in encouraging Hezbollah to collaborate with Hamas. Hezbollah possesses significant military capabilities and expertise, and joining forces with Hamas could create a more potent and coordinated front against Israel. Such an alliance could amplify their ability to launch coordinated attacks, engage in terrorist guerrilla warfare, and escalate the conflict strategically.
· Regional geostrategic calculations: Iran's interest in promoting a united front against Israel is driven by its desire to establish regional dominance and reduce Israel's influence in the Middle East. Encouraging cooperation between Hezbollah and Hamas allows Iran to further its geopolitical ambitions and strengthen its position as a major player in the region.
· Potential implications of the alliance:
An alliance between Hezbollah and Hamas could lead to a significant escalation of the conflict. The increased military capabilities and strategic coordination could result in more intense and prolonged conflicts, causing human suffering and instability in the region.
Such an alliance could potentially shift the balance of power in the Middle East, challenging the existing geopolitical dynamics and alliances. Israel and its allies may need to reassess their strategies and responses to effectively counter this new collaborative front.
The alliance might also pose challenges to diplomatic efforts and the peace process in the Middle East. The united front against Israel could undermine negotiation initiatives and dialogue, making the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict even more challenging.
In conclusion, while the idea of Hezbollah and Hamas forming a joint alliance against Israel is a possibility, the geopolitical implications of such a collaboration are substantial. Iran's support for these groups and potential encouragement of this alliance underscores the complex and multifaceted dynamics in the Middle East.
Addressing this turbulent situation requires careful consideration of regional dynamics, diplomatic efforts, and an understanding of the shared goals and motivations that drive these terrorist groups and their supporters.
The Tehran regime plays a significant role in perpetuating and extending warfare, acting as a source of turmoil and Islamic terrorism, so that the terrorist-loving mullahs are the source of mayhem and instability. A bunch of criminal mullahs are ruling the civilized nation.

"Antisemitic incidents up 400% in US since Oct. 7, says ADL","

Antisemitic incidents up 400% in US since Oct. 7, says ADL
Jerusalem Post

Body


A nearly 400% surge in antisemitic incidents has been reported across the US following the Hamas massacre on October 7, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Preliminary data from the ADL Center on Extremism reveals that incidents of harassment, vandalism, and assault spiked significantly compared to the same period the previous year.
Between October 7 and 23, 2023, ADL identified 312 incidents. Of these, 190 were directly associated with the conflict in Israel and Gaza. In comparison, only 64 incidents were reported during the same timeframe in 2022, of which four were related to Israel.
Following the October 7 attack, nearly 400 anti-Israel rallies have been tracked by the ADL. Of these rallies, 109 demonstrated explicit or strong implicit support for Hamas or displayed violent intentions towards Jews in Israel. These 109 events are included in the antisemitic incident count.
ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt expressed his concerns: ""When conflict erupts in Israel, antisemitic incidents soon follow in the US and globally. From white supremacists in California to radical anti-Zionists, we are witnessing a troubling surge in antisemitic behavior domestically while conflict intensifies abroad.""
Moreover, the ADL observed a near 1,000-percent surge in violent messages mentioning Jews and Israel on Telegram following the Hamas attack.
Greenblatt urged leaders at all levels to stand firm against antisemitism and terrorism: ""Words matter. We call on those in power to use their platforms to condemn hate and terrorism, no matter where it manifests.""
A top lawyer in the Illinois state government told a Jewish person, ""Hitler should have eradicated all of you."" An Israeli student was assaulted at Columbia University. And Jewish schools and synagogues in at least three different states have been subjected to violent threats.
Those are a few of the incidents that have occurred during the spike in antisemitic activity in the United States since Hamas invaded Israel.
That reported increase in antisemitism has put Jewish communities - and the US government - on guard as the war in Gaza and Israel dominates the headlines, even as Jewish security agencies have not warned of any credible threats of violence. Hillel International is providing new funding for armed guards on college campuses, and other Jewish institutions are also bolstering security. Last week, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department was monitoring an increase in reported threats to Jewish, Muslim and Arab communities.
The ADL has tracked 193 incidents it classifies as antisemitic in the period following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, an increase of more than 20% from the same time period last year, although reports of antisemitism are still coming in. Such incidents cover a wide range of activities and do not include participation in pro-Palestinian rallies. But Segal said any incident that ""ascribes blame to the entire Jewish community for what is happening in Israel"" would be counted.
The period after the October 7 invasion has also seen attacks and threats targeting Muslims in the United States, including the murder of a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy in the Chicago area.
Amid all of this, nonprofits focused on Jewish security have, so far, not sounded the alarm. One such organization in New York, the Community Security Initiative, has advised Jewish institutions to ""keep calm and carry on,"" according to The New York Times.
Jewish security agencies also said two weeks ago they were not aware of any credible threats ahead connected to a Hamas-inspired ""day of violence"" against Jews worldwide on October 13.
""People are calling the NYPD bomb squad because they got a package from Gaza that turns out it's olive oil,"" said Mitch Silber, director of the Community Security Initiative and a former intelligence official for the New York Police Department. He added that Hamas has no known formal capacity in the United States.
""It feels like pure panic mode the community is in, and part of our job is to do a little anxiety alleviation,"" Silber said.
A spokesperson for the Secure Community Network, a nationwide security organization for Jewish institutions that operates a ""command center"" in Chicago, told JTA it was seeing ""a significant increase in the threat environment for the Jewish community across North America"" since October 7. However, its CEO Michael Masters added in a statement, the group was ""not tracking any active, credible threats at this time.""
In the moments after the murder of a young Detroit synagogue president was reported, rumors swirled that the crime was linked to the Israel-Hamas war. But police say they have not seen any sign of antisemitism so far in their investigation.
Yet, there has indeed been a string of violent incidents and threats against Jews in cities across the US. In New York City, police say a man attacked a Jewish woman, and told her that he was punching her because she was Jewish.
On October 17 in Charlotte, North Carolina, the FBI announced it had arrested a man who had sent a threatening email to an area synagogue in which he vowed ""public execution""; the threat came weeks after a rash of other emailed and phoned threats to synagogues across the country.
That same day, police in Miami Beach, Florida, arrested a homeless man who approached a local Jewish day school security guard, said, ""I'm with Hamas,"" and falsely claimed he was carrying explosives.
Other threats against Jews this month have come from working professionals. A professor at the University of California, Davis, posted online that ""all these zionist journalists who spread propaganda and misinformation"" could be targeted, and concluded the post with machete, ax and bloodrop emojis.
The university's president announced Thursday that the school had placed the professor under investigation, and her name is no longer listed on the faculty page.
And the Illinois comptroller's office fired one of its legal counsels Thursday after the attorney was found to have left threatening comments on the anonymous Instagram page of a lawyer who identified as Jewish, including ""Hitler should have eradicated all of you"" and ""all you Zionists will pay,"" according to reports.
The attorney, Sarah Chowdhury, also served as president of the South Asian Bar Association; the legal group announced it had terminated her as well and apologized ""for any harm"" caused by her remarks.

The growing Houthi threat

The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen are increasing their threats to Israel and the Middle East. On October 18, they launched drones and missiles targeting Israel, which were intercepted by a US warship in the Red Sea. The incident continued for several hours. On October 27, another incident took place in which drones and projectiles landed in Egypt. That day, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, ""Israel condemns the harm caused to Egypt's security forces by the missiles and drones launched by the Houthi terrorist organization with the intention of harming Israel. The Houthis are a proxy of the Ayatollah's terrorist regime in Tehran, which also controls the Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas terrorist organizations.""
The two threats now appear to be part of a growing pattern. Sirens sounded in Eilat on October 31. In this incident, reports said, an aircraft, likely an unmanned one, had caused the sirens. The pro-Iran media Al-Mayadeen said that a drone had threatened Eilat.
The sirens in Eilat came two days after the Houthis said they had formed a joint operations room to confront Israel. The Al-Mayadeen article about the Houthi threats said that the Houthis support a Palestinian state. The official slogan of the Houthis is ""Death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews."" The movement says it wants a Palestinian state over the entire land of Israel, and they do not recognize concepts of two states based on the 1948 War of Independence or the 1967 Six-Day War. As such, the Houthis embrace the concept of ""from the river to the sea.""
The Houthis said over the weekend that ""there are joint operations rooms and efforts that monitor and work to confront any Zionist foolishness if it invades Gaza by land, and we are monitoring the situation closely."" They claim that ""the war in Palestine has become a war against Islam, in which the West and the United States are mobilizing alongside the Zionist enemy."" This is part of the general attempt by Iran to rally proxies in the region to attack the US and Israel. For instance, Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria have carried out 25 attacks on US forces since October 7.
""Two armed drones targeted Iraq's Ain al-Asad airbase, which hosts US forces, but there were no casualties or damage,"" a security source and a government source told Reuters on Tuesday. The use of drones by the Houthis and by Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria is all part of the same Iranian octopus nexus. Iran exports drone technology to these groups. It also exports drones to Russia. The Iranian Shahed 136 first showed up in Yemen in 2001. As such, the Houthis are not only a proxy, but a test bed for Iranian weapons. The Houthis have carried out drone and missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf since 2015. China helped broker Saudi-Iran reconciliation earlier this year, but the Houthis continue to threaten Riyadh from Yemen.
The Houthis are part of the Iranian desire to globalize and regionalize the October 7 massacre by Hamas. In an effort to make this a regional conflict with the US, Iran has used its media to spread claims that the US is involved in Israel's war on Hamas. Turkey has also sought to slam the US and Israel. China and Russia have refused to condemn Hamas. This illustrates that the war is much larger than Israel fighting Hamas. Iran and Russia see it as a way to challenge the US. Russia believes this is about a multi-polar world order; they see the Hamas war as a kind of larger symbolic proxy war against the West.
""THE BATTLE of Al-Aqsa Flood has begun and will destroy everything that the occupation forces and global imperialism have built,"" Houthi official Mashdi al-Mashat said, adding that ""there is no such thing in the Arab region as Israel."" Al-Aqsa ""flood"" is Hamas's name for its October 7 attack. Israel expanded ground operations in Gaza over the last few days, and Hezbollah has increased threats against Israel, as did terrorists in Syria and the Houthis. This is Iran's plan to ""unify"" fronts against Israel.
The Houthi official claimed that ""the West escaped from its problems and wars by exporting the Jews to the Arab world, and created an entity for them outside the topography of the region."" This is typical antisemitic, Iran-backed Houthi rhetoric. Jews have lived in the Middle East for thousands of years, including in Yemen. The Jewish presence in Yemen predates the modern Houthi movement.
The October 18 attack by the Houthis included numerous drones and missiles, some with large warheads. The October 27 attempted attack was thwarted, but the projectiles landed in Egypt, showing the growing Houthi threat to the region. There was also another incident reported by Maariv overnight from October 29 to 30. The October 31 incident is still under review.
Saudi Arabia also put its forces on alert after a recent clash, according to Bloomberg, on October 30. The Saudis have intercepted Houthi missiles in the past. Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman was in Washington on Monday, where he discussed the kingdom's support for a ceasefire in Gaza. According to Arab News, ""on Yemen, Prince Khalid wrote: 'We also discussed the Kingdom's efforts in Yemen to end the crisis and achieve peace.' The White House said: '[Jake] Sullivan welcomed the significant de-escalation of the conflict over the past year and a half and endorsed Saudi-led efforts to bring the war to a close altogether.'""

The Middle East has experienced a year of intense activity. With 2023 drawn to a close, experts reviewing the region's changes agree that the Israel-Hamas war, sparked by Hamas's terrorist massacre on October 7, was the year's most significant event. However, this was not the only significant development.
The region underwent significant changes in various fields last year. The Media Line explored the key geopolitical, economic, and environmental changes in the region in 2023.
Geopolitical and Economic Developments
""I would be hard-pressed to find anything more impactful than Hamas's attack on Israel and the subsequent conflict,"" said Hugo Corden-Lloyd, a UK-based intelligence expert who specializes in Iran. He also noted to The Media Line that the full impact of this event on the region remains to be seen, but it seems to set the stage for various states to either capitalize on or exacerbate the instability.
He emphasized Iran's significant role in this context. ""I believe it has watched the West's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and used it as a benchmark to measure the West's strategic and military redlines, its willingness to become directly involved in a 'hot' war, and the limits of its effectiveness,"" he said, adding that this would dictate the extent to which Iran was willing to support a regional conflict, including the conflict's expansion to Lebanon.
Nadeem Ahmed Moonakal, a research scholar at Rasanah: International Institute for Iranian Studies in Riyadh, noted the Gaza conflict's impact on the global economy. He highlighted the risks at critical maritime chokepoints such as the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, vulnerable to Houthi attacks, as evidenced in 2023.
Moonakal also referenced a major geopolitical event of the past year: the unexpected Saudi-Iran rapprochement deal. This agreement marked a critical point of political reconciliation after years of tension.
He told The Media Line, ""China's role as a mediator in this agreement represented a departure from the traditional dominance of US influence in the region."" He noted an observed trend of increased assertiveness among regional powers, reflecting a broader shift in both regional and global geopolitics.
Moonakal explained that regional powers are aiming to boost their strategic autonomy and adapt to changing geopolitical dynamics. He highlighted the expansion of the intergovernmental organization BRICS as a significant development. ""Welcoming new members such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. BRICS is now perceived as a crucial alternative to Western hegemony,"" he continued.
However, Moran Zaga, a Gulf States researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Mitvim Institute, observed that one of the region's major shifts is the increasing American involvement.
""As Middle Eastern countries are starting to practice regional solutions, the Biden administration in 2023 has taken a step forward in its Middle East policy and influence,"" Zaga told The Media Line. She attributed this primarily to the increasing likelihood of a US-Israel-Saudi deal and the significant risks posed by the Israel-Hamas war.
Zaga maintained that despite the Israel-Hamas war, the overall regional reconciliation observed throughout the year remains intact. She pointed to the flourishing relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia and Syria's reentry into the Arab League.
Nir Levitan, a research fellow at the Europa Institute at Bar-Ilan University, added ongoing negotiations for expanding normalization pacts between Israel and Saudi Arabia, as well as continued security coordination between Israel and moderate Arab states, to the list of key 2023 geopolitical and economic developments.
""This continuity facilitated the United States' efforts to expand its network of allies, incorporating a strategic axis connecting India, Gulf states, Israel, and Europe,"" he told The Media Line.
Levitan believes that this situation is expected to continue even after the multifront conflict between Iran-affiliated groups and Israel.
He observed that the apparent commercial shift is set to broaden the scope of major Eastern markets, establishing stronger connections with Europe through the Gulf nations and Israel's neighboring countries. ""This shift will facilitate the extension of Israel's engagements with North African nations and the expansion of the Abraham Accords,"" Levitan stressed.
Zaga says that another factor shaping regional dynamics is the increasing global dependence on Qatar's LNG, driven by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the quest for economic alternatives, along with current fluctuations in gas prices.
Environmental Developments
Moonakal recalled the earthquakes in Morocco and Turkey, highlighting the challenges in effectively addressing natural disasters and shedding light on the vulnerabilities that can precipitate humanitarian crises in the region.
""These events underscore the limitations in preparedness and response mechanisms, particularly in regions prone to seismic activities,"" he said.
He also mentioned that environmental issues are compounding the existing challenges in war-torn nations like Syria and Libya. The earthquakes in Syria and the floods in Libya, he added, ""further emphasize the difficulties faced by these war-torn countries in managing and recovering from such crises.""
According to Moonakal, Iran's drought crisis, which has lasted for four years and includes a decline in autumn precipitation, is another significant environmental issue. He stated that these prolonged dry periods pose substantial risks and challenges for the country. ""The situation has prompted criticism of the Iranian government's environmental management, particularly in the aftermath of protests related to the disappearance of Lake Urmia in Tabriz,"" he added.
The dispute between Iran and Afghanistan over the Helmand River is also related to this issue. This, he continued, ""underscores the potential for environmental issues to exacerbate border tensions, especially amid disagreements and divergences with the Taliban.""
Outlook for 2024
Zaga said that, as the Israel-Hamas conflict has not yet ended, it is likely to further alter regional dynamics, but it is too early to predict the exact impact.
Corden-Lloyd added that the region is likely to experience increased insecurity as the conflict spreads across the Middle East. ""We are seeing willingness on behalf of the Houthis and Hizbullah to engage in this, and how a relatively small action like the engagement with shipping vessels, can have a big impact in line with Iran's strategic goals,"" he said, adding that Iran will probably continue to use its proxies to undermine regional security.
Moonakal, among other predictions for the new year, noted that a significant shift toward increased cooperation between Gulf states and Asian powers is expected. He believes this will shape and enhance regional alliances and partnerships.

Could Israel military tactics give Hamas a chance to rebuild?

As Israel transitions from ""stage 2"" of the war against Hamas to the longer ""stage 3"", experts warn that a reduction in the intensity of Israel's campaign could allow the terror organization to rebuild itself militarily in Gaza.
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Critical Threats Project, American organizations analyzing the IDF's war in Gaza, released an update to the ongoing Israel-Hamas War on Tuesday, stating that ""Israeli forces are transitioning to the third phase of their operations in the northern Gaza Strip, which will very likely enable Hamas to reconstitute itself militarily.
""Israeli forces have degraded several Hamas units and rendered others combat ineffective, particularly in the northern Gaza Strip, since the beginning of the clearing operations,"" the report continued. ""But Hamas's military forces are neither defeated nor destroyed at this time. Decreased Israeli pressure would allow Hamas to rebuild its military capabilities and infrastructure.""
According to the overall plan of the IDF for the war against Hamas, the third phase includes what has been defined as ""raids and remote attacks."" The IDF essentially has operational control over most of the major settlements in Gaza, although fighting continues in and around Khan Yunis in the south. As part of ""stage 3"", raids based on early intelligence will be carried out, and remote attacks will destroy infrastructure in areas where IDF combat troops have finished fighting.
To this end, earlier in December, the IDF's Division 252 was released from service for the time being, having completed its mission in northern Gaza.
Additionally, it was announced on December 31 that the 551st and 14th Brigades would also be released from active duty.
This scale-back, combined with the success in removing a large part of Hamas's threats to Israeli civilians, is part of the transition to ""stage 3.""
Much of Hamas's military infrastructure and leadership has been decimated since the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza. Most Hamas military and governmental complexes are now in IDF hands, and the military successfully reduced the firing of rockets from hundreds a day at the beginning of the conflict to minimal. By the end of December, the daily average was minimal.
There has also been much talk in Israel of ""the day after"" the war, with options including Israeli military governance, a Palestinian Authority-led government, or various other options. Hamas has also declared that it will be needed to be involved in any post-conflict governance of the Strip. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed that ""To talk about the day after, it needs to get here first. Only the IDF will have control.""
""The Strip will be demilitarized. There will be no power except Israel,"" said Netanyahu. The prime minister also noted that the IDF had eliminated over 8,000 Hamas terrorists.
However, Israel's failure to capture or kill the main leaders of Hamas in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif, plus the continued failure to locate and return the 133 remaining hostages in Hamas's hands, has led to fears that the longer the situation continues, the less successful the IDF will be overall. The longer Sinwar can continue avoiding detection in the subterranean tunnel complex Hamas has under Gaza, allegedly accompanied by several of the Israeli hostages, the longer he can direct the campaign against Israel.
The ISW and Critical Threats report also notes that despite Israel's success in killing many Hamas military commanders, there is no reason that successors should not have been planned and developed.
""Hamas maintains a conventional military structure, meaning that it should be able to quickly replace commanders who have died in the war,"" the report states. ""Several recently killed Hamas battalion and brigade commanders had led their units for many years, suggesting that they had the ability and time to develop successors to take their place. Such reconstitution is inconsistent with the stated Israeli war aims, which are to destroy Hamas militarily and politically.""
Ultimately, it would appear that while Israeli success in removing Hamas from power appears inevitable, its stated goal of destroying the terror may be far from certain, and the longer the military campaign goes on, the better the chance Hamas will have to survive and rebuild.

Peace rests upon the three pillars of destruction, demilitarization, and deradicalization.
Total victory will be achieved when Hamas is destroyed, the hostages are released, Gaza is demilitarized, and Palestinian society begins a deradicalization process. These are the three prerequisites for a possible peace between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors in Gaza and beyond.
First, the ""day after"" discussion must begin with the ""day after Hamas.""
Hamas, a key Iranian proxy, must be destroyed. The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and many other countries support Israel's intention to demolish the terror group. To achieve that goal, Hamas's military capabilities must be dismantled, its political rule over Gaza must end, and the hostages must be released.
Hamas's leaders have vowed to repeat the Oct. 7 massacre ""again and again."" That is why their destruction is the only proportional response to prevent the repeat of such horrific atrocities. Anything less guarantees more war and more bloodshed and contradicts the clear directive set by Israel's war cabinet.
In destroying Hamas, Israel will continue to act in full compliance with international law. This is especially challenging because an integral part of Hamas's strategy is to use Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages as human shields.
Hamas places its terrorist infrastructure inside and underneath homes, hospitals, mosques, schools, and other civilian sites, deliberately putting the Palestinian population at risk.
Israel does its best to minimize civilian casualties by dropping leaflets, sending text messages, and using other means to warn Gazans to get out of harm's way. Hamas, by contrast, does its utmost to keep Palestinians in harm's way - often at gunpoint.
Unjustly blaming Israel for these casualties will only encourage Hamas and other terror organizations around the world to use human shields. To render this cruel and cynical strategy ineffective, the international community must place the blame for these casualties squarely on Hamas. It must recognize that Israel is fighting the bigger battle of the civilized world against barbarism.
Second, Gaza must be demilitarized. Israel must ensure that the territory is never again used as a base to attack it. Among other things, this will require establishing a temporary security zone on the perimeter of Gaza and an inspection mechanism on the border between Gaza and Egypt that meets Israel's security needs and prevents smuggling of weapons into the territory.
The expectation that the Palestinian Authority will demilitarize Gaza is a pipe dream.
The PA currently funds and glorifies terrorism in Judea and Samaria and educates Palestinian children to seek the destruction of Israel. Not surprisingly, it has shown neither the capability nor the will to demilitarize Gaza. It failed to do so before Hamas booted it out of the territory in 2007, and it has failed to do so in the territories under its control today. For the foreseeable future, Israel will have to retain overriding security responsibility over Gaza.
Third, Gaza will have to be deradicalized. Schools must teach children to cherish life rather than death, and imams must cease to preach the murder of Jews.
Palestinian civil society needs to be transformed so that its people support fighting terrorism rather than funding it.
Currently, PA leader Mahmoud Abbas can't even bring himself to condemn the Oct. 7 atrocities. Several of his ministers deny that the murders and rapes happened - or accuse Israel of perpetrating these horrific crimes against its own people. Another PA minister threatened that a similar attack would be carried out in Judea and Samaria.
Successful deradicalization took place in Germany and Japan after the Allied victory in World War II. Today, both nations are great allies of the US and promote peace, stability, and prosperity in Europe and Asia.
More recently, since the 9/11 attacks, visionary Arab leaders in the Gulf have led efforts to deradicalize their societies and transform their countries. Israel has since forged the historic Abraham Accords and today enjoys peace agreements with six Arab states. Such a cultural transformation will be possible in Gaza only among Palestinians who don't seek the destruction of Israel.
Once Hamas is destroyed, Gaza is demilitarized, and Palestinian society begins a deradicalization process, Gaza can be rebuilt and the prospects of a broader peace in the Middle East will become a reality.
The writer is prime minister of Israel.

Were Israel not in the midst of a war in Gaza, were hundreds of thousands of soldiers not literally putting their lives on the line to defend the country, were millions of their relatives and friends not consumed with anxiety, worried about their loved ones' well-being, the upcoming week would have been a week of government chest-thumping.
It would have been a week of inflated claims of successes across a whole spectrum of spheres: diplomacy, economy, and security.
Why? Because next Friday, December 29, will mark one year to the swearing-in of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's sixth government.
In normal times, one-year anniversaries are typically occasions when governments boast about all their accomplishments - all governments, regardless of whether those accomplishments are real or imagined. The self-congratulation of governments on their first-year anniversaries is almost a national ritual.
But these are far from normal times, and - if polls showing that the country would give this government the boot if only given the chance - the country does not see the establishment of this government 52 weeks ago as any reason to celebrate. And that is an understatement.
According to an Israel Democracy Institute poll released this week, 69% of the public, including 51.5% of the respondents who consider themselves right-wing, wanted to see elections held immediately after the war. Opposition head Yair Lapid thinks there is no reason to wait even that long, and in a Ynet interview this week said that democracies can hold elections in the midst of war - he noted how the British Parliament ousted Neville Chamberlain and replaced him with Winston Churchill in 1940 as World War II raged.
Given the war with Hamas and the unprecedented internal division that preceded it as a result of the judicial reform, it seems for many in this traumatized country as though this government has been in power for much longer. The war itself has jumbled many people's sense of time. But, even if it feels to many a lot longer, Israel's 37th government has only been in power for a year.
One year.
LOOKING BACK today at Netanyahu's speech in the Knesset on December 29, 2022, and his statement a few hours later before the cabinet held its inaugural first meeting, feels akin to looking at the photo album of a wedding whose promise soured early on: hopes burst, aspirations shattered, and pledges left unfulfilled.
The first striking element when looking at the clip of Netanyahu addressing the Knesset a year ago is that the tone of those first 10 months of the government - before October 7 changed everything - was set when the heckling began after he uttered the first innocuous sentence of the post-introductory part of his speech: ""The new government today embarks on its way in the 75th year of Israel's independence.""
Already then, the shouting and jeering filled the hall, much as it did a year and a half earlier when Naftali Bennett became prime minister and Netanyahu's Likud barely let him get a word out.
Already then, on December 29, the rhythmic chanting that would hound Netanyahu for months and is bound to continue echoing after the war, commenced in the plenum. Opposition MKs repeatedly chanted ""weak, weak,"" highlighting their perception of Netanyahu yielding to the demands of his coalition partners. Within a few weeks ""weak, weak"" would morph into the resounding cry of ""shame, shame"" at anti-judicial reform protests around the country. At that initial Knesset session with the new government, the course had already been determined.
Netanyahu - during a moment of heckling - chided his political opponents for not accepting the will of the people.
""I hear the lamentations from the opposition about the end of the state, the end of democracy,"" Netanyahu said. ""But to lose an election is not the end of democracy, it is the essence of democracy. Democracies are judged first of all by the willingness of the losing side to accept the decision of the majority. In an organized democracy, the rules of the game are respected.""
Talk about foreshadowing what was to come in the months ahead.
IN HIS 18-minute address, a good part of it interrupted by opposition heckling and catcalls, and later in his opening statement to the cabinet, Netanyahu enumerated four main goals for his government.
What is striking in retrospect about both the statement and his speech is that the prime minister mentioned neither Hamas and Gaza nor judicial reform in either of those appearances. The two issues that have altered the country, that have dominated the last 12 months, were left out of celebratory remarks he gave ushering in his new government.
""We have four main goals,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet. ""First of all, stop Iran. This is an existential question. We, first of all, take care of existence and security.
""Second, to restore security and governance within the State of Israel,"" he said. ""The third thing, take care of the cost of living and the housing crisis. The fourth thing, and I believe it is also within reach, is to dramatically expand the circle of peace.""
Again, no word of judicial reform, which his justice minister would introduce a little over a week later, and which would divide the country in a way never seen before, providing Hamas - which, according to reports, had been planning the October 7 attack well in advance - with what it believed was the perfect time to hit: a country split and in disarray, with reserve pilots threatening not to serve, and political leaders casting aspersions on the generals.
In his speech, Netanyahu did mention the country's security situation, saying that he had ushered in the quietest period in Israel's history.
""Knesset members, I am proud of the huge achievements we have had until now: the peace accords we brought, the gas we extracted from the sea that is turning Israel into an independent energy power, the vaccines which took Israel out of the corona crisis first, and the quietest security decade in our history.""
It all seems so long ago - especially the part about the quietest security decade in Israel's history. When the various committees of inquiry begin their work when the war ends, this assertion will be challenged. True, statistically it may have been the quietest security decade in Israel's history, but at what price? At the price of allowing Hamas to entrench itself in Gaza and letting Hezbollah position itself within mere meters of Metulla.
Everything looks different now. Sure, it was a quiet decade, and in bringing it up, Netanyahu was underscoring his image as ""Mr. Security."" However, was it smart to sanctify quiet over directly addressing security challenges as they arose? Yes, it was a quiet decade. But was it quiet because the threats were dealt with, or was it quiet because the threats were swept under the rug and left for another day down the road?
And now that day has arrived.
Reflecting on Netanyahu's words on the first day of his government, considering what we know today, offers a much different perspective. For example, looking at Israel today in the context of the four points Netanyahu highlighted is not overly encouraging.
Iran has not been deterred and is obviously carefully watching to see how Israel performs in Gaza. If Hamas is left standing after the war, Iran's leaders could justifiably ask itself: Can a country that cannot destroy a terrorist organization on its borders demolish our nuclear program 2,000 kilometers away?
The war has done something else with regard to Iran as well: it has diverted attention, forced the world to look elsewhere - at Gaza - while Iran continues to move ahead on its nuclear program. According to some experts, it could now - if it so decided - make enough weapons-grade uranium for a nuclear bomb within a week.
Goals two and three were not met before the war - lowering prices and enhancing governance - and if anything, the war will make matters worse on both those issues.
And as far as ""dramatically expanding the circle of peace,"" that hope - at least in the short term - seems dashed, as the images aired from Gaza are having a sharply negative impact on Arab public opinion toward Israel. Saudi leaders may still want to reach an accommodation with Israel, but for the short term, they will be influenced by public opinion, which is currently in no mood for such a step.
But Netanyahu's words at that Knesset session a year ago are not the only ones that - in retrospect - seem so cut off from the reality as we understand it now. Outgoing prime minister Lapid also spoke with words that now seem divorced from the reality as it has emerged.
""In the security sphere, the last year and a half were the quietest in the Gaza border communities for the last 15 years,"" he said. ""We implemented a policy of no tolerance to inflammable balloons or any rocket fire from Gaza.""
He continued: ""Last August we embarked on Operation Breaking Dawn against the Islamic Jihad terror threat - one of the fastest, most effective, and deadly campaigns Israel ever carried out. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad leadership was thwarted without Israel suffering even one fatality.""
Except, as is becoming clear now, it was all a ruse, part of Hamas's web of deception, lulling Israel into thinking that the true threat was from Islamic Jihad, and that Hamas sought only quiet and accommodation. In other words, that it was deterred.
""We are handing over to you a state in excellent condition, with a strong economy, improved security capability and strong deterrence, and an international standing among the best here ever,"" Lapid said, addressing Netanyahu. ""Try not to destroy it.""
That was then, just one year ago.

A three-front conflict in the Middle East

Three linked conflicts are currently under way in the Middle East. These are: Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, the lower intensity battle under way between Israel and Hezbollah in the north, and the Houthis' maritime campaign in support of Hamas against international shipping in the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden area.
Since October 7, most media coverage has tended to regard the Gaza war as the central arena, and the other two fronts as subsidiary to it. This perspective needs to be revised. All three of these fronts are part of a larger regional dynamic. And all three are currently at or approaching a hinge point.
Northern border
""We're focusing our efforts on the south, but Hezbollah is continuing to act with aggression,"" said Lt.-Col. Jonathan Conricus, speaking to journalists in Kibbutz Rosh Hanikra earlier this week. ""We can do the same, if needed against Hezbollah, as we are doing against Hamas.... We have evacuated our civilians from the immediate danger zone, and we're in a defensive posture because we're focused on our operations in Gaza.""
A low- to medium-intensity conflict is currently going on, north and south of Israel's border with Lebanon, with daily exchanges of fire, constant alerts, deaths on both sides. Israel clearly enjoys the tactical advantage, and this is reflected in the casualty figures. Somewhere just over 100 Hezbollah fighters have died so far, along with 17 Lebanese civilians and one soldier of the Lebanese Armed Forces, according to AFP. On the Israeli side, seven soldiers and four civilians have died, as reported by Reuters.
The mood among the Israeli troops deployed in the North appears upbeat and determined.
""We're learning every day,"" Lidor, a company commander mobilized since October 8, told me. ""I was in the Kfir Brigade in the regular army, so we're seeing many things for the first time. But we're learning every day - and we're ready for anything.""
But while, tactically, Israel clearly has the upper hand, on the strategic level the situation is less positive.
Around 86,000 Israelis have left their homes as a result of Hezbollah's engagement in support of Hamas further south. There are no indications that they will be ready to return unless Hezbollah's deployment along the border comes to an end.
As to how this can be achieved, there have been reports of a US-led diplomatic effort to move Hezbollah forces from the border. The prospects for such an effort appear poor. It is not clear what inducements the US would bring to the table to make Hezbollah act in a way contrary to its core outlook and purpose. But the reports do indicate that the US remains opposed to any unilateral Israeli military move to drive the Iran-supported Shia Islamists from the border area. The continued maintenance of an effective ""security zone"" on the Israeli side of the border is untenable for Israel.
With the basis for diplomacy unclear, and military action evidently contrary to US wishes, the situation remains blocked. For as long as it is not resolved, the current reality represents a gain for the Iran-led regional bloc's goal of the slow chipping away at the chance for a normal life for Israelis.
Gaza
Israel's goal in its war in Gaza is the destruction of the Hamas-led authority, which has ruled the area since 2007, and which ordered and carried out the massacre of October 7. Tactically, again, Israel has performed well. The IDF has moved forward methodically and effectively in northern Gaza, where Hamas resistance is now only sporadic. Major operations remain in the south, to make achieving Israel's stated goal possible.
But again, the strategic picture is less encouraging. Three contradictory timetables have been operating throughout with regard to Israel's operation in Gaza. These are:
1. The military timetable - that is, the time that Israel needs to pursue its operation to the point where the Hamas authority has been destroyed, and efforts toward the creation of a successor authority can begin, with Israel maintaining its security hold on Gaza.
2. The diplomatic timetable - that is, the amount of time available until international pressure begins for Israel to wind up operations. The stance of the US, which historically has defended Israel for a limited period against pressure of this kind before joining it, is the crucial variable here.
3. The hostage timetable - that is, the ongoing effort to bring about the release of Israeli hostages taken on October 7.
These timetables are contrary because focus on the hostages will tend to slow down the military effort, while only a limited window for this effort exists until diplomatic pressure to bring it to a close begins in earnest. The obvious Hamas intention is to use the hostage issue in order to run out the clock, until such time as Israel is forced to break off the military effort before its goal has been achieved. Israel's interest is in ensuring this does not happen.
As of now, it appears that US and Western pressure for Israel to cease the high-intensity maneuver phase of the war by early January, establish a buffer zone and continue raids and pinpointed operations into Gaza is growing. If Israel acquiesces to this, it becomes likely that Hamas will reemerge as the de facto authority in a large part of Gaza. This will be seen, justifiably, by Hamas and its supporters as victory, and motivation for further attacks.
Red Sea/Gulf of Aden/Yemen
The third conflict front that has opened up as a result of October 7 is the maritime contest taking place in the area of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Gulf of Aden, and the Red Sea. In terms of potential global consequence, this may be the most important front of all.
As of now, the Houthis, who control northern Yemen, are engaged in a campaign of attacks on international shipping. More than a dozen ships have been targeted. Six million barrels of oil a day pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait. About 12% of global trade transits here on the way to the Suez Canal. As a result of the Houthis' terrorizing of ships passing through the strait on their way to the canal, a number of major shipping companies, including MSC, Hapag-Loyd, CMA CGM, and Maersk, have announced that they have suspended passage to the Red Sea because of the threat. Energy giant BP this week recorded a similar suspension. The cost for companies of shipping to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope instead of the Suez Canal is set to have a major economic impact. Oil prices have already risen by $2.12 to $78.67 a barrel since the attacks began.
The US this week announced the formation of a 10-nation naval coalition to defend shipping in the Red Sea from attacks by the Houthis. The Houthis have said that the attacks will continue. Mohammed al-Bukhaiti, a senior Houthi official, was quoted by Al Jazeera as saying that ""even if America succeeds in mobilizing the entire world, our military operations will not stop... no matter the sacrifices it costs us.""
The dimensions and nature of the operations that the new coalition will take to ensure the protection of shipping in the area remain to be seen.
So - three fronts of conflict in the Middle East, with a number of common factors. All three derive from the support afforded to movements of political Islam by the Islamic Republic of Iran, as part of its push for regional domination. All three are currently at a hinge point, where it will be determined if the opponents of the Iran/Islamist side will take the necessary and determined action to push back their enemy, or if the enemy will be permitted to unilaterally reshape the strategic balance.
The outcome of all three, therefore, depends on the extent of will possessed by the anti-Iranian and anti-Islamist side. Much regarding the future of Israel and of the Middle East may depend on the results of the contest on all three of these fronts.

Houthis, a wakeup call

US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin arrived in Israel for an important visit on Monday. Austin has come to the Jewish state before, in the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7. He understands the challenges Israel faces, and in the past has described Hamas crimes as worse than those of ISIS. Today it is imperative that Austin and the US administration continue to back Israel in the campaign against Hamas.
In addition, it is essential to confront and deter threats by the Iran-backed Houthis in the Red Sea and Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
This conflict now has multiple fronts. The US plays a key role in the region in terms of deterring these threats. For instance, when the Hamas war on Israel began, America ordered an aircraft carrier and its strike group to turn around in the Mediterranean and head towards Israel. This helped to deter Hezbollah.
However, Hezbollah today appears not to be deterred. For instance, the terrorist group carried out a drone attack on Saturday which killed Chief Warrant Officer Yehezkel Azaria, an IDF reservist who was serving in the North. The Hezbollah drone attack is an escalation because it shows how deadly the Lebanon-based terrorist group's drone arsenal has become. It is believed to have around 2,000 drones and has been using them systematically over the last two months.
Hezbollah also began to increase its attacks on Monday to coincide with Austin's visit. The group launched rockets at Israel as well as more drone attacks. Terrorists also launched anti-tank missiles at Avivim in northern Israel. In response, IDF artillery struck the threats, the IDF said. However, again, Hezbollah was not deterred, continuing to carry out attacks.
Israel has sought to spotlight the growing Hezbollah threat that has caused 80,000 Israelis to evacuate their homes since October 7. Hezbollah, which serves as a proxy for Iran, is risking a wider war. This could harm Hezbollah and has already destabilized southern Lebanon. The UN was supposed to monitor this and the international community must prevent the continued and endless Hezbollah attacks.
These attacks illustrate how the international community has not done enough to deter Iran and the groups it backs. Hezbollah's violations of UN Resolution 1701 are now making a mockery of the resolution and the UN. Many countries at the UN have called for a ceasefire in Gaza. However, it is important to note the hypocrisy here. Where are the calls for Hezbollah to cease fire and stop violating the resolution? Hezbollah's actions are the kind that lead to expanded conflict.
The Hezbollah problem is also reflected in the lack of action to deter the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. These attacks continued to target ships this week. Many shipping companies are beginning to announce they are pausing transits via the Red Sea, which has serious economic ramifications globally.
More than 20,000 ships use the Red Sea each year, meaning dozens of ships are transiting every day and are being threatened by the Houthis. Now is the time for a maritime task force to confront the Yemen-based Islamic movement. Backed by Iran, they have learned from Hezbollah that they can continue to carry out attacks with impunity. This is all part of the wider Iranian plan, which is to expand the fighting from Gaza and to create more fronts against Israel.
There is an opportunity now for the West to do the right thing and stand by Israel. Austin's visit, along with the head of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, gives them a chance to see the region today and understand Iran's destabilizing influence. As they take in their assessment from Israel's leadership, they will understand that the time to stop further conflicts is now. Israel must be allowed to defeat Hamas and bring the hostages home without Hezbollah or the Houthis creating more wars and conflict.
This week now represents a turning point in this regard. The Houthis and Hezbollah have dramatically ramped up attacks. Casualties in northern Israel are mounting, Israeli forces continue to be targeted, and ships in the Red Sea are at risk. With these different threats coming together, Israel's leadership has the opportunity to express our deep concern with the rising tide of attacks.

Iran's goal: Mire Israel in conflict

The US's role in the Middle East is declining, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Commander Maj.-Gen. Hossein Salami said in a speech over the weekend. This statement is not new to the Iranian regime, but reiterating it adds new details linking how Tehran views the US role and Israel's war against Hamas.
Salami was speaking at a funeral of ""unknown martyrs,"" usually a reference to those victims of the Iran-Iraq war whose bodies could not be identified. After a speech honoring the fallen, he turned his attention to Israel and the US.
""We will support Palestine until the end,"" he said, adding that ""Americans are packing their bags and leaving the region.""
Salami made a series of comments suggesting that equipment and money were not enough to win wars in the Middle East, reflecting the regime's policy of investing more in groups and people, such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, than investing in things. He then compared the current trend in the region to the last two decades of US policy.
""Did the occupation of Afghanistan bring them victory?"" he asked. ""We tell them: 'Why did you leave equipment as strong as an army when you fled Afghanistan? Were you able to stay in the Iraq that you occupied? Did you win in Syria, or did you just spend money? Were you able to create victory with these dollars in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, etc., or did you have to leave the field defeated, depressed, helpless, and unsuccessful?'""
Salami then compared the US policy in those countries with Israel's war against Hamas.
""The more they equip, the more nails they put in their coffin,"" he said, accusing Israel of fighting against civilians and harming hospitals.
The reality is that it is Iran-backed Hamas that purposely sought to exploit civilians and use hospitals as shields. Salami likely knows this.
He then claimed that Washington was behind Israel's war in Gaza, adding that the war was further tarnishing America's image in the region.
This is the dual narrative of Iran: On the one hand, it uses Hamas to attack Israel and destroy Gaza. On the other hand, it claims this destruction harms the US and Israel. Tehran seeks to play both sides in this respect.
Overall, Salami's speech continued to reveal the Islamic Republic's policy. Iran is using the war in Gaza to boost its influence in the region. The US and Israel are the main losers of this regional conflict, he said.
Countries in the region, Muslim nations,"" now have hatred for the US and Israel, Salami said.
""Today, the American authorities do not dare to be present in any of the Islamic countries,"" he said. ""Gone are the days when the red carpet was rolled out for you, and children were brought in from schools to wave at you. [But] wherever you appear today, hatred and insecurity are the main characteristics of the reaction of the nations.""
In this analysis, Salami openly explains Iran's goal: to drag Israel into a larger conflict, which Iran itself inflames via attacks by Hezbollah, the Houthis, and militias in Iraq and Syria. Tehran then uses these attacks to argue that the region opposes the US and Israel.
Nevertheless, it is Iran that is really behind all these attacks and instability.

Hamas weaponized anti-Zionism

Hamas is by far the most successful antisemitic entity in the world today.
Beyond all competition, it has mobilized Jew-hatred around the world, using the State of Israel both as its target and its primary weapon. By waging war against Israel over many years, Hamas has inspired and energized international organizations such as the UN and the EU; governments and parliaments; the Western media; university authorities, professors, and students; human rights groups; businesses; and large sectors of the general population.
All dance to its pernicious tune: some out of malevolence, some out of ignorance, and others blindly jumping on the virtue-signaling woke bandwagon.
Consequently, the global scope and scale of Hamas's antisemitic influence dramatically exceeds even the Nazis from whom it takes much of its own inspiration.
The foundations of Hamas's success lie in the Soviet Union. Back in the 1950s and '60s, when Israel aligned with the West rather than the USSR, the Soviet leadership decided to undermine American and British influence in the Middle East by fomenting a war of national liberation against Israel. Moscow invented a Palestinian national identity in order to turn religious malice against the Jews of Israel into a struggle over land, a cause it correctly understood would gain much greater traction and support in the West than a religious war.
That developed into the most successful slur campaign in history, giving rise to accusations of land theft, unlawful occupation, illegal settlement, apartheid, and all the other lies and distortions that are now accepted as undisputed facts by so many around the world. Decades of this anti-Israel propaganda have taken us to the dangerous position we are in today.
That means that whatever is done to Israel and its Jews is justified as legitimate resistance. I've even heard some saying that the people of Israel brought upon themselves the undiluted evil and savagery of Oct. 7. They had it coming. By the same token, any action taken by Israel to defend its people is unjustified, unlawful, and unacceptable. Like so much else in our post-truth world, facts and reality don't matter. If the ""oppressed"" Palestinians are doing anything, it's justified and understandable. If Israel is doing anything, it's intolerable and wrong.
EVER SINCE Israel attempted a two-state solution in 2005, unilaterally pulling every soldier out of Gaza and uprooting every last Jew from the territory, Hamas has used all of its energies to intensify and expand this global anti-Zionist paradigm. Hamas has always known it does not have the military power to achieve its objective of eradicating the Jewish state or even coming close to it. Instead, it has weaponized Israeli self-defense to its own advantage.
Every attack against Israel has been designed with the overriding purpose of eliciting a military reaction. It has deployed its weapons, communications sites, command posts, fighters, and leaders in places where Israel would have to kill innocent civilians in order to protect its population from them - despite the unparalleled measures the IDF takes to minimize collateral damage. Added value is gained by positioning terrorist infrastructure in locations protected under international humanitarian law, such as schools, hospitals, and mosques.
Hamas's aim is to maximize Gazan civilian deaths, especially of women and children, in order to provoke accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity; to delegitimize Israel; and to vilify and isolate it across the international community. This plan comes together every time, and Israel's necessary defensive action, rigorously adhering to the laws of armed conflict, is always accompanied by and followed up with outright condemnation in the UN Human Rights Council, by human rights groups and by hostile governments.
In what is the true cycle of violence in the Middle East, such denunciations in turn embolden and encourage Hamas to attack again and again.
These Hamas-provoked condemnations of Israel are amplified in the media and on campuses, including by the BDS movement and their like, as well as by the armies of useful idiots that slavishly follow Hamas's depraved agenda. The objective of these malignant groups is not so much to damage Israel directly, but more to intimidate Jews in the Diaspora. They seek to bully the strongest backers of Israel internationally, to coerce them to either abandon their support or to directly turn against the Jewish state.
Those who succumb to such manipulation do so both to avoid intimidation and to gain social acceptance in an environment where Jew-hatred posing as anti-Zionism is increasingly fashionable. It is particularly effective on university campuses, where the student targets lack intellectual maturity, experience, and depth of knowledge. And where life-long standpoints often take root. It has been well documented that the level of Jew-hatred is multiplied when Jewish anti-Israel organizations - themselves created through such harassment - are present on campus, which they are in increasing numbers.
POLITICIANS TOO are susceptible to anti-Zionist hate campaigns, especially when large numbers of Muslims are among their voters. Even those political leaders who support Israel will often seek to appease their anti-Israel voters. For example, in this war, the likes of US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have repeatedly called on Israel to observe the laws of war and to avoid killing civilians.
They say this time and again, despite knowing full well that Israel already does exactly that. This is especially dangerous because their words imply that Israel is, in fact, carrying out war crimes, and their ""confirmation"" serves to incite even greater Jew-hatred.
Thus Hamas and its supporters, in a carefully orchestrated campaign, stoke antisemitism around the world and feed off its malign effects. Terminating Hamas in Gaza, and hopefully elsewhere around the world, will have a major impact for as long as a successor to the terrorist group is not allowed to take hold there.
But although Hamas today is an antisemitism brand leader, it is of course far from the only major player. For its leading competitors, we don't need to look any farther than Judea and Samaria and, indeed, to the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose controlling hand lies behind so much of it.
The current conflict has caused a profound spike in Jew-hatred in the West, and there is no doubt that after the war, the steady-state level of antisemitism will settle at a new high. That should be of immense concern to governments in Europe, the US, and elsewhere, with their Jews facing this growing prejudice. It is their responsibility to suppress antisemitic hatred by defunding or shutting down those groups that are responsible, and taking a much harder line against the arch-offenders - the UN bodies in New York and Geneva.
As well as that, governments should be working to actively counter anti-Israel propaganda with the truth about Israel, rather than turning a blind eye or even fueling it as they so often do, even if inadvertently.
Here they could apply the same very effective approach that many of them took to persuade their electorates of the need to support Ukraine in its resistance to Russian aggression.
The writer is a former British Army colonel, who commanded British forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.

While wars are still fought with conventional armament, these days they can be sidelined, shortened, or even halted with a new type of weapon that is no less effective in winning the battle of public opinion.
The vicious lies and accusations, all meant to influence and appeal to society's heightened sense of injustice and grievance, are the new and improved emotional and psychological weaponization that is changing hearts and minds, even without the need for substantiation or context.
Here's just one example of how it works. A senior official in the Biden administration has left his position ""citing the president's handling of the conflict in Gaza."" In a letter sent to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Tariq Habash, special assistant in the Education Department Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development, stated that he ""cannot stay silent as this administration turns a blind eye to the atrocities committed against innocent Palestinian lives, in what leading human rights experts have called a genocidal campaign by the Israeli government"" (""US education official resigns over Biden's Israel-Gaza policy,"" The Jerusalem Post, January 4).
He never names the human rights experts who purport that Israel is committing genocide, nor does he refer to the initial heinous atrocities that took place in Israel on October 7 by the terrorist government of Gazans, which led to the present war that he apparently thinks should not be fought.
Habash, a Palestinian-American, must believe that a government whose people were brutally and savagely murdered should not respond in any way, because to do so constitutes genocide.
But there's a good reason Habash doesn't reveal the identities of these leading human rights experts, whose word he's taking for the vicious lies and accusations that are being hurled at Israel. If he would, we might discover that they are the same ""experts"" who have accused Israel of being guilty of genocide even before October 7 - a patently absurd claim, given the exponential growth of Palestinians throughout the years - a number that is said to have ""doubled about 10 times since 1948"" (""WAFA Agency: Number of Palestinians worldwide doubled 10 times since Nakba, official figures show,"" The International Middle East Media Center News, May 15, 2022).
Human Rights Watch (HRW), for example, has a history of excoriating Israel. ""HRW frequently levels baseless accusations against Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East, while victims of authoritarian regimes in Iran, Syria, and Yemen consistently get a pass. Their arguments sometimes border on antisemitism"" (""Five things you should know about Human Rights Watch's Report on Israel,"" AJC Global Voice, April 28, 2021).
They are not the only ones. In 2022, Amnesty International joined other human rights groups in their accusations of Israel committing apartheid. They claimed that ""Israel maintained 'a system of oppression and domination' over the Palestinians going all the way back to its establishment in 1948,"" (www.amnesty.org, February 1, 2022).
Similarly, B'Tselem, another renowned human rights group, has accused Israel of having a ""regime of apartheid and occupation, inextricably bound up in human rights violations."" Their website brazenly states that they ""strive to end this regime as the only way forward to a future in which human rights, democracy, liberty, and equality are ensured to all people, both Palestinian and Israeli, living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea"" (www.btselem.org, January 12, 2021).
Funny how they use the same term - ""the river to the sea"" - which has traditionally been the battle cry for ridding Israel of all of its Jewish presence. They never say who the Israelis are, and don't describe them as Jews. Of course, Arab Israelis are also part of the Israeli people, so, perhaps, a Jew-free presence is the goal of B'Tselem.
These are likely the ""experts"" to whom Habash refers, taking their word for the accusation of genocide and atrocities. And how much did Habash influence other staffers in the Biden administration - 17 of whom sent an anonymous letter, warning that Biden could lose voters over how he's handling the Israel-Hamas war.
How many of those 17 did their own research on how Israel is conducting a surgical, methodical, and deliberate incursion, designed to minimize collateral deaths of Gazan civilians - the same people whom Hamas uses as human shields? My guess is none of them.
Why should these staffers make any effort to make up their own minds by making careful inquiry into what precipitated this war in the first place? Running with the unfounded claims of a fellow worker is so much easier, and since he is ""supposedly informed"" by ""reliable sources,"" why even bother to question?
THE WEAPONIZATION of these lies extends to South Africa, which has made its own assertion of genocide by filing a complaint in the International Court of Justice in the Hague against Israel. It claims that Israel ""violated its obligations under the Genocide Convention,"" stating that ""acts and omissions by Israel... are genocidal in character"" as they are committed with the intent to ""destroy Palestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial, and ethnic group"" (""Countering the South African claims of genocide,"" The Jerusalem Post, January 5).
When you think about it, who needs rockets, drones, and suicide bombers? These incendiary accusations are enough to win the war by portraying Israel as the perpetrator of evil, only rivaled by the Nazis. Such hate-filled allegations are enough to jeopardize Jews worldwide, because they, too, by extension, are guilty of these same propensities, especially if they identify in any way with the Jewish nation - even if it's only by having a Jewish last name.
It is the reason Jewish students are frightened on their own campuses. It is the reason that outward identification, either through dress, jewelry, or door-post hangings, is being modified - for fear of being targeted as ""the enemy.""
And finally, it is the reason that more applications for immigration to Israel have been received than at any other period since the establishment of the Jewish homeland.
Someone figured out that world opinion can be swayed very easily. It only requires the dissemination of bad information, made to sound reliable by tacking on the word, ""expert,"" and suddenly everyone listens.
When enough people are willing to forego personal investigation, in favor of joining forces with a trendy mob, the results are the demonization of a country whose people have no right to fight back when attacked by terrorists who have made no secret of the fact that total annihilation of the Jewish people is their end game.
The weaponization of lies and accusations not only slanders the nation and the people, but it cleverly seeks to punish them through international courts for defending themselves and doing what any morally sane government would be expected to do - protect their population from danger and the threat of extinction.
Israelis are apparently the only people on earth who have lost that right, because any military action, on their part, has been deemed to be genocide. It's a shrewd tactic that has worked, but one that will, at some point, backfire, because when the first major terror attack is perpetrated outside of Israel, upon some group of hated Westerners, they will be the first to recognize that self-defense is not at all equal to genocide.

What if Iran were nuclear?

With the extreme pace of events following the October 7 genocidal attack by Hamas against Israel, the issue of Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program seems to have fallen by the wayside of public attention. But as consideration of the ""day after"" seems to now be underway, and in light of the understanding that the current crisis is surely not the last Israel will face, it is important to consider the counter-factual scenario of how this all would have played out if Iran had nuclear capabilities on October 7.
Of course, the first question that springs to mind is that of potential nuclear escalation and the risk of nuclear weapons being utilized. However, while this is no doubt a grave concern, we must also consider what Iranian possession of nuclear capability would mean regarding conventional war.
The interaction between the nuclear and conventional levels of conflict has long intrigued international relations scholars. This has led to rich analytical debates about theories, such as the ""stability-instability paradox,"" which considers that stable nuclear deterrence might lead to a destabilization at the lower conventional and sub-conventional (terrorism for example) levels of war and increase the number of conflicts.
Theories aside, however, history has shown the first 15 years of the US-Soviet nuclear relationship were fraught with crises, from the Korean War, through various other proxy wars, to the Cuban missile crisis. The India-Pakistan relationship had its own incidents, from the Kargil conflict of 1999 (set off by Pakistan that emerged as a nuclear state in 1998), to the Mumbai terrorist attack in 2008, and the Pulwama attack in 2019. It seems fair to state that emerging nuclear states, especially in a context where they are conventionally inferior to their rivals, are tempted, at least in the early stages of their nuclear life, to act more boldly, relying on their newfound nuclear capacity to balance out conventional inferiority.
IN LIGHT of this, it is reasonable to expect that the potential emergence of Iran as a nuclear power will lead to an emboldened position, in a region that is already full of flash-points, many of them resulting directly from Iranian influence and intervention.
The war between Israel and Hamas, which erupted as a result of the atrocities of October 7, quickly developed into a multi-arena conflict. Whether Iran and Hezbollah were aware of the scope and timing of the Hamas attack is unclear, but Iran's support for its proxy, Hamas, is evident and it is quite intent on protecting what it perceives as a major regional asset.
However, in the face of the strong and sustained Israeli military response, coupled with staunch support from the US in both word and deed, Iran's activation of its other proxies Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, and militias in Iraq has not resulted in providing effective protection for Hamas.
Now, imagine that Iran had but a minimal military nuclear capability on October 7. Faced with the images of the advancing IDF forces in the Gaza Strip and the firm Israeli response to attacks by Hezbollah, would Iran not then turn to nuclear brinkmanship? Would Israel then still adamantly pursue what its national interest absolutely dictates; the dramatic degradation of Hamas's infrastructure and capacity to govern the Gaza strip through an aggressive military campaign?
In the northern arena, Hezbollah is currently being deterred from using its large arsenal of rockets and missiles by the images from Gaza, Lebanese public sentiment, and the presence of substantial US forces close by - and Israel has been measured in its response. But if Iran were able to extend any kind of nuclear umbrella to Hezbollah in Lebanon, Nasrallah's role in the conflict would be far more active and detrimental to Israel, who would then be facing the materialization of Iran's vision of war on at least two fronts.
AS THINGS stand today, the missile attacks of the Houthi rebels on Israel, US forces, and various marine vessels in the Strait of Bab al Mandab have gone largely unanswered except for interceptions and a limited response to attacks on US forces in Iraq. This is probably due to the US goals of avoiding a wide regional conflict, preserving the unstable ceasefire between Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and evading direct conflict with Iran, a rival who seems to be a stone's-throw away from crossing the nuclear threshold.
While these US goals are most reasonable and will allow Israel to focus on the tasks at hand - ridding Gaza of Hamas, and pushing back Hezbollah - it must be noted that if Iran is able to employ as an effective deterrent its nuclear threshold state, this does not bode well for what might happen once it has crossed this threshold.
For many years, Iran has employed its proxies in the Middle East with impunity, never paying the price itself for the various hostile actions it is responsible for. Now, with it getting closer and closer to crossing the nuclear threshold as demonstrated by the latest report by the IAEA - with UN sanctions on its missile program having lapsed months ago, and in light of the current conflict, one thing is very clear - Iran cannot be allowed to cross the nuclear threshold.
This is not only because of the risk it would actually use them, which may cause a nuclear arms race in the Middle East but also because of what it would do in the region with a nuclear capability. By no means is this news, but time is running out to prevent this horrific scenario and to ensure that October 7 never happens again.

Who is next in line on Israel's terrorist hit list?

Since the beginning of the Gaza war on October 7, Israel has targeted senior Hamas officials, regardless of their location, in its aim to destroy the group's military capabilities.
The Israeli military and security agencies have targeted Hamas leaders since the armed Palestinian group began attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers, particularly in response to Hamas suicide bombings and other attacks that escalated following the signing of the Oslo Accords and intensified during the Second Intifada. The goal was to disrupt the operational capabilities and leadership of Hamas and stop further attacks.
Yahya Ayyash, often referred to as ""The Engineer"" due to his bomb-making abilities, was a prominent figure in Hamas and a key target for Israeli security forces in the mid-1990s. Ayyash was responsible for designing explosive devices used in deadly attacks against Israeli targets. Israel's finally got to Ayyash in January 1996, when he was assassinated by a bomb placed inside his mobile phone.
Another high-profile action was the January 2010 killing of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas offical, in Dubai. The operation was widely attributed to the Mossad, though Israel never officially confirmed its involvement.
Mabhouh was a founding member of the Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, and was believed to be involved in arms smuggling and coordinating attacks against Israel. The assassination carried out in a Dubai hotel room, drew significant international attention due to its complexity and the use of forged passports, leading to a diplomatic fallout and increased scrutiny of Israel's covert operations abroad.
On January 2, 2024, Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy leader of Hamas, was assassinated in a presumed Israeli strike in Lebanon, marking the most prominent targeted killing of a Hamas leader since the beginning of the war on October 7. Arouri, a key figure in Hamas's 2023 attack on Israel and responsible for expanding its activities in the West Bank, was killed alongside six others, including high-ranking Hamas operatives. This attack, in the Dahieh neighborhood, a predominantly Shia Muslim suburb south of Beirut, took place in the context of broader regional tensions, including the escalation of violence between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian proxy group in Lebanon.
WHO'S NEXT IN THE CROSSHAIRS?
Despite the advance of Israeli military forces into Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' chief in the Gaza Strip, remains unlocated and among Israel's most wanted individuals.
Last year, during a rally in Gaza, Sinwar delivered a speech in which he explicitly said Hamas would launch rockets into Israel, signaling a powerful strike. He declared, ""We will come to you with an endless number of rockets. We will come to you in a flood of soldiers without limits.""
Sinwar ascended to power as the leader of Hamas after serving 22 years in Israeli prisons for the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians. He was released from prison in 2011 as part of the deal to free Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit.
He is suspected of being one of the masterminds behind the murderous October 7 rampage in the Gaza border region. Since then, Israel has remained unaware of his whereabouts.
Sinwar's younger brother Mohammed Sinwar, born in 1975 in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, is a key figure in the Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades in the Gaza Strip. His military involvement began in 1991, and he rose to prominence as the commander of Hamas's Khan Yunis brigade in 2005. Notably, he participated in the abduction of Gilad Schalit in 2006, leading to the 1000-1 prisoner exchange in 2011.
Mohammed Sinwar has survived six Israeli assassination attempts, the latest being in May 2021. Contrary to reports of his death in the 2014 Israel-Gaza War, Sinwar was later found to have been hiding in Gaza's tunnel networks. In 2023, Israeli intelligence identified him as one of the masterminds behind October 7. As a result, Israel has placed him high on its list of targets in the military operation in Gaza, offering a $300,000 bounty for information on his whereabouts. His close relationship with his brother, Yahya Sinwar, further underscores his influential role in the organization.
Another target for Israel is Khaled Mashaal, a former chairman of the Hamas political bureau. On September 25, 1997, Mossad agents, under orders from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attempted to assassinate Mashaal in Amman, Jordan. The agents used fake Canadian passports and a device delivering a fast-acting poison. After Mashaal's condition worsened, Jordan's King Hussein demanded the antidote from Israel, threatening diplomatic fallout. US President Bill Clinton intervened, and the antidote was delivered, saving Mashaal's life. The incident led to the arrest and later release of several Mossad agents and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Mashaal currently resides in Qatar, where he actively advocates for Palestinian ""resistance"" against Israeli forces.
A complicating factor is that Qatar has helped mediate the Israel-Hamas conflict by facilitating hostage exchanges for the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. Mashaal is not the only Hamas leader residing in Qatar; Ismail Haniyeh, also wanted by Israeli authorities, is in Qatar as well.
Haniyeh not only serves as the chairman of the armed group's political bureau and was previously the Hamas chief in the Gaza Strip but is also the former prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. PA President Mahmoud Abbas removed him from this position in 2007.
Haniyeh recently traveled to Egypt to discuss with officials the provision of humanitarian aid to Gazan residents and the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
Mohammed Deif, born Mohammed al-Masri in 1965 in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, is the notorious head of the Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades. Deif, a key figure in Hamas since 1987, orchestrated several high-profile attacks against Israel, including the 1996 Jaffa Road bus bombings. Elevated to lead the Brigades in 2002, he has significantly advanced their military capabilities.
Deif played a pivotal role in the October 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. This attack, part of his ""above and below"" strategy, combined rocket assaults and tunnel warfare, demonstrating his influence on Hamas's military tactics.
Surviving seven Israeli assassination attempts since 1995, Deif has been a prime target due to his role in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. His resilience, despite personal losses including family members in a 2014 airstrike, and international designation as a terrorist by the United States and the European Union, have made him a prominent Palestinian ""resistance"" figure and a candidate for future targeted Israeli operations.
Marwan Issa, also born in 1965 in the Gaza Strip, is the deputy commander of the al-Qassam Brigades. Known as the ""Shadow Man"" or Abu Baraa, Issa has been a key figure in Hamas, particularly in planning the October 7 attack. He was detained by Israel during the First Intifada and later by the Palestinian Authority but was released after the outbreak of the Second Intifada.
Issa became the head of the Qassam Brigades in central Gaza's refugee camps and has been targeted, but survived, several Israeli assassination attempts, notably in 2006. Rarely seen in public until 2011, he was part of the negotiating team for the Gilad Schalit prisoner exchange. His home was bombed in 2014 and 2021.
As Deif's right-hand man and a key member of Hamas' secretive military council, Issa is one of Israel's most wanted armed fighters. The US designated him as a terrorist in 2019, and the European Union followed suit in 2023, linking him directly to the 2023 attack on Israel.
Israel now faces the challenge of potentially targeting Hamas officials in other Middle Eastern countries without causing political tensions with neighboring Arab nations.
Following the assassination of Arouri, Israel may face a backlash from Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who warned, ""If the enemy [Israel] thinks of waging a war on Lebanon, we will fight without restraints, without rules, without limits, and restrictions. They know what I mean.""

Bahrain-Israel peace is here to stay despite Gaza war, senior Bahraini envoy ensures. 'You cannot keep changing sides every time you don't like a government that comes into power in a country you have a relationship with,' says Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa

Despite the continuing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and the resulting explosion of anti-Israel rhetoric in much of the Arab world, a Bahraini former ambassador to the United Kingdom and senior member of the ruling royal family says the Abraham Accords will remain firmly in place.
Asked by The Media Line about the Bahraini public's increasing pressure to end ties with Israel over the war in Gaza, Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa replied, ""This will not happen.""
Al Khalifa, who served as Bahraini ambassador to the UK from 1996 to 2001 and has also held other senior administrative posts in the kingdom, said the Bahraini government ""will not be phased [fazed]"" by such attitudes unless there is an overwhelming majority, which there is not.
Under the Abraham Accords signed in September 2020, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel, followed in December of that year by Morocco.
Al Khalifa said the roughly 50% Shia population in Bahrain ""can at times be more sympathetic to extreme points of view... [but] you cannot keep changing sides every time you don't like a government that comes into power in a country you have a relationship with. We see this not just with Israel but with many other countries.""
The sheikh made his comments at a small private online event hosted by ROPES, the Regional Organization for Peace, Economics, and Security, a nonprofit organization working to promote a regional Arab-Israeli peace agreement. ROPES aims to connect forward-thinking and emerging leaders from Israel, the Palestinian territories, and about 10 Arab countries, and its network of alumni includes members of parliament, diplomats, journalists, entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists.
The online event was hosted by ROPES Executive Director and former Knesset member Ksenia Svetlova. The organization's founder and president, award-winning foreign-affairs journalist Ben Birnbaum, spoke about ROPES' mission and work, and several employees and alumni spoke about their experiences with the organization, including Program Coordinator Amira Mohammed, an East Jerusalem Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, and Alumni Relations Director and cohost of the ""ROPEScast"" podcast Ibrahim Abu Ahmad, a Palestinian Israeli from the Nazareth area.
Topics included antisemitism around the world, the future of the Abraham Accords, Iranian influence in the region, and peace prospects with the Palestinians.
Speaking of global antisemitism, Al Khalifa said, ""What's happening on campuses in the US and parts of Europe, you'd never see in the Arab world today... You'd be wrong to assume that, even in religious countries like Saudi Arabia, there's this widespread hatred of Jews.""
ON IRAN, the panelists discussed the need to expand the Abraham Accords.
""We all need to become part of a community that can face those kinds of challeng es... and we would love not only the UAE and Bahrain and Morocco and the countries of the Abraham Accords, but all of the Arab world to be on the same side with Israel, with Palestine, fighting security threats from those other countries,"" Al Khalifa said.
The hot topic at the event was the current Israel-Hamas conflict. The speakers acknowledged that there would be no going back to the status quo from before the attacks of October 7, and ROPES was already focusing on what comes next. The speakers said the answer lies in the next generation of leaders.
""[Despite the] darkness that has engulfed us, we are proud in ROPES to have a resilient network of young leaders who are dedicated and still have their eyes on the ball, on the big picture... a post-war stabilized Middle East that fully integrates Israel and the Palestinians, ideally based on the two-state solution,"" Svetlova said.
Al Khalifa said that the majority of Palestinians and the rest of the Arab world, apart from Hamas and other extremist groups, all want a two-state solution.
""So the ball is in the Israeli government's court,"" he said. ""We need to figure out the boundaries and details, including securing safety for Israel that ensures Israeli people do not come under threat and can stay until the end of time. But the Palestinians deserve to live as normal human beings with freedom and ability to run their country independently.""
Al Khalifa said that taking a ""baby steps"" approach might be the best way forward. Signing a peace deal ""doesn't mean opening the gates right away,"" he said.
""It will take will and commitment and a period of trust-building... The Palestinians are going to continue to pose a threat if they continue living as they are,"" he said.
But even more than this, Al Khalifa said that ""the players have to change."" He said the Palestinian Authority is ineffective and PA President Mahmoud Abbas ""understands that they need elections."" And he said the Israeli people also need both a change in leadership and a leap of faith.
""I think the Israeli people need to listen to people in the Arab world who say, we come as friends, and believe us, you will not be left alone with a future Palestinian state. We will be there to ensure the transition, and standing by to see that both sides stick to their sides of the deal,"" he said.
Birnbaum said, ""It's not enough for Palestinians and Israelis to be the only ones at the table if we want a peace deal. Other regional actors must be involved.""

Freeing the hostages and repelling the genocide lie

Next week marks 100 days that the 132 remaining hostages have spent in captivity after being abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip on October 7 by Hamas terrorists and Gazan civilians. Twenty-seven of the larger total are known to be no longer alive - some were killed before being brought into Gaza, and others killed under various circumstances after.
At the outset, no one believed that 14 weeks after October 7 Israeli forces would manage to release only one hostage alive, mistakenly shoot dead three hostages who had managed to escape their captives, and be responsible for several other deaths of hostages in the course of the fighting.
Over 100 hostages - most of them women and children - were freed by Hamas, under the auspices of the International Red Cross, within the framework of various exchanges for Palestinian prisoners in captivity in Israel, humanitarian agreements, short ceasefires, and Hamas gestures of goodwill to several foreign governments. Israel also managed to extricate from Gaza the bodies of several dead hostages.
From day one, the families of the hostages organized to pressure the Israeli government to have the issue of the hostages in first place among its war goals. They also pressured foreign governments and organizations to have the issue on the agenda of the international community in relation to the war in Gaza. The taking of civilian hostages in the manner that Hamas and individual Gazan civilians captured them, and brought them to the Gaza Strip, is contrary to international law, as is the way the Hamas authorities and their proxies have treated the captives since October 7.
As the days go by, the chances grow that many of the remaining hostages will not survive, due to the lack of medical care and malnutrition. Despite constant pressure, the International Red Cross did not see a single hostage until just before the approaching release of those freed.
The families of the hostages have been very vocal in their protests and demands, but are becoming increasingly desperate and insistent in their appeals, both in Israel and abroad. Many continue to doubt whether the hostages are the first priority in the goals and efforts of the Israeli government.
A group of hostage families, who met with the prime minister last Monday, completely rejected Sarah Netanyahu's appeal that they stop speaking to the media. She claimed that this merely caused Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to raise the price he is demanding for the release of the remaining hostages.
In the past, Sinwar agreed to the release of relatively minor Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip (including fuel), and short-term truces. However, today Sinwar is demanding, in addition to the release of all the Palestinian prisoners in Israel, a complete cessation of the war, and the departure of Israeli forces from Gaza. Israel is adamantly refusing to even consider the latter two conditions.
Israel is currently considering offering Sinwar a safe departure from the Gaza Strip (which is tantamount to Hamas stopping its organized resistance) in return for the release of all the hostages, alive and dead, including four who have been in Gaza since before October 7. However, there are differences of opinion in Israel whether Sinwar is open to such an offer.
Many Israeli experts believe that as a Muslim jihadist, Sinwar does not fear death, and is actually looking forward to turning into a ""shahid"" (martyr). It is also not clear whether at this stage Sinwar will agree to exchange all the hostages for all the Palestinian prisoners, with or without his own exit from Gaza.
Given the circumstances - and with time running out for many, if not all, of the hostages - Israel should make an extreme move: demand that unless all the hostages are released immediately, Israel will stop all humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip.
The last UN Security Council Resolution on the situation mentioned the humanitarian aid for the Palestinians in Gaza, side by side with the unconditional release of all the hostages (though the latter was mentioned only briefly and the former at great length).
I am sure that our American allies are opposed to our placing such a categorical demand, but am not sure whether we have an alternative, unless we are willing to forsake our hostages - an act that would intensify the schism within Israeli society, possibly to breaking point.
ISRAEL FACES another dilemma, concerning the South African request that the International Court of Justice in The Hague prevent Israel from committing acts of potential genocide, by calling for the immediate halt to Israeli combat operations in the Gaza Strip. The court's procedures will open on Thursday, and Israel will defend itself there against what it considers to be scandalous and totally false accusations.
It was decided to confront the challenge head-on, since the Jews suffered from a horrific, unprecedented onslaught of genocide during the Second World War at the hands of Nazi Germany, and since Israel signed the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in 1950.
Following the surprise Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 - when around 3,000 Hamas terrorists and numerous unaffiliated Gazans committed abominable atrocities against civilians - Israel declared war against Hamas. Israel's admitted intention is to obliterate Hamas's military and governmental capabilities, but without any accompanying genocidal intentions.
Since Hamas had embedded itself within the civilian population and constructed a massive underground city of tunnels to serve its own purposes, it was impossible to avoid causing massive destruction in the process of trying to destroy it.
Although Israel warned/s the Gazan civilian population of its planned attacks, and urged/s the inhabitants to move to safe areas, the number of civilians killed, including numerous children, has been large. However, it should be noted that of the 22,000 casualties reported by the Hamas authorities so far, according to Israel at least a third of them are Hamas terrorists.
The United States keeps urging Israel to try to reduce the numbers of deaths of innocent civilians, and Israel has been doing its best to avoid collateral deaths. However, numerous commentators in Israel have argued that there is no such thing as ""innocent civilians"" in Gaza, while many Israelis have started speaking of the need to ""wipe out"" or oust the Palestinians as a result of the October 7 massacre.
Politicians from the Religious Zionist Party, Otzma Yehudit, and some in the Likud, do not hide the fact that they believe that Jews should settle freely in all parts of the Land of Israel, and that the Palestinians should be wiped out, or ""encouraged"" to migrate elsewhere ""voluntarily."" South Africa was able to find many quotes suggesting genocidal intentions on Israel's side. However, none of them reflects official Israeli policy.
One wonders why the prime minister does not put an abrupt end to all this damaging talk, unless ""freedom of speech"" and his own political survival are perceived by him as standing above Israel's integrity and reputation.
The writer worked in the Knesset for many years as a researcher, and has published extensively both journalistic and academic articles on current affairs and Israeli politics. Her most recent book is Israel's Knesset Members - A Comparative Study of an Undefined Job.

Israel kills Iranians, proxies in Syria in two airstrikes. Gov't extends evacuation of North until end of February as exchanges with Hezbollah heat up

Multiple airstrikes by Israel reportedly killed between 17-19 Iranians and Iranian-proxies in Syria and at the Syria-Iraq border over the weekend.
In a very rare case, the Israel Air Force purportedly killed at least six Iran-backed terrorists at the Syria-Iraq border, two members of Iraqi militia groups told The Associated Press on Saturday.
Although Israel has frequently attacked Iranian proxies in Syria for years, and at a faster rate during the current Israel-Hamas war, the number of cases in which Israel attacks near the Iraqi border is very small, due to diplomatic sensitivities.
Hours before the Associated Press report, the Hezbollah terrorist organization announced that four operatives within their ranks were killed by Israeli attacks around the same time, which states that they were among the six that were killed in eastern Syria. The other two were reportedly Syrian fighters, the Iraqi militia members said.
Arab media also reported that airstrikes were carried out against sites identified with pro-Iranian militias in the Boukamal region of Syria near the Iraq border. Some of the reports, such as the Lebanese source Al-Mayadeen, state that the airstrikes have been attributed to Israel.
The attacks hit a weapons depot, a militants' convoy that had arrived from Iraq to Syria, and a training complex belonging to the pro-Iranian militia, according to The Syrian Observatory For Human Rights. The Observatory states that the number killed at the border is actually nine, saying that three of them were Syrian nationals.
At first the Observatory also said that the strike was done by US forces, but later it identified Israel as the attacker. The organization also said that the ""death toll is likely to increase due to the presence of more than 27 injured members of the militias.""
The Associated Press report stated that the attack on the border came hours after an ""umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants - known as the Islamic Resistance - claimed an attack on a US military base in the city of Irbil in northern Iraq."" The group has conducted attacks on over 100 US positions in Iraq and eastern Syria since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
In a separate incident, 11 senior Iranians officials were killed in an airstrike targeting Damascus International Airport on Thursday evening, Saudi media reported the following morning.
The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in eastern Syria, Nur Rashid, was injured in the airstrike, Saudi media channel Al-Hadath reported.
These Iranian officials were reportedly at the airport to meet with high-ranking delegates.
IRGC spokesman Sardar Ramzan Sharif denied on Friday reports that 11 of its leaders were killed in an airstrike in Damascus International Airport the night before, Iranian media quoted them as saying, as he said that such claims are ""baseless.""
Other strikes on Syria this week, foreign media also claims were done by Israel.
Syrian media also claimed on Thursday evening that Israel had targeted sites in southern Syria and near Damascus with airstrikes in two separate waves. Syrian air defenses were activated in the Damascus area during the strikes. The country's media quoted one Syrian military source as saying that the alleged airstrike carried out by Israel came from the ""occupied Syrian Golan Heights.""
Earlier this week, Iran vowed that Israel would ""pay"" for the killing of Sayyed Reza Mousavi, another IRGC commander who was killed by an alleged Israeli airstrike last Monday in the vicinity of Damascus.
Shortly after the strike that killed Mousavi occurred, footage on social media showed smoke near the Damascus airport, as Iranian proxies have often used the location.
Regarding the Lebanon border, the government announced that its official evacuation policy was extended for two months until the end of February.
It was unclear what the full ramifications would be of the decision, but it likely delays any major change in the current daily clashes between Israel and Hezbollah.
The IDF's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday that about 80% of Hezbollah rockets launched from Lebanon that day fell within Lebanese territory.
Adraee then attacked the terror organization for violating UN resolution 1701 and called on them to stop using the Lebanese people as hostages.
""In response to his attacks, we continue to strike Hezbollah's positions and its deployment in #South_Lebanon, which will never be the same as it was before October 7.""
This came the same day as a drone attack struck the Mount Dov area that is also known as Shaba Farms, which Lebanon claims as its territory.
Israel struck Lebanese territory in response, destroying infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah.
Hezbollah also announced that four of their operatives were killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon, on Saturday.
Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas War, between 130-160 terrorists have been killed in Lebanon, most connected to Hezbollah, but some to Palestinian terror groups.
There were extensive attacks by both Hezbollah and Israel against each other over the weekend as the escalation between the sides continued since last week.

Israel, Hamas said open to hostage deal as Austin on his way

Israel and Hamas are both open to a hostage deal, although disagreements remain on how to implement it, two Egyptian sources told Reuters as US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was slated to arrive in Israel on Monday.
Austin, who was in Kuwait and Bahrain, is also expected to visit Qatar, which along with Egypt is attempting to mediate a deal for the return of the more than 120 hostages remaining in Gaza.
Mossad Director David Barnea met Friday with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe, and according to some media reports, he is expected to hold a second meeting with him this week.
The deal is expected to be more complex than the one in November for mostly women, children, and foreigners. It might include an Israeli release of Palestinian prisoners responsible for killing Israelis in past terrorist attacks, KAN News reported.
Hamas is insisting on setting the list of hostages to be released unilaterally and demanding that Israeli forces withdraw behind predetermined lines, the sources told Reuters.
While Israel has agreed on Hamas setting the list, the sources said it demanded a timeline and to see the list before setting the time and duration of the ceasefire.
Israel refuses to withdraw, the sources added.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government have been under pressure to conclude a deal to free all the hostages. Hamas has publicly said it would only consider a deal that includes an agreement to end the IDF's military campaign in Gaza.
Israel has insisted that it plans to proceed with its military campaign to destroy Hamas, irrespective of any hostage deal. The past deal included an agreement to temporarily have a pause in fighting, and a new agreement is expected to do so as well.
As part of its efforts to negotiate a deal, and in a nod to its understanding with the United States, Israel over the weekend agreed to open its main commercial crossing into Gaza at Kerem Shalom for humanitarian aid for the first time since the start of the war.
""Israel is committed to continue working with our partners to facilitate large amounts of aid to the people of Gaza,"" said Col. Moshe Tetro, head of COGAT's Coordination and Liaison Administration to Gaza.
The opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing would allow Israel to ""abide by the terms of our agreement with the United States,"" he said.
It will also ""increase the amount of aid entering the Gaza Strip, where it will continue to be met by international aid organizations that will deliver it to the people of Gaza,"" he added.
""Our war is not with the people of Gaza,"" Tetro said. ""Our war is with Hamas.""
Israel had only allowed humanitarian aid to enter Gaza through Egypt's Rafah crossing, a move that has been fraught with difficulty given that the passageway is not designed for the high-level flow of goods.
The US had promised to renovate the Rafah crossing, and Kerem Shalom would be used only as an interim crossing, Netanyahu said Saturday.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency said: ""Continued heavy Israeli Forces' bombardments of the #GazaStrip, imposed access restrictions and limited humanitarian supplies detrimentally impedes @UNRWA's ability to provide aid.
""#Gaza is becoming the graveyard of a population trapped between war, siege and deprivation,"" it wrote in a post on X
The United Nations Security Council on Monday is set to debate a resolution calling for the opening of all land, air, and sea routes into Gaza, although at present, there are only land crossings. Israel has long had a military blockage against air and sea routes into Gaza for security purposes.
The resolution also calls on the UN to establish a monitoring mechanism for the goods that enter Gaza. It also calls for the release of the hostages and a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, who visited Israel on Sunday, called for a humanitarian pause in the fighting, which she hoped would lead to a permanent ceasefire.
According to Hamas, 19,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza war-related violence with Israel, and about 7,000 of the fatalities were combatants. Hamas killed 1,200 people and seized about 250 captives when it attacked Israel on October 7, sparking the war.
Pope Francis on Sunday again suggested Israel was using ""terrorism"" tactics in Gaza, deploring the reported killing by the IDF of two Christian women who had taken refuge in a church complex.
At his weekly blessing, he referred to a statement about an incident on Saturday by the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Catholic authority in the Holy Land.
An IDF ""sniper"" had killed the two women, Nahida Khalil Anton and her daughter Samar, as they walked to a convent of nuns in the compound of the Holy Family Parish, he said.
The Patriarchate statement said seven other people were shot and wounded as they tried to protect others.
""I continue to receive very grave and painful news from Gaza,"" Francis said. ""Unarmed civilians are the objects of bombings and shootings. And this happened even inside the Holy Family parish complex, where there are no terrorists, but families, children, people who are sick or disabled, nuns.""
Francis said they were killed by ""snipers"" and also referred to the Patriarchate's statement that a convent of nuns of the order founded by Mother Teresa was damaged by Israeli tank fire.
""Some would say, 'It is war. It is terrorism.' Yes, it is war. It is terrorism,"" he said.
The Foreign Ministry said the incident was still under review, and it had no immediate comment on the pope's words.
It was the second time in less than a month that the pope used the word ""terrorism"" while speaking about events in Gaza.
On November 22, after meeting separately with Israeli relatives of hostages held by Hamas and Palestinians with family in Gaza, he said: ""This is what wars do. But here we have gone beyond wars. This is not war. This is terrorism.""
Later that day, a messy dispute broke out about whether he used the word ""genocide"" to describe events in Gaza, with Palestinians who met him insisting that he did and the Vatican saying he did not.
Jewish groups criticized the pope for last month's ""terrorism"" comments..

Exiling Hamas's military wing is needed in exchange for a hostage release, Sa'ar tells 'Post'
Israel should put forward its own ceasefire plan calling for the exile of Hamas leadership and military wing in exchange for the release of the hostages, United Right Party leader Gideon Sa'ar told The Jerusalem Post as he laid out three mistakes Israel has made in conducting the Gaza war.
""We always return to the same ineffective ideas wrapped in bombastic statements that won't lead to victory. The time has come for new ideas,"" he said.
The veteran politician, who is a fierce opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, quit the government this week, after making a failed bid to be included in the war cabinet.
He had entered the government together with the National Unity Party at the start of the war to make a difference, but once he understood that was not possible, he left, in a move that was symbolic of the political turmoil, but which barely dented the coalition's governing capacity, bringing it down from 76 to 72 seats.
""We are stuck in every direction. We are stuck in Gaza. We are stuck on the Lebanese border. We are stuck with the hostages, and we are stuck in the international arena,"" Sa'ar explained, as he sat in his office in the Knesset wearing a suit and tie.
He arrived late to the interview due to a vote in the plenum and left in the middle to participate in a second vote. He spoke in a week of high tension between Israel and the United States and amid increased international pressure on Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire, and if not, to at least pause hostilities until the end of Ramadan on April 9.
""It's clear that the world wants [Israel] to end the war. It's clear that the US administration, for all kinds of reasons, wants the war to be over. So Israel has to stand [alone] against everyone.
""But you can minimize the dispute with a better handling of the issues that cause us problems and with [the initiation of] more proactive policies,"" he stated.
SA'AR FOCUSED on three errors Israel should correct in Gaza, now that the war sparked by Hamas's invasion of Israel on October 7 will soon hit the half-year mark.
The first, he said, he put on the table already in October. He called for the ""surrender and exile of the Hamas military wing and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Gaza to countries friendly to them: Syria, Turkey, Qatar, and Iran.""
The hostages would be freed in conjunction, and the deal could also include an Israeli agreement to release some Palestinian security prisoners and terrorists, he said.
The framing of the idea, he said, should be that it is Israel's ceasefire proposal, rather than perpetually being in the position of appearing to object to a halt to the war.
It also works as an answer to the international objections to Israel's pending military operation in Rafah to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions.
The ""argument against it would be that Hamas won't agree to it. That is probably correct,"" he said, ""at least not at this moment.
""But at least we can tell the world and say, 'We want to enter Rafah, but we do not have to.' If this [Hamas surrender and exile plan] happens, then we can end the war. You say you want a ceasefire. You want to end Hamas's governance [of Gaza]. Well, here is a pragmatic idea that also ends the humanitarian suffering caused by the war,"" he stated.
This framing helps put the onus on Hamas for the failure to achieve a ceasefire, he explained.
""It gives us more legitimization with our friends, and then, if there are no other options,"" Israel can explain that it has to finish the war because Hamas won't agree to end it, Sa'ar said.
His second issue dealt with the failures around the delivery of humanitarian assistance, for which Israel did not provide options effectively and quickly enough.
Sa'ar spoke amid a bitter dispute between Israel and the international community on the issue of humanitarian assistance, with the United Nations and the European Union accusing Israel of creating starvation conditions in Gaza.
Israel has said that more than enough aid enters Gaza, but that the UN and international organizations have failed to properly distribute it.
The army should have seized control of the situation from the start and created a humanitarian administration to ensure the distribution of food and the provision of water and basic sanitation, Sa'ar said.
The international community would still provide the aid and be involved, but the army would have oversight to make sure that delivery is successful.
""I know the army doesn't love this,"" Sa'ar said, acknowledging that there are some risks with the plan, which could lead to increased friction between the IDF and Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
It's a plan that also tackles some of the governance vacuum created by the IDF's military campaign against Hamas, which partially but not completely eliminated the terrorist group's forced rule of the enclave.
Until Hamas is destroyed, there can't be an alternative government in Gaza, Sa'ar said, adding that IDF control of the distribution of basic services, in partnership with international organizations, is the only smart option that can prevent the terrorist group's return.
If the IDF had taken charge of issues of food, water, medicine, and sanitation, Israel would have a better ""standing in the international community,"" Sa'ar stressed.
His third point, Sa'ar said, is that the war has to proceed at a quicker pace for the sake of Israel's economy, its international standing, and the looming threat of an all-out war with Hezbollah in the north.
""We have always known that we needed to wage the war as quickly as possible,"" he said. ""It is hard for us to wage long-term wars.""
Some thought that the international community would lose interest in the war as time went on, Sa'ar explained, adding that he always believed Israel had a tight timeline for the war.
""It was clear from the start that this idea was mistaken. We can't drag on the war forever,"" he said.
""As long as you haven't ended the Gaza war, you can't deal with Hezbollah,"" he added.
Hezbollah has to withdraw from the border, he said, as he referenced diplomatic efforts to ensure that it complies with Resolution 1701, which set out the ceasefire terms that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006.
Only then can the residents in communities along that border, who were evacuated at the start of the Gaza war when violence broke out simultaneously with Lebanon, return home.
In the end, they will return home. ""It has to happen,"" Sa'ar stressed, but that he hopes Israel will do it through diplomacy and not through a full-scale war.
SA'AR, WHO began his political life in the Likud in 2003, and formed his own party, initially called New Hope, in 2020, does not disagree with all of Netanyahu's policies.
He has always been opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state, even more so now in the aftermath of October 7.
""A Palestinian state is a danger to Israel, to its security, and it is not a 'maybe' danger; it's a clear danger. The creation of a Palestinian state would allow them to continue their war to destroy Israel from an improved position."" It would ""strengthen those Palestinian forces who believe that war brings results.""
Israel has to work to prevent Palestinian statehood, he said. It can take a positive stance on other issues regarding the Palestinians, but it can't allow itself to go in this direction.
Should the Palestinian Authority be reformed, such that it stops its monthly payments to terrorists jailed by Israel and the incitement in its education system, then it could be possible to advance in certain areas, he said.
Sa'ar said he stands with Netanyahu in opposing the return of the PA to Gaza. He has also supported many of the stances Netanyahu has taken in the international arena, including in his relationship with the United States.
""Netanyahu is acting to preserve Israel's international interests in this war, and in most of the situations when he fought with the US, I thought he was right,"" Sa'ar explained.
""Historically, prime ministers have been at odds with supportive US presidents during a war,"" Sa'ar said, as he recalled the diplomatic battles between former prime minister Menachem Begin and former US president Ronald Reagan during the First Lebanon War.
He pointed to the most recent battle between Jerusalem and Washington over the Biden administration's failure on Monday to veto a UN Security Council resolution that called for a temporary pause to the war, without tying it to the release of any of the remaining 134 hostages in Gaza.
Before the UNSC vote, Netanyahu threatened that if the US didn't use its veto, he wouldn't send a high-level delegation to Washington for a scheduled meeting. After the vote, Netanyahu held to his word but has since backed down and is looking to dispatch the delegation to the US next week.
It was a mistake for Netanyahu to attempt to back the US into a corner, and it didn't increase the chances of a veto, Sa'ar said.
Netanyahu should have kept his objections private, but essentially he was correct that the vote was bad for Israel, Sa'ar said.
The issue here is one of style, he explained.
Netanyahu has ""to know how to stand strong with friends, but to do it when it is essential, and to do it in a respectful way,"" Sa'ar said.
He himself has a long history of standing on principle and was one of the group of what was known as the ""Likud rebels"" who opposed former prime minister Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the destruction of the 21 settlements there.
Sa'ar recalled how he had argued with former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, who was then in Sharon's government, about the Disengagement. She had contended that the withdrawal would legitimize Israel's right to self-defense against the Palestinians, Sa'ar recalled. He had disputed that.
History has shown, Sa'ar said, that ""I was correct.""

Hamas's murderous October 7 attack wasn't only about hurting and killing people - it was part of a larger, more ambitious plan: to remove all Jewish presence from Israel. This is why victory won't be gained merely by destroying Hamas but by making it clear to Israel's enemies that we Jews aren't going anywhere, that more Jews plan to move to Israel (""make aliyah"") and help to improve the country's society and economy.
October 7 was, without doubt, one of the hardest days in Israel's history. However, it also reminded us of the amazing people around us. Israel Defense Forces reservists arrived at their bases hours before they were officially summoned, with some units reporting that 130% of their manpower had arrived. Families opened their homes and hearts to people they had never met or spoken to. The days following the Hamas attack were a national emotional rollercoaster in which despair constantly mixed with love and hope.
But Israelis weren't the only ones who stepped up to the plate. Around the world, Jews found ways to help Israelis they had never met. Duffel bags of clothing and military equipment were purchased and flown to Israel; some 300,000 people rallied in Washington DC in what was described as the largest Jewish demonstration in American history, and children wrote to Israeli soldiers in English, French, and Spanish with one message: In the face of evil, ""Am Yisrael Chai"" (""The People of Israel live"").
This support is amazing, and not taken for granted.
However, in the bigger picture, this help is tactical. If Jews want to be part of the strategic battle, they need to come to Israel. This war with Hamas isn't only on the battlefield. It is a long, ongoing war of ideas and ideals. Our enemies' desired outcome is not that our soldiers surrender - they wish [to kill us or] that we relocate from Israel to other countries; ""From the River to the Sea..."" They want ""Palestine"" to be Jew-free.
When I look at my enemy's wishes, I know we must do the exact opposite. If Hamas and others' desire is to kill us, we must live. If they want to destroy our homes and kibbutzim, we must rebuild them. If they do not want Jews living in our ancestral homeland, we must encourage Jews to come and live here. It is simple, yet sometimes the obvious needs to be stated: Winning the war means rebuilding Israel and living here.
And this is why Jews around the world can play a key role in the war effort. We want to see more Jews living in Israel or taking practical steps toward that goal; visiting Israel; more students electing to study in Israel; more young professionals interning in Israel - more Jews eventually making aliyah and turning Israel into their home.
This is why we established Belong, a social enterprise aimed at encouraging aliyah and improving the experience, by customizing the journey and supporting those who decide to join us in building the Jewish nation-state. Jews should view Israel as a magnet to run towards, not as a refuge they seek when fleeing hardships. At the same time, the Israeli public needs to start viewing those who choose to immigrate to Israel as cultural and economic assets who should be welcomed and invested in. This is our job. To make sure Jews know, and feel, that they belong in Israel.
For too long, aliyah and the Israel-Diaspora relationship have been viewed as purely ideological, fields for nonprofit organizations and do-gooders. But as in other fields of life, it is time to change this paradigm.
The difficulties for those seeking aliyah should be resolved with business tools and experience; with the outlook not only of people who care, but people who believe their work needs a positive return on investment (ROI). My belief in Israel, and in the Jewish People, isn't new. But my decision to establish a social enterprise in this field is.
October 7 started what will be a seismic shift in Israeli society, and all the Jews should be part of these changes. After all, Israel isn't only my home - it's our home, and to win the war we must all be part of it.
The writer is the founder and chairman of Belong, a new Israeli social enterprise that aims to encourage immigration to Israel and to improve the experience of moving here.

The big chill sets in, once again
Jerusalem Post
March 29, 2024 Friday

Byline: DAVID M. WEINBERG
Body


In June 2014, then-US president Barack Obama green-lighted a Fatah-Hamas unity coalition, leaving Israel ominously isolated. Israel stood by its solitary self in absolute opposition to the government cunningly created by Mahmoud Abbas and Ismail Haniyeh.
Just about every Western leader was prepared to swallow the Palestinian deception in which ""technocrats"" were to run government ministries as stand-ins for the real power brokers in Palestinian politics (i.e., Hamas). Just about everybody was prepared to play dumb and pretend that Iranian-backed jihadists committed to the genocide of the Jewish People in the Land of Israel weren't going to be the recipients of Western aid and diplomatic cooperation.
Nobody was prepared to admit that the Palestinian Authority had gone defunct; that Palestinian statehood had become a hazardous idea; and that Israel had no genuine Palestinian partner for a peaceful two-state scenario.
Obama and the Europeans were unable to acknowledge any of this since they had invested so heavily in the PA and Abbas, and it was so much simpler to vilify Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu as the obstacle to peace.
Indeed, distancing America from Israel had been Obama's modus operandi from day one. He infamously warned in March 2014 that Israel could expect to face international isolation and sanctions from countries and companies across the world if Netanyahu failed to endorse his bid for Palestinian statehood.
He proceeded to lament the fact that America, in his words, did not any longer have absolute power in this ""diffuse"" world, and that he would not be able to ""manage"" the coming anti-Israel fallout.
There wasn't really much anguish in Obama's voice. Obama wasn't too upset about Israel's ""impending isolation"" or the fact that America ""would have reduced influence in issues that are of interest to Israel.""
It was all very artificial. Obama was merely feigning dismay at the possible isolation of Israel, while in practice purposefully paving the way towards Israel's isolation and an American distancing from Israel.
The give-away was Obama's total failure to place any responsibility on Palestinian leaders for retardation of peace. There was not a smidgeon of answerability that he attached to Abbas or Hamas. He had nothing to say about Hamas stockpiling of Iranian missiles and RPGs. He issued no warnings of PA diplomatic isolation or economic collapse if Abbas did not compromise and advance the peace process. Only to Netanyahu.
But of course, Obama truly ""wished he had the influence"" to arrest the isolation of Israel. Yeah, right. The big chill was on.
THIS HISTORY is relevant to the current moment when Israel is being threatened once again with ""international isolation"" and even an arms boycott by a US administration filled with Obama acolytes.
US-Israel relations are indeed at a watershed moment following the administration's decision this week to abstain on (i.e., not veto) a rotten UN Security Council resolution that thoroughly delegitimizes Israel's necessary and continuing war effort to eliminate Hamas in Gaza.
Next will be a long series of demonizing and criminalizing anti-Israel resolutions in UN agencies and international courts. (The Human Rights Council discussed four vicious reports on Israel this week and is to front several resolutions including a finding of ""genocide"" supposedly being committed by Israel against Palestinians in Gaza.)
Internationalizing the conflict and criminalizing Israel always was a central Palestinian strategy. Alas, US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are now acquiescing in this horrible scheme, in order to wedge Israel into their fantasy framework for a swift, dangerously indecisive, end to the Gaza war.
This includes a gambit for ""revitalized"" Palestinian statehood and a magnanimous soft deal with Iran that magically will make all regional wars go away, from Sana'a to Beirut and Rafah.
Like Obama, Biden and Blinken will be ""unable to manage"" or mount a defense of Israel if Israel does not bend to their will.
The big chill again coming from Washington is uncomfortable, but Israel has no choice but to resist. It is not an exaggeration to say that Israel stands at a moment of grand diplomatic inflection, a pivotal moment with historical implications for Israel's sovereignty and long-term security.
At issue is not just the question of how and when to destroy the remaining four Hamas brigades in Rafah in Gaza. Nor is the issue humanitarian aid to Palestinians trapped in the hell created by Hamas.
At issue is the regional and international perception of Israel as a country capable of resoundingly winning an existential war of self-defense; a war against the first Muslim Brotherhood state ever established (Hamas in Gaza), a state that has genocidal plans for Israel long into the future again and again - unless eliminated.
At issue is the regional and international perception of Israel as a country with the determination to rout the Iranian-backed Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah proxies that have forced Israel into repeated rounds of draining warfare, and which now have depopulated and destroyed significant parts of southern and northern Israel.
At issue is the regional and international perception of Israel as a nation that cannot be steamrolled into diplomatic or military defeat; that is able to act on its essential security imperatives and free all of Israel (including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Judea and Samaria) of terrorist violence and rocket attacks.
At issue are regional and international perceptions of Israel as a society that is unified, resolute, and just; whose moral compass in wartime is unwavering; and whose partnership is reliable.
WHAT THE Biden administration all-of-a-sudden does not seem to understand (perhaps due to narrow electoral reasons), is that Israelis are mobilized and united to unambiguously win, with crushing certainty. This is not just ""Netanyahu's war,"" as Western wags have slurred.
For all of Biden's true personal commitment to Israel, his administration also does not seem to comprehend that Western civilization itself is under attack from radical Islamist barbarians - with the Hamas war on Israel (alongside Hezbollah and Houthi attacks) being only the frontline of a broader assault on ""Rome,"" i.e., all the West.
This is truly a world war that cannot be nicely dialed down by accommodationist diplomacy. And this is a war that best can be won if Washington stands by natural allies like Israel instead of punishing them.
Israel cannot knuckle under. Israel stands quite alone, but what is new about that? ""Lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations"" (Numbers 23:9). Being ""unreckoned"" is unnerving but familiar territory for the People and the State of Israel.
This is not a desirable situation, nor should Israel accept this as a permanent reality. There is much Israel must do to overcome gaps between its perception of the immediate and long-term challenges and those of other nations. There is much that Israel can and will do by resolute action that will force a grudging, positive reassessment by other nations, in due time.

An Israeli peace plan?

As Israel is in the midst of a bitter war, it is difficult to be thinking about a peace plan. The government of Israel is adamantly opposed to the American push for a Palestinian State. This is seen as a reward for terrorism and a betrayal of the principle of direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
Agreed.
But the status quo is obviously not satisfactory, neither for Israel nor for the Palestinians. Much of the world, even those countries most friendly to Israel, want to see an end to the endless conflicts in the region. The longer the war goes, the greater is the world's pressure to recognize a Palestinian State.
What if Israel came forth with a realistic peace plan of its own? What if Israel would not only agree to a Palestinian State but would be the first to recognize it? What if Israel, instead of constantly being seen as an obstruction to peace, was actually the foremost promoter of a peace plan?
The precondition of such a plan would be that Israel will only negotiate with Palestinian leadership that fully recognizes Israel's right to exist; that commits itself to maintaining peaceful relations with Israel; that makes a concerted effort to eliminate anti-Israel and anti-Jewish propaganda, educational material. In short, Israel should very much want a peaceful neighbor free of Hamas and Hamas-like ideologies.
If the United States and its Arab allies could find and encourage such a Palestinian leadership, this would be a great blessing to Israel and the Palestinians. If Israel would produce a peace plan that would put the onus on Palestinians to agree to peace, this would be a dramatic step forward.
We pray that Israel's current war with Hamas will end with as great a victory as possible for Israel. The victory must be not only military, but also political and diplomatic. The amazing courage and sacrifices of the IDF are awe-inspiring. Their victory on the battlefield should be followed by victories for Israel in the areas of diplomacy and politics.
Yes, it seems highly unrealistic to find a congenial Palestinian leadership able and willing to negotiate seriously with Israel. It also seems highly unrealistic for the current Israeli government even to consider a peace gesture. But moving forward will require visionary and courageous leadership. It is easy to dismiss peace talk as being in the realm of fantasy.
Former prime minister David Ben-Gurion is reported to have told his advisers: ""We don't need experts to tell us it's impossible; we need experts to tell us how to achieve the impossible."" Israel has always been able to achieve the impossible in the past: it can strive to do so now.

The Purim tale, retold through the biblical Book of Esther in Jewish communities around the world this weekend, provides an excellent lesson to presidents, prime ministers, and commoners in understanding the link between Providence and human endeavor, and the challenges of Jewish history.
The megillah scroll hints that beyond the intrigue of royal courtyards; behind the politics of a White House or a Kremlin; and besides the movement of foreign and threatening military forces - lies a Hidden Hand operating on a transcendental plane.
Beyond the grasp of man's finite mind, there is order and purpose. There is a higher Divine order into which man has not been initiated. In short, what appears random, isn't. The ""pur"" (the drawing of ""lots"" as in a gamble or ""happenstance"" hinted at in the word Purim) is really planned.
And thus, over and above the threatening actors around us - from the time of Haman in ancient Persia to the Ayatollahs of Shi'ite Iran, and from Amalek of Exodus to the anti-Jewish and anti-Israel wildly woke intelligentsia (so-called) of today's Western world - there is an engaged and concerned G-d. And he acts to protect the Jewish People, especially when we screw up.
The grand sweep of Jewish history is a sustained tutorial against the evils of brutal dictatorships, totalitarian regimes, and arrogant empires. From the oppression implied in the Tower of Babel story to the slavery of Pharaonic Egypt, and from Achashverosh to Nebuchadnezzar, the Bible critiques the politics of absolute power and the penchant of dictators to lord over the Jewish people.
None of these empires lasted too long. And none of these bad actors were able to destroy the physical core and indomitable spirit of the Jewish people.
I see this as a warning to the Islamic Republic of Iran - the most acute wannabe totalitarian hegemon of our times; and to the United Nations or the United States of America - who seek to dictate diplomatically to the modern State of Israel. You cannot succeed.
Concurrently, this is a message of reassurance to Jews and Israelis as to how we must view our challenges. The ambitions of Iran for a global Islamic empire are ephemeral, and so are the pretensions to power of extreme ""progressives"" in Red-Green intersectionality alliances who are currently savaging Israel. They will not prevail.
Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks wrote that: ""Judaism is the unique attempt to endow events with meaning, and to see in the chronicles of mankind something more than a mere succession of happenings - to see them as nothing less than a drama of redemption in which the fate of a nation reflects its loyalty or otherwise to a covenant with God.""
Thus, Jews and Israelis should understand their current strategic straits as ordained trials meant to be tackled with wisdom and bravery, even defiance. We can and should confront the current attacks with confidence in the power of Jewish history.
We should go forward with the knowledge that the Jewish people and the State of Israel are not alone, even though it certainly feels so at the current moment. As Rabbi Yehoshua Weitzman of the Galilee has taught (with his phrase becoming the key line of a currently popular Israeli song): ""The Eternal People is not afraid of long journeys.""
AS FOR the current moment, it indeed seems, alas, that Israel's leaders need to take a strong dose of defiance with their morning coffee. The world seems hell-bent on emasculating Israel, preventing Israel from achieving its necessary and justified war goals of crushing Hamas and restoring Israel's regional deterrent power.
The emasculation begins with ""small"" matters like insisting that Israel's ""primary goal"" must be the provision of humanitarian aid to an enemy population in wartime, which is an absurdity never broached before in the history of wars.
It continues with deference to the evil regime in Qatar which bankrolls and fronts for Hamas. Unbelievably, Washington is now thinking of contracting out the construction and operation of its new humanitarian aid port pier in Gaza to a Qatari company. (Then Iranian and Turkish ships can dock and deliver ""aid,"" i.e., weapons and terror tunnel rebuilding supplies, to Hamas freely.)
It continues further with American and European insistence that the necessary next stage of the Israeli military campaign to rout out Hamas, in Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor, is ""unacceptable,"" a ""red line that must not be crossed."" The Biden administration, in particular, outrageously thinks that it can micromanage IDF operations from now on, house-by-house, bullet-by-bullet; handcuffing Israel and driving it into another disastrous draw against Hamas.
The debilitation of Israel continues yet still with arrogant talk of unilaterally recognizing Palestinian statehood and anointing the duplicitous and decrepit Palestinian Authority as a stabilizing force in Gaza - insane, immoral ideas that seed the likelihood of long-term strategic defeat for Israel.
Then there is the new threat of denying arms and munitions to Israel, from spare jet parts to artillery shells. Canada owns the shame of being the first Western country to explicitly declare such a boycott even as Israel fights for its life against a clearly genocidal enemy (Hamas) and prepares to take on yet another (Hezbollah).
The Washington of US President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken (and US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, oy) seems to be not too far away from this too, although its arms choke hold on Israel is at the moment more subtle and implicit than public.
And on a broader level, Washington is kowtowing yet again to Iran, unlocking last week upwards of $10 billion in frozen funds for the ayatollahs. This is an Obama administration reflex deeply embedded in Biden's team that still seeks a grand regional deal with Tehran at Israel's expense (and that of Israel's Gulf Arab allies).
Instead of seriously striking at Iran and its proxies (like the Houthis) and countering the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-controlled Shi'ite crescent running from the Arabian (""Persian"") Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, or doing anything substantial to halt Iran's race to nuclear weapons, the Biden administration seems obsessed with thwarting the supposedly malign influence and hegemonic ambitions - of Israel.
In the face of these deleterious developments, Israel obviously must continue to dialogue with leaders in Western capitals to reach understandings where possible, but also be prepared to defy them when necessary.
Finishing off Hamas and maintaining long-term control of a security envelope including Judea, Samaria, and Gaza is an essential goal that justifies Israeli defiance of the world. The State of Israel does not shrink from long and knotty journeys.

The happy Israeli: Myth or fact?

Talk about counterintuitive.
The UN issued its annual World Happiness Report on Wednesday, and Israel again ranked exceptionally high, earning the title this year of the fifth happiest country in the world (down a single notch from last year).
Every year since 2012, the UN has issued these reports, and every year since 2012 Israel is way up there in the rankings. Every year as well, Israelis ask themselves after hearing about the report: ""Are they talking about us? Can't be.""
Not only Israelis have that reaction. Here's how CNN reported the news on its website on Wednesday: ""Given the war with Hamas, Israel may come as a surprise at No. 5.""
One can't really blame CNN for that framing. With Israel at war after having just experienced the single bloodiest day in Jewish history since the Holocaust, with 134 of its citizens being held hostage in Gaza, with tens of thousands of people evacuated from their homes, with hundreds of thousands of reservists and their families feeling the effects of extended and grueling army duty, Israel these days does not seem synonymous with ""happy.""
Not only these days. Even before October 7, with the country roiling from the judicial overhaul debate and protests and in the midst of a mini-wave of terror attacks, the country did not exactly feel like Disneyland.
Yet, year after year, the UN issues these reports, and year after year, Israel is right up there with the happiest Nordic countries in the rankings. (Finland has led the list for the last seven consecutive years.)
In America, there is a folk saying that describes the dissonance between how things are and how they feel: ""If things are so good, why do I feel so bad""?
In Israel, at least according to the UN report, that saying should be flipped: ""If things are so bad, why do I feel so good.""
WHY, INDEED?
First of all, according to David Leiser, a professor of social psychology and dean of behavioral sciences at Netanya Academic College, the report is misnamed. What it ranks is not happiness - which is a fleeting emotion - but rather life satisfaction. One can be satisfied overall with life, even if, at present, one is not feeling jump-for-joy happiness.
The study is based on the Gallup World Poll, which asked respondents to evaluate their current life using the image of a ladder, with the best possible life a 10 and the worst possible being zero.
""This is not about whether you are having a difficult time right now, it is not related to how happy you felt yesterday, or what bad experiences you had. We are talking really not about happiness but satisfaction with life,"" he said.
""That is something different, because if you feel that your life is meaningful, you may have all kinds of issues and still feel that your life is satisfying. Consider even the case of someone very ill and about to die. If you ask that person, 'What do you think about your life?' he may say, 'I had a full and fulfilling life, but now I have to go.'""
Leiser said that since October 7, the degree of happiness in Israel has been obviously low -just look at the somber mood as the country enters the Purim holiday on Saturday night - but that does not detract from life satisfaction.
Or, as Edith Zakai-Or, the CEO of the Maytiv Center for Positive Psychology at Reichman University, said, it is essential to differentiate between how a person feels at a certain point in time and how they view life in general.
""When my sons were both serving during this war - one in Gaza and the other up North - I wasn't that happy. But I was able to distinguish between not being happy at a certain point because I was very, very worried, and understanding that I have a good life.""
According to Zakai-Or, there are several reasons why people in Israel say they are happier than people elsewhere whose countries face fewer ""horrible challenges.""
""First of all, one of the things that make people happier in Israel is connecting to meaning. And in Israel, there are many opportunities to connect to something that is greater than yourself. There is a lot of ideology around here. We are here for a reason.""
Zakai-Or said this sense of meaning makes people happy ""because when you feel that you are doing something for the greater good, it makes you happy.""
Religion, Leiser said, is also a factor in life satisfaction. He said that Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics' studies consistently show that the more people are religious, the more they say they are happy. ""This is rock solid and has been going on for many, many years,"" he said.
""It's not a matter of whether you believe in the God hypothesis; that's not the point,"" he asserted. ""But if you live in a religious community, or if you live in a community in Samaria, you have a great deal of community support."" You are not isolated, he said.
Zakai-Or said the sense of being a part of a community, of not being alone, of having someone to lean on, and of being connected to family and friends is a major factor in explaining Israeli happiness despite all the country's issues.
""In Israel, if you don't go to a Shabbat dinner, it is a crisis in the family. So there's always someone that you are connected to. And this is a great source of happiness and of resilience. Because you know there is someone who cares about you.""
Further, she said, friendships in Israel are often deep and intense, especially those forged in the army, increasing happiness.
""When you have profound life experiences, like serving with your friends in a war, and you know that your lives depend on each other, it's a friendship forever. I see my father and his friends from the army from the wars in 1967 and 1973. They are like family. They still get together.
""Many Israelis have a much wider family than their genetic family because they create friendships that are as good as family and sometimes even better, and that is a major part of happiness.""
Israel's abundant challenges, she added, do not necessarily diminish happiness, but instead could enhance it.
""When you have no challenges, then something inside you doesn't grow,"" she said. ""Here we are challenged all the time, and we have succeeded. We grow, and this is also a part of being happy.""
How so?
""Because when you feel that you have coped well with a challenge, and that you grew from it, that makes you proud. It gives you a sense of self-confidence, it makes you happier.""
According to Zakai-Or, ""saying that you are happy doesn't mean you're not challenged, afraid, or concerned. They all come together. The fact that you're happy doesn't mean that you don't have other emotions as well. They live together pretty well. People are very sophisticated creatures.""
THE STUDY, said Anat Fanti, a researcher in happiness policy at the Science, Technology, and Society program at Bar-Ilan University, does have questions about emotions - positive emotions and negative emotions - but these are placed in one of the appendices and not factored into the final ""happiness"" ranking.
Fanti said that one reason Israel ranked so high this year despite the war-the poll was taken in Israel after October 7 - is that the score is an average of the last three years to minimize the impact of one cataclysmic effect.
If the results had been based only on data from 2023, she said, Israel would have been ranked 19 out of 143 countries, not No. 5. But this, too, she acknowledged, is ""incredible"" given everything the country is going through right now and has gone through over the last three years. It is especially impressive considering that the UK is ranked this year at 20 and the US at 23.
Despite Israel's enormous challenges and despite complaining being a national pastime, ""things are not so bad in Israel,"" she asserted. ""When you ask people how satisfied they are with their lives, they look at their family, their homes, their jobs, their friends and they say, 'Hey, our lives here are not bad.'""
Fanti said a powerful sense of shared destiny is also a significant factor in satisfaction.
""I always say to non-Jews whom I meet - research colleagues and people I meet at conferences - who ask me if I am religious, because the research shows that religious people are usually happier all over the world, that I am completely secular. I then tell them that although I am completely secular, I feel Jewish, and I cannot disown being Jewish because I carry my family history on my shoulders.
""You never forget that as an Israeli,"" she said. ""You never forget it. People ask questions about my history: where my mother and father were from, where my grandparents were, who survived and who didn't. We all have those histories. You carry all those generations on your shoulders. You are not alone in the world.""
But how, she is asked, does that add to a person's happiness or satisfaction?
""Because you feel you have a reason,"" she said. ""You feel you have purpose in your life here.""

The ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus once noted: ""In war, truth is the first casualty."" His words still ring true today. In the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, media outlets have repeatedly scrambled to amplify baseless allegations against Israel, even when they come from Hamas, a designated terrorist group devoted to Israel's destruction.
On October 7, 2023, Hamas initiated this current war when it invaded Israel, murdered 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, torturing many of their victims. Today, the terror group still holds over 130 people hostage.
Despite Hamas's disregard for morality, many reputable outlets continue to amplify the terrorist group's figures and claims. First, media outlets claimed that Israel bombed Gaza's Al Ahli Hospital, killing 500. It later turned out the hospital was not hit by an Israeli strike, but rather an Islamic Jihad misfire.
Later, the media rushed to report that IDF soldiers had killed 112 Palestinians at a food convoy, forging the tale of the ""Bread Massacre."" An IDF investigation has since concluded that the deaths were overwhelmingly the result of an unprovoked stampede. Then, media outlets platformed allegations accusing Israeli soldiers of rape during their latest counter-terrorism operation in the Al Shifa Hospital. That lie was also revealed to have been fabricated in order to incite fury.
A new dangerous allegation dually incubated by the United Nations agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry has been repeated in major headlines. It claims that ""more children have been killed [in Gaza] in recent months than in four years of conflict worldwide.""
This latest horrific allegation couldn't be further from the truth and dangerously revives the age-old antisemitic blood libel, which has long sought to portray ""the Jews"" as child killers. As it advances antisemitism, the current baseless claim being circulated by the UN and media outlets alike also erases the victims of human rights abuses around the world, while throwing a lifeline to one of its greatest perpetrators - Hamas. This false allegation must be dispelled immediately.
THE UN has a long history of bias against Israel. Its General Assembly and Human Rights Council have exhausted over half of all recent condemnatory resolutions against Israel. Reportedly, 2,135 UNRWA employees belong to Hamas, and about 400 participated in the October 7 massacres.
Biases aside, the numbers upon which the relief agency relies for its latest allegation against Israel do not make sense. Prof. Abraham Wyner, a statistics and data science professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, rejected the casualty figures provided by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.
""The numbers are not real,"" Wyner noted. ""The first place to look is the reported 'total' number of deaths. The graph of total deaths [as reported by the Gaza Health Ministry] by date is increasing with almost metronomical linearity."" Such an even and linear increase suggests the same number of people were killed each day during the beginning of the war in October as during the weeklong ceasefire in November.
Even when taking Hamas's statistics at face value, UNRWA's latest claim falters. Between 2020 and 2022, Ethiopia endured a devastating conflict as its government fought Tigray rebels in a war that fueled humanitarian disaster and famine. An estimated 300,000 to 400,000 civilians died as result of the Tigray War and the humanitarian catastrophe that accompanied it. The median age of Ethiopian citizens is 18.8 years. This means that there would have been 180,000 to 200,000 child deaths, accounting for roughly half of all civilian deaths - a figure that currently exceeds Hamas's entire reported death toll for Gaza by roughly six times.
While every civilian casualty is a tragedy, it should also be noted that at least 13,000 of those killed in Gaza were Hamas operatives, according to the IDF. This sum accounts for more than a third of all deaths currently being reported by Hamas and its propaganda.
WHY UNRWA is propagating false allegations based upon Hamas statistics is a worthwhile question. The agency's very-own chief Philippe Lazzarini invoked the statistic in his recent call for a ceasefire. It is likely others have followed his lead as they desperately seek to prevent Israel from invading Rafah and ridding Gaza's last Hamas-stronghold of their terrorists.
UNRWA and Hamas's latest allegation is as dangerous as it is dishonest, playing into classical antisemitic tropes. For millennia, antisemites wrongly accused Jews of killing children. The original blood libel - which accused Jews of killing Christian children - served as ""a major theme in Jewish persecution in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern period."" It provoked anti-Jewish riots and massacres.
Today, Jewish communities are being targeted by assailants and mobs as an illogical result of similar misinformation targeting the Jewish state and Jews in Israel.
These lies are nothing new. In 1929, Hajj Amin Al Husseini, who is often regarded as the father of Palestinian nationalism, accused Jews during Ramadan of trying to destroy al-Aqsa Mosque. The lies were baseless but resulted in massacres of Jews in Hebron and Jerusalem as many followed his rallying call to ""save"" al-Aqsa. Similar lies also motivated Hamas's October 7 massacres, known in Arabic as Operation al-Aqsa Storm.
It's time for such dangerous lies to stop, or at least not be parroted by journalists who care about their reliability.
The latest myth promoted by Hamas and the UN against Israel is not only recklessly false, but erases victims of human rights abuses around the world as it throws a lifeline to Hamas.
Further, misinformation and disinformation about the war against Hamas have undoubtedly contributed to rising antisemitism, with US incidents having skyrocketed by 400% since October 7. For the sake of their own credibility and for victims of antisemitism worldwide, reputable media outlets must dispel this claim immediately.

Unlike Hamas, Israel seeks to avoid multifront war

Hamas official Osama Hamdan, based in Lebanon, told the Hezbollah-linked Al-Manar this week that ""the battlefield is not confined to Gaza"" and that Hamas's goal is to create a multifront threat to Israel.
Hamas has sought to increase its power in Lebanon, and Hezbollah has allowed Hamas to threaten Israel from there. Meanwhile, Hezbollah has launched thousands of missiles at Israel since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel.
Israel has tried to avoid escalation on the other fronts while concentrating on Gaza. Yet the mere fact that terrorist armies - Hezbollah and Hamas - have generated such a massive threat illustrates just how much they have grown over the last decades. Israel, in the old days, was able to confront multiple fronts, like in 1967 and 1973; Israel was not concerned about fighting both Hamas and Hezbollah along with other terrorist groups in the 1990s.
Today, however, Hamas and Hezbollah are stronger. Israel is defeating Hamas battalions in Gaza, but it is doing so slowly, and there are growing concerns that Hamas is trying to regroup in northern Gaza, necessitating raids into Shifa, Zeitoun, and Shati.
Hamdan said that Israel is facing an ""extensive resistance front,"" referencing threats to Israel from Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and other places. He said Israel has not met its objectives.
Of course, a terrorist official would say these types of things; Hamdan's propaganda doesn't have to be taken at face value. However, it is worth considering because it reflects what the Iranian-backed axis thinks.
""After 163 days, the resistance is still capable in the field battle,"" Hamdan said. He also wants to exploit internal divisions in Israel, saying that ""all eyes are on the next elections in the occupied territories,"" with ""planning underway for the post-Netanyahu era."" Hamas has sought to take advantage of these domestic issues in the past; launching Oct. 7 was a key part of that plan.
Meanwhile, other countries are monitoring what happens in Gaza. Al-Ain media in the Gulf ran an article closely examining whether Hamas is trying to regroup in the enclave.
The report asserts that Israel will continue to redeploy troops, but overall, the Israeli footprint will be small. It also noted that Israel had not devised a day-after plan. All of this appears to indicate concerns in the Gulf. While they may quietly want Hamas defeated, they hope to see a clear victory, not ""stagnation,"" which, the article says, is concerning to them.
These reports, as well as others, lead to questions about the conflict that Israel faces on various fronts and ""arenas."" Iran has sought to unite the arenas and has been partially successful. It still faces challenges because Hezbollah did not fully enter the war. However, Hezbollah's rocket fire forced Israel to evacuate parts of the north, which was an unprecedented decision.
What this means is that Israel's attempt to focus on one front and not get distracted by the Houthi attacks or dragged into a major war with Hezbollah still leaves question marks about what comes next. Iran has sought to exploit this multifront conflict, and it's not clear if Iran's policy is a low-level threat in which it can dictate the level of threat as much as it wants, heating various fronts when it chooses to.
So far, Iran has been able to keep this up for five months, which is more than Israel's enemies achieved in 1967, in 1973, or in any other conflicts. What this means is that Iran has advanced its pawns closer to Israel and gambled on Israel's proportionate responses.
For some commentators, Israel's response in Gaza has been a phenomenal success and a quick victory in a complex urban battlefield. The big question is whether Iran sees it the same way. The propaganda from Iran and its proxies indicates that it is not ready to concede.

Are anti-government protests helping Hamas?

Since Sunday, masses converged in Jerusalem for four days of protests, calling for the return of hostages and against the government in the lead-up to the Knesset's scheduled spring recess that began on Wednesday.
With the return of the broad anti-government protests, those saying that the demonstrations are helping Hamas and Israel's enemies by making Israel seem weak and divided have also returned. We've heard it from politicians and leaders, from people on the streets, and from our friends, but as the adage goes, these people are fighting the last war.
We are unlikely ever to know the effect of the pre-October 7 protests on the Hamas attack. Regardless of these possible influences, post-October 7, the cracks in Israeli society have already been shown, and no amount of ""unity"" will convince Israel's enemies that this togetherness extends beyond the superficial.
Israel has an emergency unity government, which is temporary almost by definition. The haredi draft bill is casting a spotlight on the fact that only part of Israeli society is tasked with its defense, and polls show that the people overwhelmingly do not have faith in the government. No amount of Beyachad Nenatzeach (""Together We Will Win"") stickers will make these issues disappear.
The question of whether or not the protest movement drove Israel to an existential crisis by threatening to leave its defense systems was answered on October 7, when protesters showed up for IDF reserve duty en masse.
We are already at war; the terror organizations and countries that seek to destroy us already know about the disagreements rocking this country. This is the war that we have already lost. The war we must turn to now, if we want to appear as a single front to our enemies, is the war for a country that is healed, whose society is unified or at least knows how to live together. The only way to do this is to tackle the social issues that we've been kicking down the road for decades.
This is what the protesters seek to do. There are numerous ways to fight for and work for a better society, and protesting is certainly one of them.
It is also far from obvious that the protests were divisive. What many of those calling the protests divisive mean is that they do not agree with what the protesters are saying, but how much you agree with a statement is not a measure of divisiveness. The protest movement has united a vast cross-section of Israeli society from multiple geographic and political corners of the country. Protests brought the hawkish army-veteran group Brothers in Arms together in coalitions with left-wing, anti-war protesters calling for peace and an ""end to occupation."" This coalition building and work in the name of common goals, despite deep differences, is exactly the type of work Israeli society must do.
The protests also lent Israel essential credibility in the eyes of the world, which it needs if it wants global legitimacy to fight the Israel-Hamas war. Moody's, in its downgrade of Israel's credit rating, took very positive note of the protests, saying that they provided strong checks and balances. The V-Dem Institute's 2024 Democracy Report removed Israel's categorization as a liberal democracy for the first time in 50 years, in part due to ""government attacks on the judiciary."" This attack was mostly countered by protests. European coverage of Israeli protests showed a side of Israel not often spoken about there - the liberal side, fighting for equal rights for all. The Israeli media took notice of this change in coverage, showcasing European headlines about Israel as a liberal democracy. Israel's standing in the world as a credible liberal democracy is vital to ensuring the continued support of its allies in the war against Hamas.
Those who say that the protests are hurting the war effort are also leaving out an important part of the story. For the first days and even weeks of the war, evacuees and other victims of the Hamas attack expressed the sentiment that the government was nowhere to be found. Israel's civil society stepped in almost immediately to provide help. Within two days, the main protest coalition formed a civilian ""war room,"" which supplied everything from clothing, food, and shelter to evacuees to food, uniforms, and tactical gear to soldiers. Thousands of volunteers collected and purchased gear, while thousands more drove this gear around the country to soldiers and civilians in the North and South. This unbelievably quick mobilization could not have happened without the pre-existing structure and networks that the protesters had formed.
The idea that the protests are hurting the war effort or helping Hamas is a nice one if you don't want protests or the changes they might bring or if you don't agree with what the protesters are saying, but that doesn't mean that this talking point, no matter how many times it is repeated, is true. True unity comes with the acceptance of opinions other than our own and the right of those who hold them to free speech and protest.

Today is the beautiful spectacle of Purim in Jerusalem. While all other cities - those that are not walled cities as Jerusalem is and as Shushan was in the Book of Esther - celebrated yesterday, our Holy city is different. It is special.
Just as our city is unique, so, too, did the Jewish people reveal themselves to be a unique community unlike any other, in the Book of Esther.
While Haman wanted to eradicate the Jewish people for not prostrating before him, our people's faith told them that they are not to bow down before anyone but their one true God and that any demand of such a sort is an abominable act of hubris.
Indeed, the story of Purim tells of King Ahasuerus, who had taken to wife Queen Esther of the Jewish people and niece of Mordechai. Haman, a high-ranking official in the king's court, demanded that the people of the kingdom - ""from Hodu and until Cush"" - bow before him, but Mordechai refused to do so, leading to Haman's wicked campaign against the Jews.
Our people are stubborn folk, it is true. But that stubbornness then, as it is today, is the basis of our insistence to take the right path, the humane path, despite all the pressures that surround us.
Israel is facing that very pressure today: to bow in the face of terror, to surrender to hate. Here, too, we are threatened - and, indeed, fell victim to - a murderous rampage.
When October 7 occurred, there was an influx of support for the Israeli people, and we needed it - though, of course, more than anything, we needed our victims and hostages back. But from October 8 and on, that support began to shift.
Slowly but surely, the global narrative began to sympathize - not with the Palestinian people, who are suffering under the oppressive and hateful regime of the terrorist organization Hamas - but with the terrorists themselves. They called it ""justified retaliation.""
The pressure, then, was on Israel not to retaliate after so many were murdered, butchered, raped, set aflame, kidnapped, made to dress like dolls, starved, and tortured.
Like the Jews who refused to bow before an evil monarch, the Jews today refuse to bow in the face of terrorists. In both cases, our people were (and are) facing an existential threat. Then, it was Haman's decree to kill the Jewish people in the kingdom; today, it is that same threat here in Israel.
In the megillah, Esther and Mordechai pursue diplomatic means to prevent the slaughter of their people. Esther hosts banquets for the very people attempting to murder her people in a carefully concocted plan to save their lives, even if it means putting her own at risk.
Ultimately, however, the king's decree could not be undone, just as the horrors Israel faced on October 7 could not be undone. They did, however, manage to make it so that the Jewish people were permitted to defend themselves.
That is what the Israel-Hamas war ultimately comes down to; it is a war in the pursuit of self-defense.
In the Book of Esther, the Jewish response to those acting violently against them due to Haman's order was careful. It required violence, yes, but only as self-defense aimed at neutralizing the threat.
This, too, is how Israel must continue to operate in the Gaza Strip. If this war goes on, it must be done to target those who threaten our statehood and our people and nothing more. This has been Israel's pursuit all along, and it is Israel's responsibility to hold any soldiers not operating per this command accountable.
Today, the Jewish people celebrate. We fasted and fought, and that is what allowed our people to exist for so long. Today, as well, as our nation is at war, we must remember those same principles that carried Queen Esther and her uncle Mordechai down their paths; even when it feels as though the entire world is against us, we must rally together, united, to defend our people.
As Golda Meir said, ""We have no place else to go.""

The Israel-Hamas war is being fought by the IDF to release the hostages taken during the October 7 massacre, ensure that such a pogrom can never happen again, and secure justice against the perpetrators. The physical battlefield is not the only arena in which these objectives can be achieved - the courtroom is also a vital front in the war against terrorism.
""Israel is fighting this war on multiple fronts, not only against Hamas in Gaza but in the 'war of narratives' and the legal arena as well,"" Human Rights lawyer and International Legal Forum CEO Arsen Ostrovsky said.
""It is imperative that we are unwavering in using every legal tool at our disposal to change the paradigm in pursuing justice by holding not only the perpetrators of October 7 accountable but all those who supported, enabled, and funded this massacre and ongoing captivity of hostages.""
Ostrovsky and his coalition of thousands of attorneys are among the many actors who have taken the fight to the courtroom. Since October 7, NGOs, activists, survivors, and the families of victims have sought justice and the prevention of future horrors, by filing lawsuits against those who facilitated Hamas's crimes.
At the end of January, 67 US and Israeli October 7 victims filed a lawsuit with a US federal court, seeking restitution from Iran as a sponsor of Gazan terrorist organizations. On February 14, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Hamas for genocide, kidnapping, sexual violence, and torture. Additionally, on behalf of family members and victims, the National Jewish Advocacy Center (NJAC) and several firms, on February 23, sued the Associated Press (AP) before the Southern District of Florida for allegedly knowingly supporting terrorism by purchasing photos from Hamas-linked journalists, including Gazans who participated in the October 7 massacre.
NJAC also worked with ILF and attorneys David Schoen and Ben Schlager to file a suit in Alabama on behalf of October 7 victims against cryptocurrency platform Binance, for facilitating Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) funding and financial transactions.
Representatives of the parents of Shani Louk, May Naim, Lotan Abir, Guy Gabriel Levi, and Shalev Madmoni filed a lawsuit in the Jerusalem District Court on February 28 against AP and Reuters for their employment of photo-journalists who accompanied the terrorists on their pogrom.
In another suit on behalf of victims, Schoen, attorneys David Finger and Jason Torchinsky, NJAC, and ILF launched a March 10 Delaware lawsuit against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) USA National Committee, for alleged support of Hamas.
The Shurat Hadin-Israel Law Center also filed a lawsuit in Jerusalem, on March 11, on behalf of 124 family members of October 7 victims, against the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas. Shurat Hadin founder Nitsana Darshan-Leitner said the barrage of such lawsuits can serve to cut off the financial oxygen that terrorist organizations need to breathe.
""If you block the flow of the money, you can block the flow of the terrorism, and the only way to do so is by bringing legal actions against the terror organizations and their financial patrons,"" said Darshan-Leitner.
""The players in this fight are the terror victims who were harmed as a result of terror attacks. They are seizing billions of dollars of terror funds, and putting liens on hundreds of millions of dollars of terror assets. This fight grants the terror victims a way to fight back. Money cannot bring back life, but money gives a measure of closure, a measure of justice to the terror victims. In Shurat HaDin we've been fighting terror funding for two decades and we'll continue to do it until we dry all the sources for their money.""
As noted by Darshan-Leitner, such legal efforts on behalf of terrorism victims are part of a long war against terrorists.
Richard Heideman has been fighting on the frontlines of this battle for decades. Heideman hasn't just served as ex-president of the American Zionist Movement and B'nai B'rith International and founding chairman of The Israel Forever Foundation, he is also senior counsel for the DC law firm, Heideman Nudelman & Kalik, PC. Over several decades, the firm has frequently been asked to represent the victims of terrorism.
""Terrorism didn't begin with October 7 or the Second Intifada or September 11,"" said Heideman.
He explained that there are two alternate but not competing paths when pursuing legal action and justice for terrorism victims: Action against states and action against non-state actors.
Normally, states do not fall under the jurisdiction of US courts, but under the terrorism exception in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, any country designated by the US State Department as a State Sponsor of Terrorism can be sued by American victims. The current list includes Syria, Iran, North Korea, and Cuba. Spouses, children, parents, and siblings of terror victims all have claims against these countries, said Heideman.
Libya used to be on the list but was removed in 2006 after a series of agreements with the United States and United Kingdom, which included settlements for litigation against it for support of terrorism.
Heideman also served as counsel for victims of the 1985 EgyptAir Flight 648 hijacking, after three Palestinian Abu Nidal terrorists seized the flight from Athens to Cairo, diverting it to Malta. They separated Americans, Israelis, Europeans, and Australians, putting them at the front of the plane. Sixty hostages, including an American, were killed during a shootout with Egyptian special forces. Heideman said that a surviving terrorist told him that he had received the weapons through a Libyan diplomat and that they had trained in the Beqaa Valley. Heideman worked on the suit against Libya and Syria.
That same year, terrorists simultaneously attacked the El Al ticket counters in Rome and Vienna. In Rome, Americans waiting at the Trans World Airlines (TWA) counter were killed. Heideman served as counsel to some of the American victims. He spoke to terrorists in prison, who gave affidavits stating that the attack was sponsored by Libya and that they had been trained by Syrian intelligence along with the flight 648 terror cell. As part of Libya's claims settlement agreement that Heideman worked on, Libya, in 2008, settled with $1.5 billion, dispersed to victims of those attacks.
This demonstrates that while it may take decades of work, judgments against rogue states such as Syria can eventually yield fruit. Yet because victims and their families can't wait decades for financial and emotional relief, Heideman said, in 2014 the US Congress created the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund for American claimants to be awarded according to court judgments.
THE OTHER path for suing those supporting terrorist activities is through the Anti-Terrorism Act as amended by the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, allowing victims to sue NGOs, corporations, banks, charities, and foundations for material support in aiding and abetting terrorism. Heideman said that such cases can be difficult since they require proof of the use of funding in terrorism and prior knowledge that the funds would be used in such a capacity. Under the Alien Tort Statute, foreign citizens can bring lawsuits before American courts.
Heideman took part in legal action against Arab Bank in 2018 when it was accused of facilitating Hamas terrorist attacks by knowingly providing funds to Hamas through charities. The bank settled. Heidman said that one of the terrorists who received funds through Arab Bank was Tamer Rimawi, an alleged al-Aqsa Martyr's Brigades terrorist who murdered special-needs kindergarten teacher Esther Klieman in 2002. On behalf of her family, Heidman sued the PA, Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and then Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The case has gone on for years as the PA and PLO have contested jurisdiction, demanding the case be tried in Ramallah.
The slaughter of so many people on October 7 shocked Heideman, who visited the towns that had been attacked.
""Americans, Israelis, and the citizens of 42 other countries deserve to seek and obtain justice,"" he said. ""Our firm has been engaged to litigate against Iran and Syria for providing aid to Hamas.""
Heideman said that they had already consulted with experts who were willing to opine to the court that Hamas was sponsored by Iran - and had engaged a number of investigators to collect more information on material and funding support.
As a general rule, judges look to precedent in their decision-making, and if a court has accepted research findings, they can be applied to other cases. Heideman pointed to the case of Eitan and Naama Henkin who were murdered by a Hamas cell in 2015. He represented Naama's side of the family against Syria, Iran, and Iranian military and financial bodies for their support of the Hamas terrorist attack, resulting in a judgment in their favor.
Heideman is also co-counsel representing the mother, father, wife, children, and most of the siblings of Ari Fuld, who was murdered by a terrorist in 2018. The family is also suing Iran and Syria in a pending case.
""We anticipate we will be engaged for many years with the multiple legal actions we will be launching"" over October 7, said Heideman.
The attorney said that his firm was looking at different non-state entities operating in Qatar and anticipated taking action over UNRWA-related issues. Heideman has been in contact with the families of soldiers killed or injured during IDF service. He had previously represented the family of American-born IDF soldier Max Steinberg, who was killed in Gaza during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge. They successfully sued Iran for providing material support to his killers, Heideman said.
Many avenues remain open to possibility in the war on terrorism, and in the legal realm, warriors like Ostrovsky, Darshan-Leitner, and Heideman are intent on pursuing victories.
""Israel is not only taken to task on the battlefield and the diplomatic front, Israel and the Jewish people face a continuing battle of public opinion and we hope that our quest for truth and justice will help not only pursue the guilty but protect the good name of Israel,"" said Heideman.
""Justice, justice, you shall pursue (Deuteronomy 16:20),"" he concluded.

Hamas hospitals and int'l humanitarian law

The safety of hospitals and medical facilities in Gaza became a central theme during the Israel-Hamas war. As the famous Erich Maria Remarque quote goes, ""a hospital alone shows what war is.""
The first controversy came early in the war with the false allegations about IDF bombing of the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza city, an incident which Hamas claimed led to the death of 500 people. Shortly after, it was proved that a failed Hamas rocket had hit the parking lot of the hospital, and, as recognized by Human Rights Watch, the number of casualties was highly exaggerated. Since then, the World Health Organization (WHO) has asserted that 187 medical facilities were impacted by the hostilities, 24 of which are hospitals.
The impact on hospitals and medical facilities usually comes from either deploying fire-power or in conducting investigations related to suspected misuse of the hospital by Hamas, and in search of the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza (the current number, hard to fathom, stands at 136 people).
Israel asserts (and has shown proof) that Hamas uses hospitals for command and control as well as the tunnels below them for sheltering weapons and terrorists, instigating attacks, and detaining Israeli hostages (as shown in footage from Shifa, when illegally kidnapped persons were brought to the hospital). This is a recurring issue between Israel and Hamas, exemplified by Amnesty International's 2014 findings of evidence of hospital misuse by Hamas during Operation Protective Edge.
Hospitals and medical facilities are sacred under international humanitarian law. The protection of hospitals goes back to early documents such as the 1874 Brussels Declaration, and has been reaffirmed in all meaningful legal instruments adopted since then (notably, the Hague Regulations and the Geneva Conventions). Both sides to the conflict are obligated to safeguard hospitals - Hamas should not misuse them and Israel should not attack them.
This protection, however, is not an absolute one. When a hospital is misused it loses protection temporarily, and a party to conflict can either operate in it or even attack it in order to safeguard its soldiers and to neutralize a possible risk it faces.
We should differentiate between two scenarios. When a hospital is misused by Hamas to hide weapons, or to detain hostages, the IDF has a right to operate and investigate in that hospital. The second scenario is one that involves an actual attack coming from the hospital, namely a direct threat to the lives of the soldiers on the ground (or, in the case of launching rockets at civilians in Israel).
In such a case, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the guardian of the Geneva Conventions, the IDF is entitled to attack the source of risk emanating from the hospital. This right is of a temporary nature, and it must conform with other obligations such as those of proportionality and of precautions against attack (namely, warning civilians and medical staff in advance). The fact that medical staff are, at times, revealed as members of Hamas, makes matters even more complicated.
In order to evaluate actions by the IDF, one cannot take a bird's eye view, rather there is a need to evaluate each and every incident on its own. There needs to be a consideration of evidence presented before the military commander, who evaluates it based on a standard of reasonableness. The IDF will need to show why an investigative operation, or a strike, took place, and thus far it is doing a good job in presenting evidence to the public. The IDF even published an interactive map that includes footage of the misuse of hospitals in Gaza.
The IDF makes strong assertions, especially when it comes to misuse that creates a strategic advantage for Hamas (such as the tunnels), that are currently being accepted by the international community to an extent. But, the real test will be the ""day after"" the resolution of the hostilities. Until then, we will need to wait for the fog of war to disperse in order to truly pass judgment in this matter.

If Israel is 'winning the war,' why are rockets falling?

Gun battles in Gaza, more than 50 rockets launched at Israel in one day, a terror attack in central Israel, and still Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF top brass are boasting of winning the war.
It is too early for the Israeli people to declare victory in the Israel-Hamas war - or even to believe that winning is on the horizon.
Yet our leaders' strongly worded and assuring statements have acted as a balm on Israeli public consciousness, despite the high IDF casualty count and the failure to secure the release of the remaining 136 hostages in captivity in Gaza.
As proof of public sentiment that success is on the horizon, earlier this week the Jewish People's Policy Institute released a survey which revealed that showed nearly eight out of 10 Israelis (78%) believe that Israel will win the war.
When asked what victory looks like, 38% said that Gaza is no longer under Hamas control. Another 25% said that border area residents feel safe returning home. Fourteen percent said if the hostages return home.
SO, IS it almost over? Let's examine the issues.
Hamas resilience: While aerial photos of the Gaza Strip and reports by foreign media show that Israel has damaged or destroyed at least 70% of the buildings and infrastructure in Gaza, Hamas and its top leaders remain alive and well enough underground.
Moreover, despite Israel's flattening of the Gaza skyline, the resilience of the remaining fighters and citizens appears high. They still have enough military power to launch rockets at Israel, and Hamas continues its unyielding ground fight, evident in the daily toll on our soldiers.
According to IDF reports, Hamas has experienced limited losses in terms of key military figures, with only three top military leaders out of 14, two brigade commanders, and 19 battalion commanders eliminated. The army is taking out around 10 to 20 terrorists a day, resulting in approximately 9,000 Palestinian fighters being neutralized since Oct. 7, the IDF said earlier this week.
This figure contrasts with the overall death toll of around 24,000 in the enclave, reported by the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry.
Earlier this week, the spokesperson for Hamas's Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, claimed that ""the enemy's announcements of imaginary achievements regarding rockets and tunnels are a subject of ridicule for us, and the day will come when we prove their falsehood.""
Finally, despite escalating famine and disease threats, the Gazan citizenry has refrained from rebelling against their terror government, a trend likely to persist if the polls prove accurate.
Hostage dilemma: On Monday, Kibbutz Be'eri announced the death in captivity of two hostages connected to its community, adding to the list of around 20 Israeli hostages who have been reported dead with their bodies still in captivity.
With released Israelis' testimonies and videos shared by Hamas - though possibly part of psychological warfare - it is probable that the lives of any remaining hostages are in jeopardy.
""The fate of many prisoners has become unknown during the past weeks,"" Abu Obeida said in his Sunday statement. ""Most likely, many prisoners were killed, and the enemy bears responsibility for their fate.""
Thus far, Israel has rescued only one hostage. Other individuals were released from Gaza during the hostage-prisoner exchange. Since then, Hamas has upped its ante to levels that Israel finds unacceptable.
Israeli media reported that MK Gadi Eisenkot told the war cabinet that Israel had to change tactics if it was to secure the release of the remaining hostages and that ""time is running out."" Despite this, Gallant remains steadfast in advocating the continuation of military pressure.
""If the war ends now, the fate of the hostages will be sealed for many years - in Hamas captivity,"" Gallant said Tuesday.
Border, sea escalations: While Israel pounds Gaza, threats on the northern border by Hezbollah and in the Red Sea by the Houthis are escalating.
This week, a Hezbollah missile killed a mother and her son in Moshav Kfar Yuval. While Israel continues to exchange fire with Lebanon, more than 100,000 residents of the area remain displaced from their homes.
At sea, the Houthis have said ships will continue to be targeted until the attacks on Gaza stop - even if the United States and Britain get involved.
""The Yemeni armed forces will continue to prevent Israeli navigation or those associated with the Israeli enemy in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea until the aggression is stopped and the siege on the steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted,"" the military spokesperson for the Houthis, Yahya Saree, said Tuesday.
West Bank turmoil: The situation in the West Bank is also unstable, with the IDF operating at unprecedented levels since the start of the war, and public sentiment appearing increasingly supportive of Hamas among the local population.
""In Judea and Samaria, we operate around the clock in the communities and along the axes,"" the IDF said in a statement over the weekend. ""During the war, we conducted an unprecedented number of offensive activities and apprehended terrorists, some of whom were on their way to commit terror attacks.""
Since Oct. 7, the IDF has apprehended close to 2,700 wanted Palestinians in the West Bank, with over 1,300 of them having affiliations with Hamas.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization equated the situation in the West Bank with that of Gaza, saying that ""as Israel committed massacres in the Gaza Strip throughout 100 days of war, it continues its attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.
""Through repeated raids and attacks, Israel is hoping people will leave voluntarily,"" Wasel Abu Yousef said.
Terror in Ra'anana: This week marked the first internal terror attack outside Jerusalem since the onset of the war. Two West Bank Palestinians, in Israel illegally, initiated the assault, which involved stabbing Israeli civilians and executing a car-ramming attack in the central city of Ra'anana, according to the Israel Police and several witnesses.
The attack left one older woman dead and more than a dozen wounded, some severely. It also rocked the affluent city, to where many American immigrants moved after making aliyah.
Global backlash: World opinion broadly condemns Israel's efforts to defend itself against the Hamas terrorist regime, with widespread protests on streets and college campuses. Furthermore, Israel is being forced to defend itself in the International Court of Justice against South Africa's allegations that it is committing genocide against the Palestinians.
Flattening buildings, destroying tunnels, and killing Arab terrorists are short-term markers in a field with an unknown and possibly unachievable end goal. The people deserve to be given an accurate timeline by their leaders and a comprehensive understanding of what might be at stake if Israel intends to fulfill the mission it declared on Oct. 7.

We have lost faith in ceasefires

Those who are calling for an end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas have clearly forgotten that there was a ceasefire between the two parties until the morning of October 7, when thousands of terrorists invaded Israel, murdering, beheading, raping, and mutilating hundreds of Israelis. The terrorists also kidnapped more than 240 people, half of whom are still being held hostage in the Gaza Strip.
It was Hamas, not Israel, that breached the ceasefire. This war was not initiated by Israel. The war was imposed on Israel, who had no choice but to remove the terrorist threat from its border with the Gaza Strip. There is a consensus that this is one of the most justified wars since 1948. This is a war to defend our home.
That's why it would be very difficult to find Israelis who support the idea of a ceasefire or a hudna (temporary truce) that will allow Hamas to remain in power. For these Israelis, a ceasefire is tantamount to a Hamas victory. A war that ends without the total destruction of Hamas will be seen by many Arabs as a defeat for Israel and a victory for Iran and its terror proxies, including Hamas.
More than 100 days after the eruption of the war, Hamas leaders are apparently beginning to understand that Israel is more determined than ever to achieve the two goals of the war: ending Hamas' rule over the Gaza Strip and the release of the remaining hostages. They are also finally realizing that this war is different from all the previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Hamas. Those mini-wars were limited in time and always ended in Egyptian and Qatari-brokered ceasefires.
It's safe to assume that as in the past, this time too, Hamas interested in a ceasefire. Hamas, however, wants a permanent ceasefire that would end the war and allow the terrorist group to remain in power. Hamas, in other words, is saying: ""Let's go back to the pre-October 7 era when we had a ceasefire."" Its leaders are no longer talking about a temporary truce. They are so worried that they will lose their grip on the Gaza Strip that are searching for a way to end the war. This is something that Israel cannot afford for a number of reasons.
FIRST, THE Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have still not destroyed most of Hamas' military infrastructure. Second, although nearly 9,000 Hamas members have been killed since the beginning of the war, it is believed that there are still 15,000-20,000 more terrorists operating in different parts of the Gaza Strip. Third, Israel has yet to release the hostages, and it seems that the only way to do so is by stepping up the military pressure.
Hamas is not seeking a ceasefire because it is concerned about the rising number of Palestinian casualties. If it cared about the well-being and safety of the Palestinians, it would not have launched its genocidal attack on Israel. If it cared about its constituents, it would have built bomb shelters for them instead of building tunnels for its leaders.
Recently, senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk stated that ""the underground tunnels built in the Gaza Strip are to protect the Hamas 'fighters' and the responsibility to protect the civilians is with the United Nations and Israel."" Such statements demonstrate the Hamas leaders' indifference towards the suffering of their own people. And we haven't yet talked about the tens of millions of dollars that the terror organization has invested in stockpiling weapons and digging tunnels instead of building schools and hospitals and providing work opportunities.
Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, one of the masterminds of the October 7 massacre, is said to be holding the key to ending the war with Israel. He is the only one who can put an end to the war by releasing all the Israeli hostages and ordering his men to surrender. But Sinwar, who speaks fluent Hebrew, fully understands that this could be his last battle. As someone who is said to follow the news from Israel very closely, he has been hearing the voices of Israelis calling for his elimination.
Nevertheless, he is unlikely to release the hostages unconditionally. Nor is it realistic to expect a psychopath like Sinwar to instruct his Hamas' terrorists to lay down their weapons and hand themselves over to the IDF.
His only hope now is that international pressure will compel Israel to accept an end to the war. American and European officials who repeatedly urge Israel to agree to a ceasefire before it has achieved its goals are actually sending a reassuring message to Sinwar and other Hamas leaders, namely that it is worthwhile holding on for a little longer because Israel will eventually bow to the pressure.
When Hamas sees many Western countries and officials pressing Israel to stop the war, this encourages the terror group to harden its position and come up with even more demands. If until recently it was willing to accept a temporary truce, it is now demanding an absolute end to the war and a full withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza. Moreover, Hamas now has the audacity to demand international guarantees that it will remain in power and that Israel will not target its leaders.
Hence, it's no surprise that Hamas leaders rejected the recent Israeli offer of a two-month lull in the fighting in return for the release of the hostages. Israel, according to the proposal, was even prepared to release a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Still, Hamas reportedly turned down the offer because it is still dreaming of returning to the pre-October 7 status quo.
IT'S ESSENTIAL, too, to understand the broader significance and the possible consequences. Israel cannot afford to stop the war before it restores its deterrence. Since October 7, Israel has been seen as weak and vulnerable. Its enemies are convinced that the countdown to Israel's destruction has begun. A ceasefire without an absolute win over Hamas would send the wrong message to its patrons in Iran, which poses an existential threat to Israel, actively coordinated with its proxies throughout the region: Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the Houthis.
If the international community is truly interested in ending the war in Gaza, it should exert pressure on Hamas, not on Israel. Those who are calling for a ceasefire should at least demand that Hamas, immediately and unconditionally, release all the hostages. They should also demand that the terror group disarm and relinquish its control over the two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. No Israeli will accept a ceasefire or an end to the war that would keep Hamas terrorists a few hundred yards away from their homes and communities.
It seems that the international community has not yet grasped that the Israel of today is not the Israel of October 6. Israelis have learned, the hard way, that truces have a nasty way of blowing up in their faces.

Israel 's surreal reality,"

Israel's surreal reality
Jerusalem Post

Length: 1179 words

There's a prevalent feeling that our reality keeps getting increasingly surreal, unexpected, or strange in ways that we would not normally expect.
For example: the recent announcement by Moody's - one of three major international credit rating agencies - that it had decided to reduce Israel's credit rating from A1 to A2, for the first time. The agency's rationale is that Israel's prolonged war against Hamas will become a significant long-term economic and political burden for the country, not least of all because of the way the current government is managing the situation.
Moody's concluded from this assessment that ""the ongoing military conflict with Hamas, its aftermath, and wider consequences materially raise the political risk for Israel as well as weaken its executive and legislative institutions and fiscal strength, for the foreseeable future"".
Moody's must also be aware that the American financial and diplomatic commitment to Israel does not seem as solid today as it did during the first three months of Israel's war against Hamas. The fact that several weeks ago Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke of the need for Israel to establish self-sufficiency for itself in the manufacture of munitions indicates that he is aware of the risks in this field.
Moody's announcement is viewed by both Netanyahu and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich as politically motivated and surreal, since they both keep speaking of the basic strength of the Israeli economy, despite some current economic setbacks. They consider these to be temporary, and they also cite the updated 2024 budget, which, in their opinion, addresses the issue of Israel's new economic reality seriously.
I am not aware of any recent poll that tried to establish what percentage of the Israeli Jewish population accepts Netanyahu's and Smotrich's persistent reassurances that the Israeli economy is strong and stable, and resistant to Israel's credit rating being reduced. Anyone who has persistently accepted their reassurances considers the current situation that fell upon us last Friday - which might well be followed by the other two credit rating institutions (S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings) following suit - as a surreal development. The surreal reality was that the international credit institutions accepted our leaders' reassurances for four months. Moody's current move is a return to reality.
A SECOND surreal reality concerns the whereabouts and actions taken by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. For four months we were led to believe that Sinwar was hiding in bunkers underground, surrounded by Israeli hostages, but that at the same time he was effectively running Hamas's battles, and making decisions on its behalf.
In the talks for a deal to release the remaining 136 hostages held by Hamas, it was thought that Sinwar was still moving around in underground hiding places, and calling the shots with extreme positions. Now we are being told by anonymous security forces that Sinwar had been cut off from any outside communications since the end of January - either as a tactic to avoid capture or as an authentic breakdown of communications. Either way, who is ""negotiating"" and calling the shots on behalf of Hamas: Sinwar, or the Hamas leaders living in luxury in Qatar?
Another surreal reality is Israel's refusal to address the question of who will run the lives of two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip after the war is over (assuming that they will remain in the area). For that matter, who is responsible for running the lives of the civilian population there today?
Israel complains that whenever it removes its forces from an area in the Gaza Strip (especially in the North), Hamas turns up to distribute part of the humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip from Egypt and Israel. They are also performing pseudo-policing activities and various other services. Israel (primarily Netanyahu) just keeps stating who should not, or will not, run the civilian matters in the Gaza Strip, whether now or in the future - not Hamas, (though it is still there, in a way), not the Palestinian Authority, not UNRWA, and not Israel, which insists only on preserving an effective military presence in the Gaza Strip once the war ends.
Yet another element of our surreal reality is the fact that since the beginning of the war around 250,000 Israelis (including 50,000 toddlers and school children) have been evacuated by the government to hotels in various parts of the country. Some have moved of their own volition from settlements in the North and the Gaza border area in the South because of the ongoing security situation. Since the Israel-Hamas war began, some 350,000 Israelis have been called up, or volunteered, for prolonged reserve military duty.
Some of those displaced have returned to their homes, or have found temporary accommodation away from their permanent residences. Most reservists have been released (at least temporarily - until being called up again) after serving in the Gaza Strip and the North for three to four months. But at least 600,000 persons (around 6% of the total population) have had their everyday lives seriously disrupted. Businesses are in serious financial straits, and jobs have been lost.
In addition, some of these internally displaced people have also experienced horrendous personal tragedies involving murders and abductions of family members and friends by Hamas terrorists. Thousands of reservists are experiencing symptoms of post-trauma at a time when there is a shortage of social workers, psychologists, and other professionals to help them cope. Another surreal reality.
The last surreal reality concerns how the government is coping with some of the country's current acute problems - for example, the IDF's manpower shortage. The IDF is trying to cope with this problem by prolonging the service period of those who serve in mandatory military service and reserve duty.
And who is left out of this whole rigmarole? The haredim, most of whom have never served in the military, and according to the new rules and regulations will not serve in the future either.
Nevertheless, when the question came up in the Knesset plenum regarding why those in pre-military training frameworks - both secular and national religious - should be called up earlier for military service, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant had Meir Porush, minister of Jerusalem Affairs and Heritage (United Torah Judaism), reply on behalf of the Defense Ministry.
Porush's explanation sounded like the epitome of hypocrisy and audacity, coming from a haredi minister - considering that neither he, nor his children, nor grandchildren have served in the military for a single day.
What on earth was Gallant thinking, and when, if ever, shall we return to saner, less surreal days?
The writer worked in the Knesset for many years as a researcher, and has published extensively both journalistic and academic articles on current affairs and Israeli politics. Her most recent book, Israel's Knesset Members - A Comparative Study of an Undefined Job, was published by Routledge.

October 7 marked the greatest crisis in the history of the State of Israel. It could also augur a great opportunity, just as the traumatic Yom Kippur War 50 years ago engendered the peace treaty with Egypt. The United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and other democracies sided with Israel's war on Hamas from day one. Visits by world leaders in the middle of the war to express solidarity; shipments of ammunition; and formation of a coalition against the Houthis are among the prominent expressions of this support by our allies.
But Israel's interest requires another step on the part of our friends, a step that UK Foreign Secretary Cameron and US Secretary of State Blinken have talked about in recent days: recognition of a Palestinian state. For the UK, this would serve as the ultimate realization of the Balfour Declaration, which envisioned a national home for the Jewish people because without a national home for the Palestinian people we will not be a free people in our land. Separation between these two national homes would allow us to maintain Israel as the democratic State of the Jewish people.
Recognizing a Palestinian state would underscore what the international community has been telling Israel for decades: the desired political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is separation into two states. It is incumbent upon the US, UK, and European Union to form a ""coalition of sanity"" against the coalition of extremists. Pro-Western Arab states will join them. The details of the separation will be worked out in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israel, for example, should and will demand that Palestine be demilitarized.
A Palestinian state is recognized by 138 out of 193 countries UN member states. Most did so in 1988 after Palestinian Liberation Organization head Yasser Arafat's landmark Algiers declaration establishing a Palestinian state. In his declaration, the PLO adopted the two-state solution, recognizing Security Council Resolution 242, based on the 1967 lines [calling for the withdrawal of Israel from territory gained in the Six Day War]. Some 30 additional countries recognized the Palestinian state in 2011 after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas applied for UN membership.
However, some 50 states have so far refrained from recognizing a Palestinian state. These are the ""moral majority"" countries, as former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Ron Prosor, called them in 2011, when he tried to convince as many states as possible to abstain from the vote.
In so doing, Israel sought to signal that the ""moral majority"" consisting of the world's major democracies did not support Palestinian membership in the UN. In fact, democracies such as France and Spain joined the bloc of 138 states that voted in favor; Germany and the UK were among the 41 abstentions, and only nine states voted ""nay"", led by the US, the Czech Republic, and Canada.
With Israel under the rule of an extremist government, Israeli citizens should call on the international ""moral majority"" to grant sweeping recognition of a Palestinian state in order to defeat extremism and create a political alternative to Hamas. Standing with Israel and its existential interests requires international leadership to steer the sides toward the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This separation into two states for two peoples will not only grant the Palestinians the right to self-determination - it will also save Israel from the binational catastrophe toward which we are heading.
The US, UK, Canada, and 19 members of the EU, including Germany, France, and Italy, have yet to recognize a Palestinian state, but all maintain diplomatic relations with Ramallah. It should be made clear that recognition of a Palestinian state is essentially a symbolic step. It will not automatically lead to its establishment nor determine its boundaries. It will send a clear signal to the State of Israel and those at its helm of the direction in which the international community is pointing them, after which the Israeli and Palestinian governments themselves will negotiate the details of the separation.
Such a move would encourage the PA to undertake the systemic reforms advocated by the international community, led by the US.
This is the direction desired by our allies for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for normalization with Saudi Arabia, for regional investment and prosperity (for example, the planned economic corridor from India to Europe, running through the Gulf, Jordan, and Israel), and for forming an effective regional anti-Iran coalition.
Such a move would create an ""alliance of moderates"" - the US, UK, the EU, the pro-western Arab countries, and Israel's peace-loving citizens - against the axis of extremists who seek to fuel the conflict, not resolve it.
Broad international recognition of a Palestinian state will signal to the Israeli government the path it must choose - a path of dialogue and understanding that unless it distances itself from the dangerous hardliners advocating transfer and annexation, Israel will become a pariah state, like South Africa's apartheid regime. Israel must choose to play a key role in the emerging world order of liberal democracies, led by the US, UK, and the EU, rather than being relegated to its boycotted margins.
The two-state solution enjoys broad international consensus. The two-state vision is one of the few issues on which the US can agree with Russia and China, which have already recognized a Palestinian state. This consensus can serve as the basis for an international initiative that will turn the tragedy of October 7 into a diplomatic opportunity.
US recognition of a Palestinian state would also have the added value of restoring President Joe Biden's standing among progressive voters, damaged by his unequivocal support for Israel and its war on Hamas. We must not forget the terrible alternative. Donald Trump is a threat to the democratic world. The former president, who pledged to be a dictator ""only for a day,"" may return to the White House unchecked, propped up by fanatical supporters of a man who has proven countless times that he holds his personal interests far dearer than those of his country (like our prime minister).
Recognition by the international ""moral majority"" of a Palestinian state is a Zionist imperative if Israel is to ensure its future as the democratic nation-state of the Jewish people. It would serve as a lifeline against the nightmarish government of Benjamin Netanyahu, Itamar Ben-Gvir, and Bezalel Smotritch, and the world's lifeline against Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Iran's regional influence.
Recognition of a Palestinian state by the world's leading democracies could finally provide more stability and calm to the bruised area in which we live.

Is there a rift in the war cabinet? Debate over the best course of action in Gaza is intensifying

It has been 105 days since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, and over three months since Israel launched its military operation in the Gaza Strip. As the operation transitioned into a new phase - a more precise, tactical strategy with fewer Israeli forces on the ground - it is important to understand what has been accomplished thus far, and what lies ahead for decision-makers. Israel is set on accomplishing its war objectives of dismantling Hamas and returning all Israeli captives, and its leadership has stated that it will not back down before these objectives have been accomplished.
Operational status updates:
The ground operation began in the densely populated northern part of the Gaza Strip, a terror-heavy territory housing two Hamas brigades and 12 battalions, including hundreds of terrorists who committed the massacres of Oct. 7. Israel has made immense efforts to evacuate Gazan civilians from the battle zones to ensure that they will not be used as human shields by Hamas terrorists.
In air raids before the ground entrance, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) targeted terror infrastructure, including hundreds of underground facilities, outlook posts, and rigged buildings, reducing Hamas's capabilities before the ground troops entered. With accurate intelligence and by international law, in the first days of fighting, Israel significantly reduced Hamas' ability to retaliate.
At the onset of the ground offensive, IDF troops successfully encircled the city of Jabalya in northern Gaza, later taking control of Gaza City and the rest of the northern region.
A combined force consisting of over 200 tanks, combat brigades, combat engineering units, and special forces entered the Strip, closely guided by IDF intelligence tracking developments in real-time, providing intel enabling troops to effectively attack and safely maneuver inside the battle zone. Ground troops work in sync with the IAF and military intelligence, with drones, UAVs, and fighter aircraft providing intel from above the ground and striking down targets while using live intel from ground troops for precision strikes.
The close cooperation between the military forces is unprecedented and has been consistent throughout the entire operation. Israel has proven that when its ground troops, air force, navy, and intelligence apparatus work together in sync, it can effectively and tactically target posts, eliminate terror cells, and deter the enemy.
But more time is needed.
On Monday, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant noted that Israel concluded the intensive phase of its offensive in northern Gaza and that the concentrated fighting in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis will also end soon. In the 'third phase' of the war, expected to take up to six months, specialized units will carry out tactical operations. This third phase will consist of slow but steady progress as forces advance house by house, street by street, and tunnel shaft by tunnel shaft, gradually eliminating Hamas.
As Israeli troops continue fighting close-range battles across the Strip in urban areas - in buildings, schools, and hospitals, which house Hamas' underground terror tunnel network, with tunnel shafts serving as the entry points into the subterranean city of terror - tunnels provide Hamas operatives protection, enabling them to move quickly and safely underground and surprise Israeli forces. The tunnels serve as the home of Hamas' command-and-control centers weapon depots and production facilities.
The New York Times reported this week that the tunnels, which were estimated to have been 250 miles in total, are now believed to be between 350 and 450 miles, while the Gaza Strip itself is only 25 miles at its longest point. The report also claims that officials estimate there are approximately 5,700 tunnel shafts hidden across Gaza. Some are wide enough to drive cars inside them, and a seven-story deep tunnel was uncovered by the IDF, showcasing the scope and the complexity of the tunnel system. The IDF destroyed hundreds of tunnels and entry shafts using classified military technology developed over the years and since the start of the war.
Throughout the operation, troops confiscated Hamas intelligence including computers, hard drives, maps, and communication devices, amounting to over 70,000 million files, the IDF has said. In addition, many Hamas terrorists have surrendered and have also provided critical information in interrogations.
In recent days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi have all reaffirmed to the Israeli public, and the world, that the war will take time, with many months of fighting ahead.
The successes of the IDF to date enabled the army to withdraw large numbers of reserve forces. Their return, many of whom work in hi-tech, will help the Israeli economy recover somewhat from the costs of the war, estimated at $220 million per day. And, if the North deteriorates, these reservists can quickly be deployed.
The psychological warfare that Hamas has been conducting against the Israeli public, releasing videos of hostages in body bags and announcements of the deaths of captives, has taken its toll. Hamas is trying to deliver a clear message through these videos - if Israel continues fighting, more captives will die, pressuring the government to agree to a ceasefire deal for their return.
This week, a rift appears to have developed in the war cabinet about the military's conduct in Gaza, dividing the war cabinet members into two camps - Benny Gantz, head of the National Unity party, together with fellow MK Gadi Eisenkot, both of whom formerly served as IDF Chief of Staff - against Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi.
On Sunday, during a war cabinet meeting, Eisenkot reportedly said ""We need to stop lying to ourselves. We need to show courage and lead a major agreement that will bring the captives home. There is no need to continue to march blindly while they are there. This is a critical time to make brave decisions. Otherwise, we have nothing to look for here.""
From the reports, it appears that Gantz and Eisenkot are pushing for a policy that would end fighting in return for the release of hostages, which they believe is the only effective way to get them out. In Eisenkot's view, the IDF is strong enough to take a break from the fighting now to ensure the return of the captives and will be able to confront Hamas again in the future, effectively ending the current war.
On the opposing side, Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi are backing the position that the continuation of the military operation, putting further pressure on Hamas, is the only way to ensure the release of the captives. A lengthy ceasefire, in their opinion, will weaken Israel strategically. In a war of terror, they believe, taking a 'shortcut' - giving in to the demands of terrorists - will lead to future hostage-taking and another massacre of Israelis.
From their vantage point, only the continued application of military pressure will lead to the freeing of captives. This is what led to the hostage release deals thus far, they claim.
Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi believe that while sanctifying and preserving life is an essential part of the Israeli DNA, pausing or ending the war in exchange for the return of the hostages would be a major mistake. There are several goals to the war, and they do not always converge. One aim is bringing back the hostages, but another is dismantling the military capabilities of Hamas to ensure that they cannot pose a threat to Israel. If Hamas is allowed to retain its military capabilities- rearm and restructure during a ceasefire- residents of the Gaza Envelope communities will never be able to return to their towns and kibbutzim.
Moreover, Iran and its proxies - Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, ISIS, and terror cells in Iraq and Syria - are waiting to see how Israel reacts. According to this point of view, if Israel were to pause or end the fighting to free hostages while leaving Hamas' weaponry and leadership intact, Israel's enemies would take notice. They will see that Israel is vulnerable to hostage-taking and it will only be a matter of time before the next Iran-sponsored attack or kidnapping occurs.
Continuing the fighting enables Israel to retain its power of deterrence. After the events of October 7, Israel must have zero tolerance for terror.
Bringing back the hostages is closely tied to continuing the fight against Hamas. Only this will deter our enemies and will provide a clear message to Iran and its proxies that Israel will not give in to terror. It will force Yahya Sinwar to abandon his dream that, somehow, the IDF will give up on Gaza, enabling Hamas to retain its power for him and his successors. According to this school of thought, military pressure is the most effective way to ensure the release of Israeli captives and deter Israel's enemies from pursuing further attacks.
Israel's leaders are not indifferent or insensitive to the hostages and their families. They have spent countless hours strategizing ways to get them out of Gaza, both in internal discussions and in international negotiations. Unfortunately, this war has tested Israeli leadership, presenting them with tough and critical decisions that impact the lives and survival of the captives, soldiers evacuated Israeli civilians, and the Israeli society as a whole. Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, is being tested as a whole- its leadership, army, and civilians. Each decision is due to change the future of the Jewish State, and the stakes are high. Let us hope that the third stage of the war will lead to stability in Israel, Gaza, and the entire region.

Is a deal for a long-term pause a Hamas victory?

Reports that a new deal may be in the works with Hamas to pause fighting in Gaza and enable hostages to be released raise concerns about Hamas demands.
The first deal was brokered in mid-November and saw fighting end for a week in late November. Hamas has suffered more losses since then, including the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis where the IDF has been operating since early December. Yet, an ostensibly weakened Hamas, appears to be requesting even more from a new deal than it got from the first one.
Let's start with the reports. The deal is reported to include a several-months pause in fighting in return for the release of most remaining hostages.
However, we've been misled in the past. For instance, the first deal was supposed to include elderly hostages, women and children. Only later it revealed that ""women"" meant older women and mothers and that it was always understood that younger women would be left in the hands of Hamas. This tragic mistake followed increasing evidence of sexual abuse. Yet, no priority was placed on their release.
Also, Hamas lied about releasing the Bibas family, claiming they were being held by other groups or by private Gazan civilians. These claims are always floated when hostage talks begin, so that Hamas can drag out the talks and pretend it doesn't know where the hostages are.
This creates a contradiction. Why are the talks taking place with Qatar, which hosts Hamas, if Hamas doesn't even hold all the hostages? If some of the hostages are held by Gazan civilians, then what's the point of talking to Hamas via a country that hosts Hamas?
The Israeli public is nevertheless presented with this scenario: Hamas will do a deal, but Hamas doesn't hold all the hostages, but Hamas will find them, but if Hamas doesn't find them, that's ok because then it will still get a pause in fighting to look for them or pretend to look for them, and then when it violates the deal that's ok too because it was known all along Hamas couldn't find them or Hamas was lying.
Hamas misled Israel the first time, followed by two more months of fighting, from December 1 to January 28 and now Hamas is once again in the driver's seat trying to secure even more than it did back in November for fewer hostages.
If you realize something doesn't make sense, you're right. It doesn't make sense that Hamas, weaker today than it was on November 24, is seeking to win a much longer respite to release fewer hostages.
THE ISRAELI PUBLIC deserves to know why young women have often been at the back of the line. The story is that Hamas claims the women are all soldiers and therefore deserves a ""high price"" for them. Once again, this shows Hamas is the one driving these demands, even though it continues to lose territory and terrorists.
According to the IDF Hamas has lost 9,000 members of its terrorist army, roughly a third, and it has also lost thousands injured. The Jerusalem Post reported last week that up to 60% of Hamas terrorists are out of action.
On the other hand reports also say that up to 80% of Hamas tunnels have not been destroyed. Many of those tunnels are in areas over which the IDF has tacit control, so finding them is only a matter of time.
But the point is that Hamas continues to have some command and control. It controls Rafah on the border and through that control it controls humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Hamas may also be trying to infiltrate the 250,000 estimated Gazans who remain in the north. The Hamas tentacles are waiting to grow back. If Hamas gets a months-long ceasefire, it can restore its tentacles, go back to the tunnels, recruit more terrorists from people in the humanitarian zone, and exploit the aid coming into Gaza to grow wealthy and powerful again.
These should be top concerns. Israel has been told that when the war is over Hamas won't be in Gaza. That claim has been downgraded to: there won't be a Hamas threat from Gaza.
With the first pause in November, reports said that military pressure had led to the successful release of hostages. Now, two months later, with additional military pressure, it appears that Hamas it trying to stack the deal to avoid releasing many hostages up front.
Considering that Hamas began this war with a genocidal attack on Israel, and considering its known crimes, and considering that it violated the first deal, and has continued to influence Israel psychologically with hostage videos, granting Hamas a months-long ceasefire where it doesn't have to fulfill its obligations immediately, is problematic.
Was this the Hamas plan all along? To attack on October 7, commit mass murder, rape and destruction; then to run back to Gaza with hostages, to hide in tunnels and wait out the war, which it expected would last maybe two months.
It did this in 2009 and 2014. Then it expected the international community to pressure Israel for a ceasefire, leaving its leadership intact and channels of funding from abroad open to rebuild its arsenal.
At the same time it wanted to use the war to win concessions from Israel and broaden support for Hamas in the West Bank.
So far the Hamas leadership is mostly intact and its terror infrastructure too, even if damaged. Hamas expects money and humanitarian aid to flow in so that it can continue to control over Gaza's civilians, whom it uses as human shields. It thinks time is on its side. Its push for a long ceasefire is evidence of this. It may have lost 15,000 terrorists, killed and wounded, but it can replace them slowly. Therein lies the danger of a long ceasefire. Time is not on Israel's side.

Post-war international peace conference

As of January 2024, the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is evolving into its third stage - from aerial bombardment followed by a massive ground operation into low-intensity warfare and the planned establishment of buffer zones, with or without a limited Israeli military presence in the enclave.
The manner of the war's conduct will determine the range of political options in its aftermath. Significant political-diplomatic discussions regarding the ""day after"" are essential, despite the Israeli government's sweeping refusal to engage in these.
Given the political unwillingness and/or inability of the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships to advance peace, along with the dire circumstances in the Gaza Strip, and the international and domestic repercussions for several key actors (including the United States, Egypt, and Jordan), the potential benefits of an international peace conference immediately following the war should be explored.
Such a conference could grant domestic and international legitimacy to drawing up a coherent road map for the de-escalation, stabilization, demilitarization, reconstruction, and governance of the Gaza Strip in the immediate term.
Moreover, an international peace conference should also address the ultimate diplomatic resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on UNGA Resolution 181 (the 1947 Partition Resolution) and the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank on the basis of UNSC Resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1515 (2003), and 2334 (2016).
International peace conferences usually take place in the aftermath of wars, though sometimes they are convened as a deliberated diplomatic effort to end wars in long and protracted conflicts. They serve as useful diplomatic tools for peacemaking in the form of conflict prevention, management, and resolution. Moreover, they can serve as instruments of peace-building regarding issues such as reconstruction, governance, and transitional post-war security and civilian regimes. They also enable focused attention on the issues at hand, bringing together all relevant actors in a multilateral diplomatic setting sponsored by trusted conveners in order to foster diplomatic momentum, formally end wars and establish peace treaties; set road maps and timetables and even firm deadlines for their implementation; and formulate an agenda to kickstart substantial and sustainable peace processes.
Various international peace conferences have been held in the aftermath of crises and wars in order to seek an end to the state of permanent conflict involving Israel, the Palestinians, and neighboring Arab States, with mixed results.
These include the Lausanne Conference, 1949; the Geneva Conference, 1973; the Madrid Conference, 1991; the Annapolis Conference, 2007; and the Paris Conference, 2017. Such peace conferences have, in the past, neither been resounding successes nor complete failures.
The Lausanne Conference (1949) was a multilateral forum of negotiations that failed to transcend the limits of the Rhodes Armistices and reach a permanent peace between Israel and its neighbors.
Similarly, the Geneva Conference of December 1973 did not result in any breakthrough after the Yom Kippur War (Syria did not even participate).
The Paris Conference (2017) failed mainly due to the absence of both Israel and the Palestinians.
In a more positive vein, Madrid (1991) and Annapolis (2007) established useful diplomatic frameworks for multilateral and bilateral negotiations rather than constituting negotiating fora in themselves. The logic of an international peace conference is to produce a formal road map and agenda seems to be even more relevant these days, given the urgency of planning the ""day after"" even before the formal end of the Gaza war. The Madrid Conference kickstarted negotiating processes that matured into an Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement and established a peace process with the Palestinians. Based on this relevant and successful precedent, an international peace conference following the Israel-Hamas War is a necessary, even if not sufficient, political-diplomatic component of a road map for Gaza's rehabilitation and negotiations on a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The immediate concerns regarding the reconstruction, governance, security, and demilitarization of the Gaza Strip are intrinsically linked to the eventual resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution, since the political vision (and future reality) is a precondition for mobilizing international actors in the immediate term for the reconstruction and governance of the Gaza Strip.
LOOKING AHEAD, Gaza's political future must be organically linked to that of the West Bank. A peace conference could constitute a ""threshold event"" setting a diplomatic clock for transition from the immediate to the medium term to be completed within three to five years of a ceasefire - ending the Israel-Hamas war - until the signing of peace agreements between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine.
Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) must participate in the peace conference in the immediate aftermath of the war, ruling out the option of elections as a precondition for the event. Despite the need for new leadership, the required domestic political changes for democratic elections in both Israel and the PA might take months, if not years.
The peace conference will be mostly a ceremonial and symbolic event (without substantive negotiations during its four-to-five-day duration), attended by relevant members of the international community led by the US and the other permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Its agenda should include the following elements.
· Conditional international recognition of the State of Palestine, demilitarized, and with borders to be agreed upon in subsequent peace negotiations.
· The establishment of a transitional authority in Gaza led by the United Nations - or any other international framework - for two to three years. This authority, including multinational peacekeeping forces with a clear security and governance mandate, should gradually replace the IDF presence in the Gaza Strip, in full coordination with Israel and the existing PA.
· Inaugurating a Middle East ""Marshall Plan"" for the two components of the PA - Gaza and the West Bank. Such a plan should also help to enhance the governance, capabilities, and infrastructure of the PA, leading the way to the building of the Palestinian State in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under a new legitimate, democratically elected Palestinian leadership.
· A resumption of peace negotiations with increased involvement and investment by the international community, leading to a two-state solution and the conclusion of peace treaties between Israel and all member-states of the Arab League, according to the principles of the Arab Peace Initiative (2002).
· As was the case in Madrid (1991), the peace conference will formally launch bilateral and multilateral negotiating channels in which Israel and the Palestinians (in the bilateral track) will take part under the supervision of Quartet members (the US, the UN, the European Union, and Russia) in addition to China and the countries of the Regional Quartet (Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia). At the same time, multilateral negotiating channels will be devoted to discussing pressing issues of Gaza's reconstruction and, in the longer term, cooperation on regional issues such as economic development, the environment, and arms control.
Absent a political horizon based on a peace conference producing immediate change, Israel may find itself, against its will, mired for years in the Gaza quagmire.
The peace conference proposed here is an integrated (hybrid) model. Its agenda should include related issues of immediate humanitarian and logistical assistance to the Gaza Strip; the establishment and empowerment of a temporary international authority for the administration of the enclave during a transitional period of several years; and the empowerment and strengthening of the PA.
The agenda should also include substantive negotiations ultimately leading to the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state alongside the State of Israel, as well as additional peace agreements between Israel and the Arab states, first and foremost Saudi Arabia.

Deadly rocket fire targeting northern Israel on February 14 illustrates that Hezbollah is not deterred and is escalating attacks on Israel, seeking to target communities deeper inside the country. Israel evacuated 80,000 people from northern communities in early October because of Hezbollah attacks.
Hezbollah believes it has impunity to attack Israel and has launched more than 2,000 rockets at the Jewish state. Rockets fired by the Iranian-backed terrorist group wounded a woman and her son on February 13. So far, there has been no attempt to massively deter and prevent Hezbollah's attacks. Instead, Israel prefers precision and proportional response.
Hezbollah gambled in early October that it could attack Israel with impunity and that Israel, focused on the war against Hamas, would not be willing to start a two-front war. Indeed, this is not the Israel of 1967 or 1973, when it successfully defeated multiple conventional armies on multiple fronts in a week or two of fighting, despite many obstacles. Today Israel is focused on Gaza and the slow, grinding conflict there.
It is a conflict in which there has been no decisive victory so far. However, the IDF has said it believes the campaign in Gaza is successful, given the complexity of the fight in urban terrain with tunnels underground, and has exceeded expectations.
Hezbollah has been watching Israel's responses closely. It knows that Israeli leaders have vowed to alter the situation in the north. What this means is that Israel has vowed to return residents to their homes and end the rocket fire that Hezbollah carries out daily. However, Hezbollah has not been deterred so far.
It has lost around 200 of its members to Israel's retaliatory fire. But 200 members is apparently a number Hezbollah is willing to sacrifice. In addition, Hezbollah knows that proposals have been delivered to Beirut begging Hezbollah to remove a few hundred fighters from the border and make a tacit symbolic withdrawal, so as to quiet the tensions in the north.
Hezbollah, like Hamas, has closely followed how to embed itself in the civilian population and tunnel under villages in southern Lebanon. Like Hamas, it uses civilians as human shields and has created an empire of terrorist infrastructure in southern Lebanon.
As with Gaza, the international community enabled this. A UN resolution that helped end the 2006 war was supposed to prevent Hezbollah from saturating the border with rockets and bunkers. Instead, Hezbollah has been put on steroids since 2006, and has exponentially expanded its arsenal. In Lebanon, Hezbollah has also expanded its political role and has come close to controlling the state itself.
As such, Hezbollah is now a very large organization with a lot on its plate. It was goaded into attacks on Israel after October 7. It has generally targeted areas close to the border. This has led to a kind of concept. So long as Hezbollah only rains down missiles within a few kilometers of the border, then Israel will respond with precision strikes by artillery and warplanes. It's a kind of gentleman's agreement of how to wage this new normal war. As long as casualties are relatively low, apparently this is fine.
Hezbollah has been slowly escalating, to test the redlines. In January, it targeted Safed and Meron and it didn't feel a major increased response. Now, it has targeted Safed again, a day after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah had rejected a French proposal to reduce tensions. Nasrallah claimed that ""hundreds of thousands"" of ""settlers"" would not return to the north unless the Gaza war ends.
Hezbollah calls Jews in Israel ""settlers,"" the same language Hamas uses and the same language that led Hamas to October 7. Northern Israel is now clouded with the same concept that Gaza was clouded with on October 6, a concept that portrays Hezbollah as manageable and one where Hezbollah gets to decide where to attack and when to attack and place the lives of civilians in the North at risk.

'I stand with Israel!"" These words have been said by people all around the world since the beginning of the conflict in Israel. The question is, how does one practically stand upon the words ""I stand with Israel?""
Are they just words, or do they mean something more? In 2015, the European Union published new rules regarding products originating in the biblical heartland of Israel, Judea, and Samaria (the West Bank). Their guidelines voiced the outrageous belief that the biblical heartland is not part of Israel and that goods produced there could not be labeled as ""Made in Israel.""
For some, the actions of the European Union in 2015 were just words; rhetoric being rehashed from the pages of the history books. For a few, however, these words were a call to counter-action.
Steve Wearp, a successful engineer from Texas, heard the EU ruling and decided that this was his fight. He knew well the history of the Holocaust, and decided that the boycotts, sanctions, and relabeling of Jewish goods made by Jews in Judea were the first steps toward a horrific repeat of the antisemitism and anti-Zionism of 1930s Europe. He left his job in 2016 and traveled to Israel to find ways to practically stand with Israel.
Wearp and his oldest son met with small family business owners and artists from all across Judea and Samaria to discuss ways to bring their products into the international market outside of Israel. That was eight years ago. Today, their company, Blessed Buy Israel, has grown into an exporter of Israeli goods and goodness to the entire world.
Wearp and his family have stood by Israel's side through thick and thin over the past eight years, but since the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, they have been inviting many more people to join them in ""BUYcotting"" Israel. Wearp has always encouraged his customers to ""buy what they believe.""
NOW IS an opportunity for people around the world to join with the Wearp family in supporting the small family-owned businesses of Judea and Samaria because a strong biblical heartland means a strong Israel.
As the war continues in Gaza, the Wearp family has been throughout Israel volunteering and supporting the farmers and small businesses who are suffering the most from the economic and workforce downturn.
It is one thing to wave a flag or pray for the State of Israel; it is a whole different level to buy Israeli products and then share about it with your family and friends. The products people buy from Blessed Buy Israel put money directly back into the businesses and families of Israel. The idea behind Blessed Buy Israel wasn't just for people to connect to the products of Israel, but also to the stories and lives of the pioneers behind these amazing products.
For example: Baruch and Batya came from America to raise their children, plant fruit trees, and make ceramics inspired by the Land of Israel. Baruch has planted hundreds of trees on their land in the community of Itamar, and Batya runs the ceramics studio. They've created a beautiful paradise around their home.
Another family, Baruch and Shimrit Feuchtwanger, have been in the honey business for generations. Throughout the ups and downs of the challenges that come with beekeeping, they have persevered and brought forth delicious honey in the Land of Milk and Honey.
There's Erez and Vered, who took the money from their wedding and put it all toward planting vines and olive trees in the biblical heartland of Israel. They put in some of the first vineyards in Judea and Samaria in centuries, and now their olive oil and wines are winning awards around the world.
Blessed Buy Israel is calling on all supporters of Israel to join their Heartland Challenge. The idea is to commit to buying only certain Israeli products. Do you drink tea? Commit to only drinking Israeli tea. Do you use olive oil? Commit to using only Israeli olive oil. Do you like to eat locusts and honey? Commit to only buying Israeli honey and eating Israeli locusts! This will connect you to the products and people of Israel and will allow you to share why you only purchase those products from Israel.
Make your words ""I stand with Israel"" become more than simply words. Show your friends these amazing products. Tell your neighbors about how you practically support Israel. Share with your local businesses the idea of promoting and selling products from the Holy Land! Commit to the Heartland Challenge today and post about your commitment on social media with the hashtags #Heartland Challenge! Show the world that ""I Stand With Israel!""
Don't just buy Israel... buy Blessed Buy Israel and make a true difference in the lives of small business owners across the beautiful land of Israel today.

Hamas stronghold in Rafah is key to its survival

Hamas has been defeated in many parts of the Gaza strip. This is particularly true in terms of Hamas battalions, the organizational tactical level unit that it has used to control areas in Gaza. Of 24 Hamas battalions, it is believed more than 18 have been defeated or destroyed. However, Hamas continues to rule in Rafah, a key area on the Egyptian border where it controls humanitarian aid that enters Gaza.
For Hamas the control of Rafah is of the utmost importance. It wants to have a stranglehold on aid and also control other types of items, such as smuggled goods or arms stockpiles, which Egypt sought to stop. The region is now awaiting the likelihood of a struggle for Rafah. Al-Ain media in the UAE reported on February 7 that Israel has made preparations for operations in Rafah, and asks ""has the countdown begun?""
The report said ""fears have been increasing for several days about an Israeli attack."" Al Jazeera in Qatar, where key Hamas leaders live, also reported that the UN has said ""everything possible"" must be done to avoid an Israeli attack on Rafah. The New Arab, an online media outlet, said that Egypt has warned that Israeli moves there could jeopardize the peace treaty.
For some commentators the humanitarian issue of overcrowding in the city by Gazans who fled fighting elsewhere is very important. However, it's not clear why so many people fled to Rafah when they could also go to the humanitarian zone in Gaza near the coast, called Al-Mawasi. Hamas benefits from having a large number of internally displaced people in Rafah that it can use as human shields.
Hamas wants to survive, having lost control of other areas in Gaza. It has tried to infiltrate gunmen into northern Gaza and has also sought to maintain civil control in the north. However, when it comes to its actual terrorist units, it has suffered many losses.
Even as it loses ground, its demands for a hostage deal have grown. It wants an extended ceasefire and a three-phase release of hostages in return for prisoners in Israel, followed by an end to the war. It has demanded an end to Israeli surveillance, more aid and more support for reconstruction.
This has been the Hamas plan all along. It wanted to hide for a few months and watch as international pressure built up on Israel, and then re-emerge as it has done after previous wars in 2009, 2012, 2014, and 2021.
For Hamas, holding on to Rafah is key. It needs to control humanitarian aid because this is how it controls the people of Gaza. It has worked over the years to create a symbiotic partnership with international organizations, so that it is able to build tunnels and store weapons throughout Gaza and it outsources much of the aid work aboveground to internationals. In this way Hamas benefits and the international organizations also benefit because they get to claim they are responsible for helping people.
A TELLING GUARDIAN article on January 30, reveals the role of Hamas in relation to international organizations. It notes that ""a senior UN official described Rafah, the southernmost town in Gaza, as 'the last remaining place with any real civil order' due to the presence of local Hamas police."" Notice how Hamas, which committed a genocidal attack on Israel, massacring civilians and dragging hostages back to Gaza, is presented as ""civil order."" The terrorist group that stores rockets and weapons in schools and homes, is ""civil order.""
The article reveals more of this trend of Hamas being portrayed in a positive light by international organizations that work with and rely on it. ""Hamas administrators and police maintain firm control of the south, where much of the population is concentrated, though civil order is breaking down in central regions,"" the article notes. A ""senior humanitarian official"" told The Guardian that ""You still see Hamas police in different areas who have a grip to some extent on law and order in some places, including in the north."" Hamas, which launched a war on Israel and has brought destruction on Gaza and runs it as an authoritarian state is portrayed as ""law and order."" It's clear the international organizations have a preference for Hamas rule.
The article goes on to note that ""aid agencies trying to distribute food, fuel and other essentials to the displaced in southern Gaza continue to deal with Hamas-appointed officials. Hamas still provides police escorts for convoys."" Another international organization member of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza is quoted as saying ""there is a generalized breakdown of law and order. Criminality overall is increasing."" Note here, that Hamas which holds hostages in tunnels underground is not described as ""criminality,"" rather it is other Gazans.
Hamas is often praised in these Guardian accounts for providing ""aid convoys"" with ""armed escorts."" One quote notes ""aid convoys are receiving armed escorts. It is unclear if these are Hamas police, who are still present and visible, or private security companies. There is a fine line between where one starts and the other stops.""
The portrayal here of Hamas as the ""law and order"" in Gaza and the positive spin it receives for putting armed men in charge of humanitarian aid is key to understanding how the Hamas stranglehold on Rafah keeps it in power. Hamas must control the spigot to continue working with various international organizations. Hamas and these organizations have become mutually dependent. The Hamas one-party terror state lets the agencies operate and in return, like a mafia selling protection, they put armed men around humanitarian aid convoys.

US Jewry understands immense risks, challenges of two states. MK Ohad Tal: Palestinian statehood post-war would reward terrorism

Major Jewish organizations in the US, including liberal and democratic-leaning ones, are receptive to the claim that the outcome of the current war between Israel and Hamas should not be a two-state solution, Religious Zionist Party MK and member of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee (FADC) Ohad Tal said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.
Tal spoke to the Post from the US, where he has spent over a week meeting with US officials, including National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications Adm. John Kirby, Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson, leaders of Jewish and Christian organizations, and others.
Tal said that his core message in all of his meetings was that awarding the Palestinians a state as a result of the monstrous Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 indicates that terrorism pays off - and the entire world, not just Israel, will pay a heavy price and suffer a rise in global terrorism as a result.
This message is opposed to the US administration's policy to end the war by creating a regional agreement that will include normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and the taking of concrete steps towards the formation of a Palestinian state.
But Tal is adamant that Palestinian statehood at this time would have disastrous consequences.
""After October 7, even talking about a Palestinian state sends a very strong message in the Middle East that terror is the way to go... and tells radical Islam all over the world that if you want something, get it by terror,"" Tal stressed.
He also said that he was surprised by the receptiveness of his messages from members of the House on both sides of the aisle, as well as by Jewish organizations, some of which are outspokenly liberal and democratic-leaning.
""Many people in America [have been in] shock since October 7, and don't know what to do and how to translate their experience to a change of policy - but they do understand that something needs to change.""
The fact that they were willing to hear Tal, whose party is considered far-right, and even admit that his claim made sense, was significant. But policy won't change in one day, Tal warned.
""I think we need to keep conveying these messages in America both within the Jewish community and in the political [arena], and I hope that the result will be a policy change,"" he said.
Tal believes that rather than end the war with a diplomatic agreement, Israel must defeat Hamas decisively; to win the war not in Western terms, but in ""Middle Eastern terms.""
""We have to think the way Hamas thinks, the way [Hamas leader Yahya] Sinwar thinks,"" he said.
This means that Israel must not agree to a hostage deal that would include a lengthy ceasefire and the release of a large number of Palestinian terrorists from Israeli jails, unless the agreement included all of the 136 hostages. Otherwise, Sinwar would simply demand even more for another deal later on. Only a return of all the hostages could be considered an achievement, and this will only happen if Sinwar feels threatened, he argued.
""The goal is to always pressure Hamas (militarily). That is the only language they understand,"" Tal asserted.
Tal argued that in addition to pressuring Sinwar, Israel must not allow Hamas to return to positions of civil administration, and Israel should not allow the Palestinian Authority to receive such positions either - Tal repeats a claim made by many on Israel's right, and even its center, that the Palestinian Authority was corrupt and de-facto supported terror, and therefore was not a partner for peace.
If necessary, the IDF must run civilian life in Gaza until a moderate Gazan force comes forward, Tal explained. Such moderate forces exist, he argued, but they are not coming forward out of fear of Hamas and of ""mixed messages"" originating from Israel.
Some Hamas civilian officials have already begun to appear in northern Gaza, and Israel must make it clear that Hamas will no longer hold any administrative positions. If this requires that the IDF take over the distribution of humanitarian aid and run civil matters in the Strip, so be it, Tal argued.
Furthermore, Tal presented a security-based argument in favor of Israel's retaining control over at least parts of the Gaza Strip.
""Israel is facing for the first time in 75 years a real existential threat, because Sinwar succeeded in showing everyone in the Middle East that it is possible to [bypass] Israeli intelligence... [demonstrating] that Israel is vulnerable. This, in the Middle East, is extremely dangerous,"" Tal said.
Israel's enemies in the Middle East are sitting on the fences watching, and killing thousands of Hamas terrorists or even killing Sinwar himself is not enough, ""because Hamas will rebuild and everything will go back to being the same,"" he added.
The only real deterrence of Palestinian terror is therefore loss of land, Tal claimed, and only by taking over parts of the Strip will Israel's enemies understand the price of attacking Israel. Tal even provided an estimate of the portion of Gaza that Israel should take over and demilitarize - 45%, which is approximately the entire Strip's northern area. Debate over the issue of building Jewish settlements in Gaza can come later, Tal concluded.

Whoever is at a loss about what the future holds for the Israel-Hezbollah conflict should not feel bad. The constant threats, varying verbiage, and increasing number of attacks back and forth are extremely difficult to cut through and understand.
However, after multiple recent visits to the North that included briefings with top officials, discussions with rank-and-file soldiers, and checking in with other key sources, The Jerusalem Post can ""translate"" and separate the important developments from the less crucial ones.
First of all, despite a rise in threats from both the Israeli and the Hezbollah sides, neither is actually angling to open up a much larger general war anytime soon.
This sounds counterintuitive after days in which multiple top Israeli officials said that Israel and Hezbollah are closer to conflict than ever and Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah has himself rattled his saber more loudly in each speech.
But if you compare Israeli and Hezbollah statements from several weeks ago, they were not that different.
Most of it is a smokescreen for each side to try to gain the upper hand in the competition for who is perceived as winning so far and who will be able to declare victory whenever the conflict ends.
However, there are some actions and facts that matter far more than words.
In recent weeks, the IDF has attacked close to 15 villages that Hezbollah was using for cover to fire on Israel's North.
During the middle of last week, the IDF significantly upped its level of attack when it fired on Hezbollah fighters and positions at the Wadi Saluki Village dozens of times in a matter of hours.
Until then, the IDF had mostly done much smaller-scale attacks on the villages. This was after months during which the IDF did not strike the villages at all and had been willing only to attack Hezbollah rocket crews in open areas.
This shift has hurt Hezbollah and forced it to recalibrate its calculations regarding how to continue firing on Israel; it was much more important than any verbiage.
The result was that the IDF, as of around a month ago, had pushed about 50% of Hezbollah's 6,000 Radwan forces back from the border with Israel, and that percentage is now closer to 75%, The Post has learned.
The Post also understands that the IDF has been even more successful in destroying Hezbollah's watchtowers on the border - destroying or damaging between 80 and 95% of them, depending on what one considers damaged versus destroyed.
Besides carrying out that grand scale of military actions that changes the playing field, the IDF admitted to assassinating Hezbollah drone chief Ali Hussein Bergi, and the terrorist group has accused Jerusalem of killing Hezbollah's Radwan chief, Wissam al-Tawil. These killings did not change the situation on the ground as much as the military actions did, but they were a direct hit on Nasrallah's confidence, making it clearer than any verbiage that the IDF is willing to take off the gloves - even against top Hezbollah officials - if the terrorist group crosses certain redlines.
WHY, THEN, is a general war unlikely in the near future?
From Nasrallah's perspective, he does not need a bigger war to claim victory. He succeeded in forcing some 80,000 Israelis to evacuate the North and has shown that he can maintain fire on Israel for more than 100 days without making a dent in his arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and mortars.
All he needs to do is try not to lose face or give up too much before a new ceasefire kicks into place.
And while he views the world differently than Westerners, he certainly prefers not to have Beirut and Lebanon look like the significantly destroyed Gaza Strip.
Israel and the IDF leadership, for their part, are highly split on what to do with Hezbollah.
All of the key political and defense officials are in favor of trying to negotiate a diplomatic deal, according to which Hezbollah would withdraw 100% of its Radwan forces from the border with Israel, with war only as a second choice.
However, some in the IDF think that a firm ultimatum and deadline should be given to Hezbollah sooner rather than later.
Some top IDF officials who, before the war, might have been leaning more aggressively toward attacking Hezbollah very soon - with a preemptive strike to start what they viewed as an inevitable conflict on Israeli terms - now, counter-intuitively, may be willing to wait for a later date.
While some IDF officials view Hezbollah's actions - injecting itself into the war between Israel and Hamas and forcing the evacuation of Israel's northern residents for over 100 days - as an effrontery that must be corrected immediately, others believe that Israel's actions in the last month or so have altered the picture.
Having pushed back such a substantial amount of Hezbollah's forces, they feel the chance of the terrorist group mounting an attack is the lowest it has been in years and that it buys more time for the IDF to delay a preemptive strike to some more opportune moment in the distant future.
Still, others are terrified of what Hezbollah can do to Israel's home front if it releases its full arsenal, even though Israel would doubtlessly ""win"" such a conflict in terms of killing and destroying more Hezbollah forces and infrastructure in absolute terms. Put simply, they view Israel as less able than the Lebanese terrorist group to tolerate losses to the home front.
Weather also matters, and fighting a big war mid-winter could hurt Israel's ability to exploit its higher-quality military capabilities.
Finally, some do not want to start a major fight with Hezbollah until either Khan Yunis is subdued, still months away, or at an even later date when Gaza is stabilized and beyond an immediate risk of Hamas returning to take over.
Israeli actions have set Hezbollah back significantly, but have also been tailored to be clearly limited from upsetting Hezbollah beyond a certain point.
A general war could still break out tomorrow if one side or another miscalculates and pushes the other too far. But in the meantime, readers will get a more accurate picture by watching the actions of both sides, both what they do and what they do not do, than by the bellicose speeches that continue to repeat themselves.

The world's most influential medical journals have shown an anti-Israel bias when reporting about the murderous incursion of thousands of Hamas terrorists into Israel on October 7 and the war it sparked against Hamas in Gaza, according to an analysis in the latest issue of The Israel Medical Association Journal (IMAJ).
The analysis was carried out abroad by Dr. Gabriel Levine of the Jewish General Hospital of McGill University in Montreal; Dr. Raanan Meyer of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles; and Dr. Yoav Brezinov of the Lady Davis Institute at McGill.
They reviewed 1,628 English-language scientific publications using keywords related to Gaza, Hamas, violence, humans, and Israel. In 37 of them, the most prominent were The Lancet, the BMJ, and Nature. The articles were written by authors from 12 countries around the world (46% were ""correspondence (letters to the editor)"" and 32% under in the ""news"" category.
Eighteen of the 37 articles were published in The Lancet (in the UK); nine in the BMJ (also UK); five in Nature, and five in other medical journals.
A total of 43% of the articles were in favor of Hamas and Gaza, 21.6% wrote positive things about Israel and the IDF; and 35.1% were neutral.
Most of the pro-Israel correspondences were written by Israelis. Pro-Palestinian articles had a higher Altmetric score (an early indicator of an article's potential impact that is calculated quickly after publication) so their impact in the social media was much stronger than those that were pro-Israel.
Of the general medical news journals, none published a pro-Israel correspondence or news article, the North American physicians wrote. Of the 16 articles that were pro-Palestinian/Gaza, half were published in the UK, while others were sent from Gaza itself and from Jordan.
""The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a deeply contentious and emotionally charged issue. The media and academic journals covering this conflict often grapple with biases that stem from various sources. Academic journals may face challenges in maintaining complete impartiality, as researchers may bring their own biases into their work.
The challenge is to strive for balanced reporting and research that reflects the complexity of the conflict,"" they concluded.
""Addressing bias in both media and academic publications is essential for promoting objectivity and ensuring that a broader range of perspectives is considered in the ongoing conversation surrounding this protracted conflict.""

There are a number of reasons that US President Joe Biden is likely annoyed with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
For one, Netanyahu has distanced himself from Biden's ""day after"" Gaza plan of linking Israeli normalization with Saudi Arabia, with a strengthened Palestinian Authority-granted control of Gaza, all leading toward an eventual two-state scenario.
Netanyahu's insistence on keeping his far-Right partners Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich in the coalition must also rankle, as well as Biden's perception that the Israeli government is doing little or nothing to rein in settler extremists in the West Bank, as evidenced by the president's executive order last week against four settler offenders.
But above all, Netanyahu's steadfastness about continuing the Gaza war to its ultimate conclusion of invading Rafah and eliminating Hamas's remaining fighters and capabilities - without a clear-cut plan to provide safe passage for the more than a million Gazans who have converged on the beleaguered city during the war - is probably the latest issue that prompted Biden to reportedly talk about Netanyahu in meetings in, shall we say, undiplomatic terms.
To paraphrase an old joke: ""You can't call my prime minister an a-hole - only we can do that."" Surely, many people in Israel feel, like Biden reportedly does, that Netanyahu prefers to keep the war going for as long as possible, for his own political needs: keeping the coalition in place, and staving off the eventual state probe and the likely ruling for his dismissal.
And with every Gazan that is killed in the war, Biden is losing political support for his reelection campaign from the progressive side of his Democratic constituency.
While both men have their own motives for their actions, that shouldn't get in the way of some irrefutable facts.
Indeed, in its just and necessary war against Hamas, Israel has killed thousands of Palestinian residents of Gaza. It's also true that a sizeable number of the victims are Hamas terrorists, a tidbit that's never included when the ""Gaza Health Ministry"" - a transparent euphemism for Hamas - announces the number of those killed in Israeli attacks.
It's also true that a major military operation in Rafah will put many more Gaza civilians in danger of injury or death, even if a plan of safe passage is implemented.
On the other side of the truth coin is that Hamas has, until now, not offered a reasonable formula for a ceasefire that would bring hostages back and not entail a total Israel withdrawal from Gaza - which in essence would mean the end of the war with the terror group still in charge and not decimated.
The working policy among Israel's decision makers in government and the IDF is that only more military pressure on Hamas will force them to make concessions and agree to a deal that will free more hostages.
Biden may hold a grudge against Netanyahu, but the truth is that war cabinet Minister Benny Gantz - who some see as the great moderate alternative to Netanyahu - supports the broadening of fighting in southern Gaza and Rafah.
""There is no question about the need to act in any place in which there is terror. Broad action in Rafah, as we said in the past, is not in question,"" Gantz said, hours after the brilliant and daring IDF rescue operation of hostages Fernando Marman, 61, and Luis Har, 70, from Rafah.
That seems to be the consensus in Israel. We are now closing in on the last Hamas stronghold in Gaza, where its leadership and the remaining hostages are presumed to be.
Instead of putting the pressure on Israel to stop its campaign, the US and the rest of the world should be upping pressure on the genocidal terrorist group to release the hostages and surrender - and those countries so concerned with the civilians in Rafah should be working with Israel to provide safe passage and shelter for them so that the IDF can do its job.
If there is a valid proposal on the table, like the one reported on Tuesday by Biden of a six-week lull in fighting and a partial hostage release that would put off the Rafah campaign, then Israel must consider it.
But ultimately, only Jerusalem can decide what the best policy to pursue is - even if it means annoying its best friend in Washington.

Israel is facing isolation in the international arena. Across the board, in all disciplines and professions, from the hard sciences to the liberal arts to the business and hi-tech world and in medicine, the Jewish state has been turned into a pariah.
It began when Israel responded to the brutal Hamas massacre. Isolating Israel is not new, but of late, we are witness to a change in momentum.
From the signing of the first historic Abraham Accords in September 2020 until October 7, Israel was privy to a surge of diplomatic and business opportunities within the Arab world. Even a deal with Saudi Arabia was on the horizon.
And then, boom: October 7. On that day, things changed. Some actually suggest that one of the goals of the Hamas attack that day was specifically to torpedo a Saudi/Israeli deal.
Truth is, isolating Israel will hurt the world more than it will hurt Israel. The world is a better place because of Israel. Better because of its interaction with so many of the countries, places, institutions and companies around the world. Science, literature, dance, music, computers, medicine, technology - the list can go on and on - have benefited from Israel's innovations and inventions. From Israeli daring and Israeli drive; from Israel's fortitude and Israel's friendship.
On the most simplistic of levels, the world will suffer from the simple act of refusing to interact with individual Israelis. Israelis love to travel. Israelis love learning from and contributing to the cultures around them and around the world. And from their travels have come great bonds, continued friendships and fruitful collaborations.
And then came October 7. After Israel began to defend itself, many of these relationships began to fray and even disappear. For many, Israel as ""the victim"" was acceptable, but Israel as the defender, as the fighter, became a much more difficult image to accept.
IN JANUARY, a business intel company called Moring Consult published its results of a favorability study about Israel between September and December of 2023.
Not surprisingly, support for Israel has dropped significantly since the war against Hamas. Net favorability dropped globally by an average of 18.5 percentage points between September and December, decreasing in 42 out of the 43 countries polled. The only county where it did not drop was the United States.
Countries that occupy significant space on the world stage went from viewing Israel positively to having a negative view. China, South Africa and Brazil, as well as several Latin America countries to name a few.
Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom, countries already fostering a negative view of Israel, displayed significant declines. Net favorability in Japan, for instance, declined from -39.9% to -62.0%, in South Korea from -5.5% to -47.8%, and in the United Kingdom from -17.1% to -29.8%.
The long history of Israeli isolation in the international community has not hindered the amazing growth in the small Jewish state. And Israel should not make policy decisions based on how the world will interpret it or whether or not it will be perceived positively or negatively. Israel must make decisions based on its own best interests, especially when it comes to defense. National security, above all, must be based on the best interests of the country, not on those of personalities from within Israel or those weighing in from abroad.
Even after October 7, it is naivete to think that the world-at-large would adopt a more positive attitude toward Israel than toward Hamas. Look no further than that august international body known as the United Nations, the majority of whose members are not in agreement with either the United States or with Western world ideals. They cannot possibly, by extension, understand or sympathize with Israel.
IN THE 1960's, the G77 was created. Their common denominator was that each member country was either a former colony or a very poor developing country or both. Today they number 134 nations and are the largest block in the UN. They were the force behind UN resolution 3379 on November 10, 1975, proclaiming that Zionism is Racism.
The vote was 73 in favor, 35 against and 32 abstentions.
At the time, Daniel Patrick Moynihan was the US ambassador to the UN. He delivered a passionate speech in defense of Israel and democracy, a speech that then US secretary of state Henry Kissinger wanted him to mute and tone down. Kissinger thought the speech was too aggressive and would further alienate the United States, but Moynihan carried on as planned. In Moynihan's eyes, he was defending Israel and democracy.
Before the vote, the ambassador declared: ""The United Nations is about to make antisemitism international law."" In his speech against resolution 3379, Moynihan declared that the United States ""does not acknowledge, it will not abide by, it will never acquiesce in this infamous act... A great evil has been loosed upon the world.""
Israel will continue to fight. Israel will continue to be productive and creative, even if the international community shuts its doors and pulls in their welcome mats.
Israel is acting justly in its war against Hamas.
True friends will stand by Israel. Those who hate Jews and hate Israel are using this war against Hamas as an excuse to continue to hate Jews and hate Israel.
Israel may be isolated, but Israel will soldier on. It is the world that will suffer the greater loss - of that, I have no doubt.

Every Israeli soldier who falls in battle in the war against Hamas and Hezbollah is described as a hero. There is something heroic in an instantly positive response to a call to defend one's country and people.
But it is also important for every Israeli family that loses a loved one in battle to have that person publicly recognized as a hero to signify the importance of that individual in defending the security of the nation.
Some of the heroes of the War of Independence who are still living are saluting the heroes of today for their loyalty, courage, and determination. The heroes of yesteryear are saluting the generations of their children and grandchildren.
The idea for a public salute from the generation of independence came to Gil Samsonov, a partner in one of Israel's leading advertising agencies, when he overheard his 95-year-old father, who was a commander in the War of Independence, discussing military affairs with Samsonov's nephew.
Samsonov decided to look for other War of Independence veterans and to make a video, which he posted on YouTube to ensure that their heroism would be remembered.
* IT IS said that behind every great man is a great woman. But sometimes that's reversed, as in the case of workaholic social activist Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, whose husband, Adam, has supported her in her endeavors, and has taken care of the children and of their home, so that she can be free to serve the city and the state.
He was also singled out for praise at the formal appointment this week of Hassan-Nahoum as secretary-general of Kol Yisrael, a partner in the World Confederation of United Zionists. She succeeds Aaron Weil, and is the first woman to hold the position.
Kol Yisrael is apolitical in that it believes in diversity and wants to give a platform to a variety of Zionist-oriented ideas from Right, Left, and Center, with specific emphasis on points of agreement, but not to the exclusion of points of disagreement.
This was reflected in the large attendance at the appointment ceremony, of people with different Zionist affiliations all resting on the broad bed of Zionism as a common denominator.
The ceremony took place in the Weizmann Hall of the Jewish Agency building, where World Zionist Organization chairman Yaakov Hagoel noted that Chaim Weizmann, the founding, longtime president of the WZO, had been sworn in as president of the nascent State of Israel. A life-size photograph of that ceremony adorns one of the walls.
It was Hassan-Nahoum's third-last day as deputy mayor of Jerusalem - a position in which she had served with distinction, but Mayor Moshe Lion was conspicuously absent. Among those who did attend were Michelle Cohen, the ambassador of the Dominican Republic, Ifat Ovadia-Luski, who happens to the first chairwoman of Keren Kayemet LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund, as well as a former CEO of World Likud; historian, fervent Zionist, and Jerusalem Post columnist Gil Troy; Kol Yisrael chairman David Yaari; Rabbi Leor Sinai, head of the Youth Aliyah subcommittee at the Jewish Agency; Olga Israel Deutsch, vice president of NGO Monitor; and Max Meyer, Kol Yisrael delegate to the World Zionist Congress and head of the Danish Zionist Federation of Youth.
Even though the building in which the ceremony took place represents the pulse and beating heart of the Zionist enterprise, nearly all the speeches were in English, not in Hebrew.
Including the gender issue in his remarks, Hagoel said that Theodor Herzl, the founder of the Zionist movement, believed in equality and equal opportunity.
Looking around, Troy said that he was pleased to be in a room where Zionism was kosher. So many people say that Zionism has failed, he continued, but he thinks that October 7 was a vindication of Zionism and how it brought people of different viewpoints together, to build and rebuild.
Troy reminded his audience that ""we are a people, not just a religion.""
In lauding Hassan-Nahoum, he said: ""We have a cheerleader, a visionary who cares."" Troy is certain that Hassan-Nahoum will prove to the enemies of Israel and the Jewish people that ""we are more powerful than they think we are.""
Yaari, who persuaded Hassan-Nahoum to take on her new role, is certain that she will breathe new life into the organization. ""Zionism is today a rallying cry,"" he said.
Because the world now moves at a faster pace than in the past, he is also certain that with Hassan-Nahoum on board, Kol Yisrael will evolve much more quickly than anticipated. After all, it took only 50 years for a ""crazy idea"" like Herzl's to evolve from the First Zionist Congress in 1897 into a state in 1948.
Humbled by the task that lies ahead of her, Hassan-Nahoum said she feels privileged to be taking it on at this time, because before October 7 ""we were so divided.""
Since then, people have come together despite their diversity and their differences, creating a reason to move forward with optimism.
* WOULD YOU believe that one of the languages frequently heard in Berlin bars is Yiddish?
For want of a better description, Yiddish could best be described as cockney German. There are various German dialects, so there's no reason for Yiddish not to be one of them, considering its similarity to German.
Be that as it may, there is a wonderful article in The Forward by Rosamond van Wingarden in which she writes about the shmueskrayz, or conversation group, which, since early 2022, has been meeting every two weeks in bars around Berlin.
Participants, whose native languages vary, include people with academic degrees in Yiddish, as well as people whose Yiddish is more limited. But the group gives everyone the opportunity to speak Yiddish in a more informal manner outside the classroom.
Founded by Yiddish translator Jake Schneider via Yiddish.Berlin, the group is made up of small gatherings of six to 14 people sitting around a table and schmoozing in Yiddish, and sometimes making up new words. That's a great way to revive a language which since 1945 has allegedly been dying.
Their conversation often attracts other patrons at nearby tables, who try to guess what kind of ""German"" they are speaking, and are surprised to discover that it's actually Yiddish.
One of the secrets of its success is that the meetings are held in bars where participants can drink a glass of wine while chatting or singing Yiddish songs. In other words, they're having fun.
* AMONG THE people gathered in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv last Saturday night was Julie Fisher, who is visiting from the US and catching up with many of the friends she made when living in Israel for more than a decade. As the wife of US ambassador Dan Shapiro, she took up many causes, and kept on doing that after he had completed his service.
She had a heartbreaking meeting at Hostages Square with the two daughters of Ron Benjamin, who is among the hostages being held in Gaza.
* ON THE previous morning in Hostages Square, there was a gathering attended by many people who were draped in Ukrainian flags to mark their sympathy with Ukraine on the second anniversary of Russia's aggression. The diplomatic community, which was well represented, included the ambassador of Japan, Mizushima Koichi.
The event was organized by the Friends of Ukraine with the support of the Ukrainian Embassy.
* PERHAPS THE greatest tragedy of an ongoing war, in addition to the number of casualties, is that the world at large tends to stop being concerned about it.
That has not quite happened with regard to Russia's war against Ukraine, but were it not for the two-year anniversary last weekend, it's doubtful that Ukraine would continue to be making headlines this week.
Political pundits say that the war is more against the United States and the West in general than it is against Ukraine per se. That, they say, is one of the main reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that he will keep the war going.
Political commentators have also stated that were it not for the Russia-Ukraine war, Hamas would not have attacked Israel. That may sound far-fetched to some. On the other hand, October 7 happens to be Putin's birthday.
Next month, Russia will hold presidential elections, which it claims to be democratic. But there are growing numbers of Russians who want to see Putin removed from the pinnacle of power, particularly after the cruel treatment accorded to opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison under suspicious circumstances in mid-February.
It's unlikely that democracy will win the day. Due to an amendment to the law, Putin may retain his place in the Kremlin for another two six-year terms. On the other hand, if he and former US president Donald Trump are each returned to office, Putin may finally stop the aggression against Ukraine, because unlike his relationship with present incumbent Joe Biden, he and Trump are buddy-buddy.
* TWO YEARS have passed since IsraAID, Israel's leading nongovernmental humanitarian aid group, began supporting people affected by the crisis between Russia and Ukraine.
A press release put out by the organization this week stated that 14.6 million people are still in urgent need of humanitarian aid.
IsraAID has built strong partnerships with governmental offices and officials, local NGOs, and local communities to supply aid in public health, mental health, psychosocial support, and water, sanitation, and hygiene. People continue to face daily crises within the wider context of the war.
IsraAID was among the first international aid groups to arrive on the Moldova-Ukraine border, just days after the beginning of the war, and immediately began supporting refugees crossing to safety. By July 2022, the organization was operating across three countries - Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania - delivering essential aid supplies, medical support, and psychosocial support to vulnerable and displaced communities.
IsraAID continues to support thousands of vulnerable Ukrainians every day. The organization has trained more than 250 facilitators for child-friendly spaces across Ukraine's south and east; provided more than 9 million liters of safe water for residents and displaced people who have been completely cut off from water infrastructure in the Mykolaiv region; trained more than 135 psychologists to work in Ukrainian hospitals, integrating mental health into Ukraine's medical system for the first time; and trained more than 500 first responders and police officers in first aid in crises, and provided comprehensive first aid kits. It also runs public health programs on primary healthcare.
Mental health needs are on the rise as Ukrainians continue to face daily crises.
""For the last two years, we've partnered with dozens of local nonprofits and government officials to build a network of support for affected Ukrainian communities,"" said IsraAID Ukraine's country director Alena Druzhynina.
""All this has been made possible by the dedication of the organization's Ukrainian team, and the inspiring resilience of the Ukrainian people. Roughly four million Ukrainians are still internally displaced, with 14.6 million, or 40% of the population, in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Dire economic conditions are taking a physical and emotional toll on civilians, as people who once had the resources to help one another find that they, too, need help.
""IsraAID is committed to supporting Ukrainian communities for as long as needed - not just the immediate needs, but on the long road to recovery.""
* FOR YEARS now, Israel has claimed that results in the Eurovision Song Contest are politically motivated. This has been strenuously denied by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and in some cases that denial is valid - particularly taking into account that Israel has won the competition four times.
Given the furor surrounding Israel's current entry and the strong possibility that it may be disqualified on the grounds that there is political content in the lyrics, Israel's first Eurovision winner, Izhar Cohen, who triumphed in 1975 with ""A-Ba-Ni-Bi"", has been interviewed by numerous media outlets in Israel and abroad.
Cohen thinks that the current entry is appropriate and has praised Israel's representative, Eden Golan, as a powerful singer who can definitely hold her own. Even in the year he won, he said, he was accompanied 24/7 by a member of the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), who shared his hotel room with a cocked pistol by his side
Israeli contestants are always surrounded by heavy security, said Cohen.
In Golan's case, if the dispute between KAN 11 and the EBU can be settled, the security will be even tighter, because Malmo in Sweden, where Eurovision will be held this year, is a hotbed of antisemitism and anti-Israel incitement.
Gil Omer, who chairs the board of KAN, the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, refuses to change the lyrics of the song or to replace it with another.
Culture and Sport Minister Miki Zohar is of the same mind and has urged the EBU to desist from allowing politics to interfere with art.
President Isaac Herzog has also weighed in on the matter, and, speaking at the annual Jerusalem Conference this week, suggested that being wise is preferable to being right, meaning that being right may exclude Israel from participating in this year's Eurovision contest, whereas being wise and compromising by changing the lyrics or offering a different song would enable Israel to send a message to the world.
Herzog believes that Israel's participation is important because millions of people from around the globe watch the show on television or social media platforms.
* THE B'SHEVA media group, which hosts the Jerusalem Conference, each year gives out Jerusalem Prizes to people in different categories.
Of the recipients, there were only two who were actually born and raised in Jerusalem.
Well-known broadcaster Ayala Hasson, who received the Jerusalem Prize for Communications, grew up in the neighborhood of Talpiot, which during her youth was nowhere near as developed as it is today.
The other native Jerusalemite, Rabbanit Puah Steiner, who was awarded the Jerusalem Prize for Literature, has the distinction of being a seventh-generation Jerusalemite, who in her youth lived in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City.
She recalls the siege of the Old City during the War of Independence and the period before the founding of the Israel Defense Forces.
* ARGUABLY THE most active and most visible presidential couple since the establishment of the state, the Herzogs participate in a huge variety of activities involving representatives of every sector of society. They attend numerous events around the country, and host many more at the President's Residence.
Among the International Women's Day events in which Michal Herzog will participate is one that is titled ""Their Stage,"" cohosted by Israel Hayom at Tel Aviv Port, where citations will be awarded to several outstanding women in different fields. Also present will be Israel Hayom owner and publisher Miriam Adelson. The event will be broadcast live.
* VOLUNTEERS OF the Snir Association, the management of Hazahav Shopping Mall in Rishon Lezion, popular children's entertainment star RoyBoy, and the Jewish community of Melbourne combined their efforts on behalf of 300 evacuees who are being accommodated at the Island Hotel in Netanya.
Together they orchestrated a fun day in which there were various activities for children, including a performance by RoyBoy, plus a free of charge store in which adults were given huge bags in which to take away whatever they wanted without paying a single agora.
Stores within the mall had donated new clothing, underwear, shoes, essentials for babies, and much more.
Snir Association chairman Nir Shmuel said that everyone in the association was pleased to be able to bring some pleasure to the evacuees and to be of service to people who had been taken from their homes in the middle of the night from places such as Kiryat Shmona and Sderot.
The association had begun working with the Hazahav Mall from the very beginning of the crisis, he said. ""Our goal is to bring some joy to the evacuees.... As soon as we began working with the Hazahav Mall, we began collecting merchandise, and store proprietors were extremely generous with their donations.""
The mall's CEO, Yossi Legziel, said that everyone in the mall was proud to be associated with the Snir Association's initiative, and was happy to cooperate.
Sharon Saida, the general manager of the Island Hotel, welcomed the opportunity to work with the Snir Association to provide yet another perk to help brighten the lives of the evacuees.
Snir Association CEO Dr. Yehudit Rubinstein thanked everyone involved, but especially the Jewish community of Melbourne, which, though geographically distant, was close in its heartfelt concern, expressed in what it provided for both soldiers and civilians.
* MORE THAN a century ago, poet Joyce Kilmer wrote a poem called ""Trees,"" which later evolved into a beautiful song, the opening lines of which are: ""I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree."" The imagery in the lines that follow contains all the beauty that emanates from a tree.
It's not often that a luxury hotel asks its guests to contribute to a tree-planting project. But given the time and the circumstances, the Kempinski hotel management asked guests and friends to follow its example, and together they donated ten thousand trees this month for the purpose of planting a forest near Kibbutz Be'eri, to be named the David Kempinski Forest, in memory of the victims murdered by Hamas on October 7.
The project was conducted within the framework of the hotel's cooperation with KKL-JNF to rehabilitate the Gaza border communities.
Guy Klaiman, the hotel's CEO, invited leading travel agents and employee representatives to help him plant the trees.
Members of the Royal Thai Embassy will plant a smaller but still significant number of 70 trees to mark the 70h anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Thailand. The Thai tree-planting ceremony will take place in the Ben-Shemen Forest on March 12.
* THE NEGATIVE rhetoric against Israel by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan does not mean that Turkish Jews have to flee the country. Turkey has actually been quite good in protecting the safety of its Jewish communities, and has also permitted Jewish construction and restoration projects, such as the ancient Izmir synagogues dating from the 16th century.
Of 34 synagogues built in Izmir, 13 have remained, nine of them in the old city. Some are still in reasonably good shape and have active congregations. They are not all in the same style, but represent different eras from the Spanish Golden Age onward, and serve as monuments dedicated to a once flourishing Sephardi Jewish community.
The Izmir Project, established several years ago by the Jewish community and the Mordechai Kiriaty Foundation, has worked toward the creation of an open Jewish Museum of Izmir Jewish Heritage by restoring those ancient synagogues that were in need of repair and linking them with those synagogues that have been maintained.
On Thursday, February 29, at 3 p.m., Uri Bar-Ner, on behalf of the Kiriaty Foundation, will deliver a PowerPoint presentation of the project as it stands today and as it is envisaged in its Jewish Museum context.
Those synagogues that have been preserved, as well as those that have been restored, are accessible to visitors to Turkey.
Ben-Ner will show images of these magnificent structures at the Saraya building, 23 David Raziel Street, in the Clock Tower Square in Jaffa.
The Saraya building serves as the Turkish Cultural Center, and is reminiscent, in its architecture and decor, of the days of Ottoman rule.

An Israeli offensive in Rafah

Up to this point, Israel and Egypt have managed to navigate the challenges posed by the conflict, albeit with some difficulty. However, Netanyahu's directive to the military to formulate a plan for eradicating Hamas's battalions in Rafah, including the evacuation of civilians from the area - a task that would entail the IDF regaining control of the Philadelphi Corridor - may prove overly ambitious. In reality, the plan has already been devised and is pending approval by the cabinet.
In the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Israel and Egypt share several strategic objectives. They aim to defeat Hamas or significantly diminish its political and military power. Egypt views Hamas as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood - an organization that had been outlawed and suppressed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Both countries seek to restore stability to the Gaza Strip and the wider region. Egypt has suffered significant economic setbacks, including a sharp decline in tourism and in income from fees for transiting the Suez Canal, due to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
Israel and Egypt both aim to demonstrate to the Arab world the destabilizing effects of supporting the Shia axis. They envision a new Sunni-led regional order, supported by the United States, to counterbalance the influence of Iran and its allies.
At the same time, there are conflicts of interest between Israel and Egypt.
From the Egyptian perspective, Israel taking control of the Philadelphi Corridor while ""encouraging the migration of Gazans to Egypt,"" as several Israeli politicians have stated, constitutes a red line.
Similarly, the two states are in disagreement over what should happen after the war. While Egypt supports the return of an ""upgraded"" PA to rule Gaza, Israel has expressed opposition to the return of the PA in any form. Israel has also said that the IDF will not rule over the Gaza Strip - but has not specified who will.
Regarding the future of the West Bank. While Egypt, the Arab states, the United States, and the international community support the unification of the West Bank with the Gaza Strip and the establishment of a Palestinian state led by an upgraded PA, Israel remains opposed to such an outcome. These conflicts of interest, however, are not currently a threat to the stability of Egyptian-Israeli relations.
At present, the primary concern revolves around Rafah. From a military standpoint, Israel aims to eliminate the Hamas battalions in Rafah and gain control over the Philadelphi Corridor to block Hamas's smuggling tunnels. Egypt seeks to broker a deal to secure the release of hostages and halt the war, at least temporarily, to ward off the nightmarish scenario of Palestinian refugees flooding Sinai. To this end, and with Israel's participation, Cairo hosted an important meeting - which so far has not yielded any results.
With Israel unwilling to sign a deal at just any price, an Israeli military operation in Rafah following a collapse of negotiations is a very real and frightening possibility from an Egyptian perspective. Were it to occur, such a scenario would be viewed by the public and by certain governmental circles in Egypt as the outcome of an Israeli policy targeted at expelling the Palestinians from Gaza.
In the meantime, Egypt is attempting to solve the problem by threatening both Hamas and Israel. Egypt has told Hamas that Israel will attack Rafah if it does not agree to a deal within two weeks. This threat would seem to imply agreement with an Israeli attack on Rafah if a deal is not reached - a failure that would fall on the leadership of Hamas, as it is unlikely that this time frame has been decided without coordination with Israel.
In tandem, Egypt has warned Israel against the ""disastrous consequences"" of a military operation in Rafah. Yet, at the same time, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry stated that there was no threat to the peace treaty between the two countries as they are ""actively dealing"" with the pressing issues.
For Israel, launching a military operation in Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor may create two problems. First, there are ethical concerns regarding the displacement of approximately 1.3 million Gazan refugees who would be forced, once again, to seek shelter elsewhere. Second, there are political and military implications for Egypt, particularly if masses of Palestinian refugees attempt to breach the fence and seek refuge in Sinai.
Although Egypt has been buttressing the fence recently, it would be difficult to control large numbers of desperate refugees looking to escape the fighting. In such a scenario, Egypt would face the dilemma of either resorting to the use of force against the crowds and risking accusations of betrayal and abandonment of the Palestinians or allowing them entry and placing the blame on Israel, leading to a crisis in diplomatic relations that could result in Egypt recalling its ambassador or even taking a more serious step.
Looking at it from another angle, Israel could potentially enhance its relationship with Egypt by facilitating aid from the international community and Arab states to bolster the Egyptian economy.
A historical precedent worth considering is the 1991 Gulf War, wherein Egypt's participation led to the forgiveness of approximately $20 billion in debt and favorable repayment terms for other outstanding loans. Presently, Egypt faces significant economic challenges, further aggravated by the ongoing conflict. Significant international assistance to Egypt has the potential to impact its position on key security matters concerning Israel, such as the Philadelphi Corridor and the Rafah Crossing.
In essence, while an Israeli military operation in Rafah may be deemed necessary to eradicate Hamas, it also carries the risk of deteriorating Israeli-Egyptian relations. Avoiding this scenario will demand meticulous planning for the safe relocation of Gazan refugees and close coordination between Egypt and Israel.
Yet a sober analysis would lead to the conclusion that even with such measures in place, there's no guarantee that the worst-case scenario can be entirely averted.

I have been a fundraiser in both the United States and Israel for over 15 years, dedicating my efforts to causes in Israel. Throughout this time, I've had the privilege of connecting with donors from all corners of the globe. However, the past year has been truly unprecedented.
The beginning of 2023 brought about anti-reform protests in Israel and a crisis among US donors who felt that Israel's democratic foundations were under threat.
The October 7 Hamas massacre, the ensuing Israel-Gaza War, and a sharp rise in antisemitism across the US changed everything. Amid the tragedy and heartbreak, and the shock of realizing that ""Never Again"" had indeed occurred again, the American Jewish community underwent a profound transformation, shifting from disillusionment to unwavering support for Israel almost overnight.
Jewish communities across the US and beyond swiftly mobilized to support Israel through calls, letters, social media, and fundraising. Volunteers of all ages traveled to Israel to aid hundreds of nonprofit organizations meeting critical needs on the home front. In just two months, the Jewish Federations of North America raised over $700 million in emergency funding - double the amount of the largest emergency campaign during the 2006 Second Lebanon War. Jews worldwide echoed the sentiment Am Yisrael Chai - the nation of Israel lives.
Just before the outbreak of war, I assumed the role of CEO at Friends of Alyn Hospital. Alyn, Israel's sole pediatric and adolescent rehabilitation center, was a microcosm of the outpouring of support from friends all over the world.
Alyn's famous ""Wheels of Love"" bicycle ride to raise funds and awareness for the hospital was scheduled to begin on October 23 from pastoral Kibbutz Be'eri, located one and a half miles from the Gaza border. Be'eri was decimated on October 7. Families were burned inside their homes, others were murdered, and many were brutally kidnapped to Gaza.
The ride was canceled, but this did not stop the many participants living outside of Israel to immediately organize alternate rides all over the world to raise funds for Alyn and show solidarity with Israel and the Jewish people. Alyn's ""Heels of Love"" hike, scheduled for February 27, has similarly garnered unprecedented backing.
The hospital's PELE division, which develops custom solutions for children in rehabilitation, quickly adapted to provide critical solutions for the numerous wounded soldiers undergoing rehabilitation across the country. Solidarity missions, including a poignant visit from the Jewish United Fund of Metropolitan Chicago, a PELE partner, were moved to tears when they witnessed first-hand the remarkable resilience of our people.
It is unfortunate that we need a crisis of the magnitude of October 7 to bring the global Jewish community together. But at times like this, it is heartening to know that we are not alone in our mission. It is profoundly moving to know that our brothers and sisters in the US and all over the world have stepped up in the most remarkable way, demonstrating the true power of compassion and unity.
This moment is defining for Israel and the Jewish people. I extend my deepest gratitude to everyone standing shoulder to shoulder with us, united in our shared commitment to reimagining and rebuilding a brighter and more inclusive future for us all. Am Yisrael Chai.
The writer is executive director of Friends of Alyn Hospital in Jerusalem.

Brazil's Lula compares Israel to Nazis, Gaza war to Holocaust

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva compared Israel's war against Hamas to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis's murder of Jews in the Holocaust on Sunday, Brazilian media reported.
""What is happening in the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian people did not exist at any other historical moment,"" said the president. ""It existed when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.""
The October 7 massacre by Hamas, which killed over 1,200 people, has been reported as the ""deadliest day for the Jews since the Holocaust,"" as described by US President Joe Biden days after the attack and also by numerous Israeli officials and Jewish social media users.
The president stated that the deaths in Gaza are a ""massacre"" and a ""genocide,"" reports quoted him as saying.
Foreign Minister Israel Katz recalled the Brazilian ambassador to Israel for a reprimand following Lula's statements, saying, ""The words of the Brazilian president are shameful and serious. No one will harm Israel's right to defend itself.""
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided with Katz to recall the Brazilian ambassador, saying, ""This is about trivializing the Holocaust and trying to harm the Jewish people and Israel's right to defend itself. Comparing Israel to the Nazi Holocaust and Hitler is crossing a redline. Israel fights for its defense and securing its future until complete victory, and it does so while upholding international law.""
Lula made these statements in an interview with journalists at a hotel he was staying at in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The president was previously in Cairo, where he met with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The Brazilian daily newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported that the war in Gaza was the main topic of Lula's five-day trip abroad.
Lula had already criticized Israel for its ""disproportionate response"" after the Hamas attack and said that the UN Security Council ""cannot do anything in the war between Israel and [Hamas in] the Gaza Strip. The only thing it can do is ask for peace through the press, but it seems to me that Israel has the primacy of not complying with any decision made by the leadership of the United Nations.""
On Saturday, Lula had a bilateral meeting with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who previously said that Russia plans to host unity talks between all Palestinian factions in Moscow on February 26, including Hamas. Shtayyeh also said that ""one should not continue focusing on October 7,"" as he had denounced Hamas's actions on that day.
President Isaac Herzog said ""Israeli soldiers are fighting a cruel terrorist organization which has as its stated goal the annihilation of the Jewish state, and advocates the suppression of other faiths and communities such as the LGBT community, and brutally continues to hold 134 babies, women, and men hostage in the dungeons of Gaza. And yet, there are still leaders who atrociously accuse the nation-state of the Jewish people of the evil of Hitler's deeds.
""I utterly condemn such accusations and the immoral distortion of history,"" Herzog continued, ""and call on all world leaders to join me in condemning such actions unequivocally.""
Herzog noted that ""The Nazis murdered six million defenseless Jews in the Holocaust just for being Jews. Israel is now defending itself against a terrorist group that invaded the country, killed more than a thousand people, carried out mass rapes, burned people alive, and defends its founding charter, which includes the elimination of the Jewish state.""
The Yad Vashem World Holocaust Remembrance Center's chairman, Dani Dayan, said that ""Lula's shameful words are are an outrageous combination of hatred and ignorance. According to the IHRA working definition of antisemitism (an organization in which Brazil itself is looking forward to becoming a member), this is a clearly antisemitic statement. A comparison of a country fighting a terrorist organization, which massacred over 1,200 of its citizens indiscriminately, to the actions of the Nazis who murdered six million Jews deserves all condemnation. Sadly, the leader of a country descends to such a low point of extreme Holocaust distortion.""

President Joe Biden's State of the Union address on Thursday night contained many elements that should make Israelis feel good.
According to CNN figures, the American president gave more time to the Gaza war (5:21 minutes) than he gave to either the Russia-Ukraine war (3:47), America's domestic economy (4:11) or gun control (2:03) - showing how much importance he evidently places on the events surrounding our country.
Arriving at the topic late in the hour-long speech, Biden gave statements supporting Israel in its war with Hamas, calling on the ""terrorist group"" to release the Israeli hostages it is holding, and condemning sexual violence committed in its October 7 invasion and subsequent massacre of Israelis and foreign nationals, including Americans.
As Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike gave a standing ovation, Biden said: ""Here in the chamber tonight are American families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas. I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home.""
Acknowledging that Hamas is responsible for the death toll in Gaza because it ""hides and operates among the civilian population,"" Biden also laid the blame for prolonging the suffering taking place in the war-torn Strip on Hamas, saying that the terrorists ""could end this conflict today by releasing the hostages, laying down arms, and surrendering those responsible for October 7.""
That's the good stuff.
In addition to his criticism of Hamas, Biden also targeted Israel, however, with his harshest public comments yet on the government's policies in Gaza. Saying that Israel has a right to go after Hamas, Biden stressed that it must also do its part to enable aid to reach Gazans.
""Israel also has a fundamental responsibility, though, to protect innocent civilians in Gaza. This war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined,"" he said. ""Israel must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure humanitarian workers aren't caught in the crossfire. To the leadership of Israel I say this: Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip.""
However, in transmitting that necessary message, Biden also trumpeted the questionable claims from Hamas that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom are not Hamas members.
So Biden gets us, he knows what Israel has gone through since October 7. But he also knows what he needs to say about what the world sees as the urgent humanitarian situation in Gaza. The president's comments dovetail with the messages that Minister Benny Gantz reportedly received last week on his visit to Washington, where he was told in talks with senior officials that the humanitarian situation in Gaza was intolerable and that just maybe, Israel was not doing enough.
However, according to a former senior Israeli defense official who spoke with the Post's Editor in Chief Zvika Klein last week, while there is hunger in Gaza, the humanitarian crisis is overblown and is being used by Hamas to gain world sympathy.
The official said plenty of food is entering the Strip, but it has ""immediately been taken by Hamas terrorists, who then sell some of the supplies for ten times more than what they're worth.""
That claim was backed up by government spokesman Eylon Levy, who said last week that ""the problem is not getting aid into Gaza: The problem is the distribution inside Gaza.""
Israel welcomed the announcement that the US is planning to build an emergency port off the Gaza coast to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The port ""can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine, and temporary shelters,"" top US officials said.
It's possible to embrace two seemingly opposing concepts in regards to the war in Gaza: that Israel needs to decisively defeat Hamas to the point that they are no longer a threat, and that the Jewish state needs to proactively bring and enable more aid to reach the civilian population.
The US is not going to forget that. And as Israel continues to fight Hamas and work for the release of the remaining hostages, it can't afford to forget it either.

The role of Qatar in the Israel-Hamas war has been a focus of great concern, including on the pages of this newspaper. On the one hand, Qatar has played, and continues to play, a valuable role in mediating the release of Israeli hostages.
On the other hand, we cannot ignore the fact that Qatar has continued to allow the leaders of Hamas to live securely in its country. To grant asylum to men who have organized mass murder is, Qatar would have us believe, an illustration of its neutrality and of the advantages it can provide the West when they need to deal with Hamas.
It seems that in all of its solicitous dealings with Qatar, the Biden administration has forgotten the following important facts that should have been front and center following October 7 and continuing until today: More than thirty American citizens were murdered on that bloody day - and a number of Americans are still being held hostage.
Immediately after the attack, Qatar offered to be an honest broker and the Biden administration took them up on this, with Secretary of State Blinken flying to Doha and praising Qatar's efforts. Yet did anyone stop to ponder the strange situation, that while Blinken was meeting with the Qatari leaders to try to find a solution to the hostage crisis, the men responsible for it were comfortably ensconced, with full protection, not far from where these meetings were taking place?
Faced with this embarrassing scenario, what Blinken should have done, and which can still be done, is to deliver an ultimatum. Or for those who prefer a softer touch, the secretary of state can make the Qataris an offer they can't refuse, as America still has the power to make such offers: Deliver to us immediately the leaders of Hamas so they can stand trial for the murder of American citizens. If you do not do so, then as a country harboring terrorists who murdered Americans, Qatar will face the consequences, the details of which can be spelled out in private.
It is hard to see how Qatar could reject such a demand, if it is delivered with the appropriate teeth. It is even harder to accept that the United States refuses to demand the extradition of murderers of Americans, when they are so easily within reach. What kind of country have we become when we allow the murderers of our citizens to live freely, especially when a formal request for extradition, coupled with a firmness to judge Qatar by its response, will almost certainly produce the result we desire?
After the Hamas leaders are delivered to American custody, they will be held awaiting trial for their crimes. As the Hamas leadership will no doubt wish to avoid life sentences, so they can return to their lives of luxury, a simple solution is available. Qatar can negotiate the following deal: If Hamas releases the hostages, then the Hamas leadership in US custody will be freed. If Hamas refuses to do so, then the terrorist kingpins will be tried and sentenced as any other terrorist who has killed US citizens.
The writer holds the Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the University of Scranton.

The number of antisemitic incidents on college campuses in the United States since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 passed 1,000 on Monday, Adam Lehman, president and CEO of Hillel International, revealed during a joint session of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (COP) and the Knesset Committee for Immigration, Absorption, and Diaspora Affairs on Tuesday morning.
During the committee session, COP CEO William Daroff and other speakers stressed that the uptick in antisemitic incidents since the outbreak of Israel's war against Hamas shows beyond a doubt the connection between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, as Jews were being attacked for actions committed by the state of Israel.
According to Lehman, the number of antisemitic incidents marked a 700% rise since the parallel period a year earlier and 44 of these incidents were physical attacks - more than the past 10 years combined. He added that 56% of Jewish students feel unwelcome on college campuses.
To combat this, Hillel is lobbying aggressively to ensure that students are safe, and is providing legal aid to students who wish to press charges against aggressors. Hillel is also working to educate college administrators to persuade them to change policies on campus.
Harriet Schleifer, chair of the Conference of Presidents, said that the number of antisemitic incidents since October 7 among all US Jews, not just college students, rose by 360% relative to a similar period the year before. Furthermore, 46% of US Jews reported that, during the past few months, they refrained from displaying a public symbol of their Judaism out of fear of oppression.
Schleifer also said that the fears are also an opportunity to show Jewish resilience and pride, and noted that a pro-Israel March in Washington, DC in November that drew 330,000 people was a testament to this.
Carol Ann Schwartz, president of Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America, spoke about the work her organization was doing on behalf of Jewish women in the US and 20 other countries. Schwartz said that the rising levels of anti-Zionism and antisemitism were affecting women at all levels, bombarding them with fliers, graffiti, threats at synagogues and day schools, and more.
She pledged to continue to speak out about the rape and gender-based violence that Hamas perpetuated against Israeli women on October 7 and added that Hadassah was also struggling against associations of teachers in some states and communities who adopted or were trying to adopt biased resolutions against Israel.
Committee chairman MK Oded Forer (Yisrael Beytenu), opened the session by saying that Israel serves as an ""insurance policy"" for US Jewry, but that the relationship is reciprocal - and Jewish Israelis were equally strengthened by Diaspora Jewry. Forer also mentioned the contribution and sacrifice of lone soldiers in Israel's war - and said that the masses of Israelis who attend these soldiers' funerals are a testament to the appreciation Israel feels toward Jewish brethren abroad.
Yesh Atid MK Elazar Stern said during the session that, from his perspective, the war marked a turning point in which the ""start-up nation"" was no longer just Israel, but the entire Jewish people, as the Jewish Diaspora is also part of Israel's ""destiny and uniqueness,"" concepts coined by Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion. Stern added that the war surprised many Israelis in that it showed that the ""TikTok"" generation was strong and willing to fight.
Likud MK Dan Illuz also attended the session, and said that while ""October 7 marked a grim reminder of the relentless hostility we face, not only witnessing the brutality of our adversaries but also their ruthless tactics,"" there was still reason for hope: ""If we would have told our grandparents scattered around the world that 1,000 Jews were killed in a pogrom, they would have said that it is sad, but that's life. But if we would have told them that hundreds of thousands of soldiers rose to defend their people on that same day, this idea would have been beyond belief for them.""

Hamas-held hostages and moral blind spots

If I had the expressive eyebrows of Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy, there is no doubt that recent headlines would have raised them. As it was, just my blood pressure rose as I read the newspapers in the morning.
A front-page story on February 15, for instance, stated: ""The White House urged 'everyone, including Israel,' to do everything possible to reach a deal for the release of the hostages amid reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not approve of sending a delegation back to Cairo for further negotiations.""
It was one of several stories hinting that the US administration was worried that Israel was not doing everything it could to bring the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza back home. It's a theme that also has been prevalent in the Hebrew press. It is likely part of the message promoted by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, whose head consultant, Ronen Tzur, stepped down this week amid the concerns that he was using the forum for political purposes - a continuation of his previous campaigns against Netanyahu and the government's judicial reform that tore the country apart before October 7.
The American signals suggest that the administration has been listening more closely to opposition voices than the government. This in itself is disturbing. Just as Israel needs to maintain bipartisan ties in the US and work with whichever president is democratically elected, so too must the US president and administration work with Israel's democratically elected government, however distasteful they find them.
Israel does not need lectures from foreign governments about the importance of getting the hostages released. Every normal human being wants to see them returned - especially in Israel. The heartbreaking footage published this week of Shiri Bibas, barefoot and covered by a blanket, struggling to hold her baby and four-year-old as she is herded by terrorists through Khan Yunis on October 7, was another reminder of how much we can care about someone we have never met. The question is the price of a deal and the danger it presents to Israeli security and citizens in the future.
The mass release of Palestinian terrorists a la the 2011 Gilad Schalit deal clearly poses a threat: The mega-atrocity of October 7 was masterminded by Hamas's Yahye Sinwar, among those released in that deal. Hamas attempts to tie a hostage release to enabling its presence on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is even more jarring. It's not by chance that Hamas called the October 7 invasion ""The al-Aqsa Flood.""
It is not Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is holding the hostages captive. Similarly, suggestions that Netanyahu is deliberately trying to prolong the war in Gaza and drag out a hostage release for his own political purposes - to deflect attention from his legal woes and postpone elections - are political spin. Netanyahu is certainly a seasoned politician who knows a thing or two about elections and the importance of their timing - defeating Hamas and bringing as many hostages home alive can only help him.
The fate of the hostages; the threat of Hamas's continued control in Gaza; the dangers of Hezbollah in Lebanon; and the open threats from Iran acting through its terrorist proxies, including the Houthis, are issues that cut across the political spectrum in Israel. There's no Left and Right when there's an existential threat to Israel. Opposition leader Yair Lapid and Netanyahu's rivals, such as Benny Gantz, who heads the National Unity party, also undoubtedly want Israel to win the war and welcome home the hostages, even if it were to provide a temporary boost for Bibi in the polls.
I HAVE TO remind myself that the terrorist organizations are the enemy and not the UN, but it is becoming increasingly hard to distinguish between who is working for whom, in certain cases.
Last week, Martin Griffiths, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told Sky News: ""Hamas is not a terrorist group for us, as you know, it is a political movement. But, I think it is very, very difficult to dislodge these groups without a negotiated solution; which includes their aspirations...""
My blood pressure shot up and I spluttered my morning coffee over the newspaper. In an effort at damage control, Griffiths later wrote on X (formerly Twitter): ""Just to clarify: Hamas is not on the list of groups designated as terrorist organizations by the United Nations Security Council,"" adding, ""This doesn't make their acts of terror on 7 October any less horrific and reprehensible, as I've been saying all along.""
Now you understand how the UN can claim it had no knowledge of the Hamas control center, which the IDF uncovered last week, built directly under UNRWA headquarters in Gaza, using the same infrastructure. There were more shocking revelations this week - shocking, but not surprising to those who have been following the UNRWA debacle.
On Monday, video footage was released showing an UNRWA social worker loading the body of a young Israeli into a truck at Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7 and abducting the corpse to Gaza. The so-called social worker is just one of many UNRWA-affiliated officials who have been found to be involved in the atrocity in which some 1,200 were brutally slaughtered and more than 240 abducted.
This week, at another Gaza hospital, another Hamas monstrosity was revealed. Medication clearly marked with the names of Israeli hostages was discovered during the IDF operation at Nasser Hospital. The life-saving pharmaceutical aid forwarded by the families via foreign envoys did not reach the captives. It was delivered to Hamas hands in Gaza but left unopened.
The fact that it wasn't used at all underscores another point: the humanitarian disaster, which Hamas has convinced the world of, is apparently not great enough for the terrorists to distribute medications to even its own people. Similarly, a recent KAN Radio report suggested that the hundreds of trucks with humanitarian aid waiting at the Rafah crossing are being deliberately held up to worsen the crisis in Gaza and intensify pressure on Israel.
For light relief, I can share a bad joke. Russia has extended an invitation to the PLO, Hamas, and several other terrorist groups to attend unity talks in Moscow next week with the aim of getting them to put their differences aside as part of a unilateral bid for Palestinian statehood.
You might have thought that Russia was occupied with other matters - its invasion and attacks on Ukraine, for example. But, particularly following the sudden death in prison of yet another Putin opponent - Alexei Navalny - a person has to be exceptionally brave to speak out against the president and his policies in the Russian Federation.
News of the planned unity talks was announced at the Munich Security Conference by Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh. Adding insult to injury, Shtayyeh told the conference: ""One should not continue focusing on October 7.""
This is a tactic that the Palestinians - Hamas and the PLO-Fatah - do indeed have in common: carrying out a terror attack and then carrying on as if nothing happened. Another thing they share is the desire to eliminate Israel. The main difference is a matter of approach. Hamas prefers to try to destroy Israel physically through terrorism and war, while the Palestinian Authority is prepared to do it in stages, through diplomatic means. Declaring a state without agreed-on borders is a good starting point for them.
There are leaders willing to go along with this. There is pressure from Israel's friends - the US, the UK, France, and others - to move toward unilateral declaration of Palestinian independence, a prize for the Hamas attack.
And there are sworn enemies, like Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who, on the sidelines of the African Union Summit this week compared Israel's actions against the Hamas terrorist regime to Hitler's genocide of Jews in the Holocaust. There was also a move - spearheaded by Algeria and South Africa - to rescind Israel's observer status at the African Union.
It's a worrisome trend. Israel is being belittled, dismissed, and delegitimatized for defending itself while the terrorist organizations are enjoying an international push for full recognition - not despite the October 7 atrocity, but as a result of it.
For anyone who truly wants to combat the scourge of jihadist terrorism, this should raise more than eyebrows and blood pressure. It should raise red flags.

Hamas is a radical religious cult

You can eliminate a terrorist. You cannot eliminate an ideology. Ideologies morph into dogma and then into radical cults.
The Shia extremists of Iran have for the last 30 years been developing a caliphate starting in Iran travelling to Iraq, Syria then Lebanon. Their cultish goal is to eliminate every Jew in their expanding path. How they continue in their efforts is based on radical religious beliefs and the power of cult philosophies.
Leon Festinger, a psychologist who at the time worked at the University of Minnesota, decided to follow a cult that he had read about. Mrs. Keech, whose real name was Dorothy Martin, told followers that she had received messages from aliens stating that the world would end on a specific date. She attracted a large following and the group developed a beliefs-based cult called the Seekers. When the date passed without the world ending, the cult nevertheless continued, with a change in focus to proselytizing even more with the goal of attaining a larger membership.
Festinger and colleagues wrote a book about the cult titled When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World in which he advanced the theory of cognitive dissonance. In terms of cults, the theory suggests that cult members beliefs cannot be erroneous even if proven wrong. Cult members adapt to their belief failures by increasing their determination to establish and prove that they are correct. In the process they expand their membership.
While Festinger and his partners did groundbreaking work, the focus on this one group failed to explore the larger issue of cults.
This group is by no means the only one with a similar dogma. What we learn from studying other groups is that prophecies that cult members adhere to virtually never fail. The belief systems of cults are robust, even when contradicted by reality.
Regardless of the outcome of the Israel-Hamas war, Hamas, the cult that it is, will claim victory. Like all other radical cults, the level of cognitive dissonance which embodies their belief that the Hamas charter cannot be wrong has provided the impetus to expand their influence. And this cult has already set up the considerations to do so.
By attacking Israel with well-written and militarily exercised plans, threatening residents, raping and mutilating, taking hostages, and not negotiating in earnest, while adding to a cult of followers worldwide, Hamas will claim triumph.
The October 7 war started by Hamas is asymmetrical and can also be considered guerrilla warfare, which has assumed a universal character under the banner of religious fundamentalism. Unfortunately, these unconventional actors attract religious fanatics to carry out vicious terrorist attacks, the most famous being the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. An asymmetric war is one of the most difficult, challenging, and complex wars of modern times because you are fighting terrorists who have a strong religious conviction. Using their losses as a publicity stunt, they lose but win.
Hamas delights in collateral damage even to its own, a fact that should be an anathema to the world. Yet the intensity of its convictions is what attracts followers.
In contrast, Israel's challenges are compounded by the fact that Israel as a country is not a cult and therefore has virtually no support in the world, this is itself a very telling phenomenon.
In an asymmetric battlefield, where the rules are fluid - sustained, unrestrained firepower is the only way for a decisive military win.
In 2010, it was only this unrestrained firepower of the dominating Nigerian forces that led to the surrender of Boko Haram terrorist commanders; nothing else would have worked, dishonest negotiations are part of the terrorists' tools.
The Nigerian military government should be applauded for their military transformation, where deviant innovation became its battlefield education and this retooling led to the complete annihilation of the terrorist entity living among the civilians.
Henry Kissinger said that ""the guerrilla wins if he does not lose. The conventional army loses if it does not win."" This is a warning to Israeli military leadership.
It's about intelligence and planning, Israel must put itself in the mind of Hamas and Hezbollah to degrade the threat of radical cult terrorism. Presently, Israel will ""win"" this war, but it will be a Pyrrhic or hollow victory, meaning that Israel has suffered such harm that its victory will be hard to differentiate from a defeat.
Hamas's style is evident in its hesitancy to work toward a ceasefire. Israel has agreed to basic principles, but Hamas will not offer names of hostages remaining alive to move the deal forward.
Yet, the media levels blame Israel. UN officials state that UNRWA workers were coerced by Israeli officials to say that they were Hamas members without acknowledging the very real likelihood that Hamas threatened them to say that.
Hamas has spent a great deal of time and money establishing networks, with legions of followers throughout the free world who aggressively support Hamas lies all while denying real reports, to support their cultish goals. Without an effort to confront the beliefs and character of the radicals in Hamas, Hezbollah, and others, battlefield success will be paltry as the cults will continue to attract believers.

US urges Hamas to accept hostage deal

The White House called on Hamas to accept a hostage deal that would allow some of the remaining 134 hostages to be freed and put in place a six-week pause to the war.
""Israel has put a forward-leaning deal on the table,"" US National Security Communication Advisor John Kirby. ""They have made an offer here. And the onus is on Hamas to accept it.""
He added that he remained hopeful that the deal would be in place by the start of the Ramadan on March 10.
""The goal here is to get this done as soon as possible. And certainly, we'd like to see it done before Ramadan begins,"" Kirby said.
Hamas and Egyptian mediators said on Monday they were pressing on with talks on securing a ceasefire in Gaza, despite Israel's decision not to send a delegation.
The ceasefire talks, which began on Sunday in Cairo, are billed as a final hurdle on the way to securing the first extended ceasefire of the five-month-old war, in time for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, expected to begin on Sunday.
Israel has declined to comment publicly on the Cairo talks. A source told Reuters Jerusalem was staying away because Hamas refused a request to list the hostages that are still alive, information that the terror group which controls Gaza said they will provide only once terms are agreed.
""Talks in Cairo continue for the second day, regardless of whether the occupation's delegation is present in Egypt,"" a Hamas official told Reuters.
Two Egyptian security sources said mediators were in touch with the Israelis, allowing negotiations to continue despite their absence.
A Palestinian source close to the talks said the discussions remained ""uneasy,"" with Israel sticking to its demand for only a temporary truce to free hostages, while Hamas was seeking assurances that the war would not start up again.
Late on Monday, officials from Hamas, Egypt, and Qatar began a second round of talks for the day, a Hamas source said.
The proposal being discussed envisages a truce of about 40 days, during Hams would release around 40 of the more than 100 hostages they are still holding, in return for some 400 Palestinian security prisoners and terrorists from Israeli jails.
Kirby told reporters that what was being discussed in this six-week deal was the release of ""vulnerable, wounded, elderly female hostages.""
During an initial release of hostages in November in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, ""the list of hostages and a list of Palestinian prisoners... was part of the last deal and you can certainly imagine that that's a part of this deal, too.
""Now, in this case, we're talking about more, more on more of both over a longer period of time,"" with several exchanges over six weeks.
""A list of names is part of that"" conversation for a deal, he said. ""We obviously want all the hostages returned to their families, and we recognize that it's likely that not all of them are still alive.""
As part of the emerging second deal, Israeli troops would pull back from some areas, more humanitarian aid would be allowed into Gaza, and residents would be permitted to return to abandoned homes.
But the deal does not appear to address directly a Hamas demand for a path to a permanent end to the war. Nor does it resolve the fate of more than half the remaining hostages - Israeli men excluded from both this and earlier agreements covering women, children, the elderly, and the wounded.
Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is eradicated. Hamas says it will not free all its hostages without a deal that ends the war.
The Egyptian security sources said mediators were trying to bridge the gap with guarantees to Hamas on future peace talks, and to Israel on the safety of hostages.
A Palestinian official close to the negotiations disputed the US contention that Israel had already agreed to the deal and Hamas was holding it up, saying this appeared aimed at deflecting blame from Israel should the talks collapse.
The war erupted after Hamas terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting 253 hostages.
In response, and to free the hostages and dismantle Hamas's military capabilities, the IDF launched a military operation. Hamas has assured that over 30,000 people have been killed and most of the population has been made homeless. Israel has said that at least 11,000 of the fatalities are combatants.
A Ramadan truce could head off a threatened Israeli military campaign in Rafah, the last town on the southern edge of Gaza where Hamas battalions are active, where more than half the enclave's population are now sheltering.
The US also hopes that a Gaza truce would help ensure a diplomatic resolution to the cross-border violence between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein said on Monday that a truce in Gaza would not necessarily bring an automatic end to hostilities across Lebanon's southern border and he warned about the risks of an escalation of the conflict.
""Escalation of violence is in no one's interest, and there is no such thing as a limited war,"" he told reporters after meeting Lebanon's parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who is close to Hezbollah.
Hochstein said friction on the border had increased in recent weeks.
""A temporary ceasefire is not enough. A limited war is not containable,"" he said.
Lebanon deputy parliament speaker Elias Bou Saab told Reuters he believed the timing of Hochstein's visit signaled progress in efforts over a Gaza truce.
Hezbollah has publicly indicated that it would halt its attacks on Israel from Lebanon when the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip stops unless Israel kept shelling Lebanon.
But Hochstein said a Gaza truce would not automatically trigger calm in southern Lebanon and said he was ""hopeful"" for a diplomatic solution to the conflict across that border.
""It does not necessarily happen that when you have a ceasefire in Gaza, it just automatically extends"" to Lebanon, he said.

Israel wants administrators ‘without Hamas or PA links’ to run Gaza

Body


Israeli officials have said they want to use local administrators without links to either Hamas or the Palestinian Authority to run Gaza , and will set up small scale trials of the scheme as soon as “the right people step up to the plate”.
The controversial plan, which would see Israel retaining security control throughout Gaza, comes amid a deepening breakdown in public order in the devastated territory as convoys of aid are repeatedly looted and local communities form self-defence groups, some armed, to protect against thieves or help find food.
Earlier this week, the World Food Programme halted food deliveries to northern Gaza because of increasing chaos and renewed fighting. The agency has warned of catastrophic famine if aid does not reach people in need. UN secretary general, António Guterres, said that in north Gaza, one in six children under two years old is acutely malnourished.
The heads of 13 UN agencies and five other aid groups issued a joint plea for a ceasefire late on Wednesday, warning that a looming Israeli offensive on the southern city of Rafah would bring “mass casualties” and could “deal a death blow” to a humanitarian operation bringing aid to Palestinians that “is already on its knees”.
“Diseases are rampant. Famine is looming,” the plea said, adding that aid workers are facing “shelling, death, movement restrictions and a breakdown of civil order”.
The foreign ministers of 26 European countries on Thursday also called for a pause in fighting leading to a longer ceasefire. They urged Israel not to take military action in Rafah “that would worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian situation”.
Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza has killed more than 29,400 people and wounded more than 69,000, Gaza’s Health Ministry said on Thursday. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but has said that about two-thirds of the dead are women and children.
The war in Gaza was triggered when Hamas launched attacks into Israel on 7 October that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their homes and at a music festival. The militant organisation abducted 250 hostages, of whom about 100 were released in a swap for Palestinian prisoners during a week-long ceasefire in November.
Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas saying it uses Gaza residents as a human shield.
On Thursday, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli’s prime minister, restated his determination to achieve “total victory”.
“We are on the way to eliminating Hamas and releasing our hostages. We will not relent until we achieve total victory,” he told soldiers in northern Israel.
Netanyahu has refused to make detailed concrete proposals for the administration of Gaza after the end of the current conflict and has so far ruled out calls to allow the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority to govern both Gaza and the occupied West Bank – Washington’s preferred option. 
Israel has instead suggested some form of governance involving local power brokers or clans, with the Israel Defense Forces playing a significant supervisory role. Working groups of academics, senior soldiers and officials have been convened to consider ways of administrating Gaza.
One Israeli official said the planned “humanitarian pockets” would be in districts of the Gaza Strip from which Hamas has been expelled, but that their ultimate success would rely on Israel achieving its goal of destroying the militant Islamist organisation everywhere in the territory.
“We’re looking for the right people to step up to the plate,” the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. “But it is clear that this will take time, as no one will come forward if they think Hamas will put a bullet in their head.”
Israel says it will have indefinite security control over Gaza after the war, but denies this would be a reoccupation.
The plan, the official added, “may be achieved once Hamas is destroyed and doesn’t pose a threat to Israel or to Gazans”.
Few analysts believe that Hamas can be completely driven from Gaza, and many predict a long-running insurgency.
After five months of conflict, much of the south of the territory is still run by Hamas, and there is already evidence that its leaders have made efforts to rebuild  the militant organisation’s influence in the north. In late January, Hamas officials detained and punished thieves in Jabaliya, a stronghold in northern Gaza where Israeli forces fought fierce battles last year.
Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of Political Science at Gaza’s al-Azhar University but currently based in Cairo, described the new Israeli plan as an “illusion”.
“[The Israelis] might find some people who are willing to do this dirty job but the people they are looking for will be seen as a collaborators or spies and so as legitimate targets for being killed. There might be a few Palestinians ready to do this but they will need an Israeli battalion to protect them,” he said.
Israeli media reported that a trial of the plan, under which local merchants and civil society leaders would distribute humanitarian aid, could be launched in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of northern Gaza City.
The Israeli military would provide peripheral security in Zeitoun under the plan, the reports said, describing renewed troop incursions there this week as aimed at destroying remnants of Hamas forces.
Hamas said the new plan, which the Israeli official said would also exclude anybody on the payroll of the PA, was doomed to failure. “We are confident this project is pointless and is a sign of confusion and it will never succeed,” Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official told Reuters.
There was also fresh violence in the occupied West Bank, where three Palestinian gunmen opened fire on morning traffic at a highway checkpoint on Thursday, killing one person and wounding five others, Israeli police said.
In a statement, Hamas praised the attack and said it was a “natural response” to Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza and raids in the West Bank, and called for more attacks until they can achieve a “fully sovereign” Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Tensions are rising in the West Bank ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which in the past has seen increased clashes, often in connection to restrictions imposed on Palestinian worshippers going to Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City during the holy month.
Israel’s hardline national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has called for tight restrictions on Muslim prayers this year, including limits on Palestinian citizens of Israel.
Further signalling wider regional fallout, a missile attack damaged a vessel passing through the Gulf of Aden off Yemen on Thursday, two maritime agencies and the US military said.
The Iran-backed Huthi rebels, who control much of Yemen, have carried out months of attacks on merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, disrupting the key shipping routes.

Highlight: Apartment block bombed, killing 26, in area civilians were urged to flee to for their safetyIsrael-Hamas war – live update
Body


Israel bombed an apartment block in southern Gaza early on Saturday, killing 26 people, soon after announcing plans to intensify operations in areas where the Israeli military had told civilians to flee for their safety.
In the north, a column of medics, patients and refugees trudged out of al-Shifa hospital, the biggest in Gaza, where Israeli troops spent a fourth day searching for evidence of a Hamas command node it claimed was buried below the wards.
Five doctors stayed behind, a skeleton staff to care for 120 patients too weak or ill to move. Hamas authorities claimed Israel’s military ordered everyone to leave the hospital. A spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they facilitated an evacuation requested by medical staff.
Those walking south under the tense gaze of Israeli troops, through a hellscape of tangled rubble that had been buildings two months ago, along roads shattered by weapons and churned to mud by tanks, had little hope of rest when they reached the south.
Shelters are crammed, food and water supplies are so low the UN has warned Gazans face the “immediate possibility” of starvation , infectious diseases are spreading, and the war there is expected to intensify in coming days.
When Israeli planes hit northern Gaza at the start of the war, and troops prepared to move in on foot, Israeli messages urged civilians to move south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands for their own safety.
Despite risks on the journey, and severe overcrowding in shelters and private homes, hundreds of thousands followed those orders. About 1.6 million people are displaced, more than two-thirds of Gaza’s population, the UN said.
They found only relative safety there. Forty days into the war, 3,676 people had been killed in southern areas that Israel had declared safer. They accounted for a third of all Palestinian deaths in the conflict, according to a UN map  using figures from Gazan health authorities.
Now many of those people have been told to move again, and cram into an even smaller area along the coast, around the town of Mawasi.
“They asked us, the citizens of Gaza, to go to the south. We went to the south. Now they are asking us to leave. Where do we go?” Atya Abu Jab told Reuters, outside the tent where his family who fled Gaza City now live, one of a long row of makeshift homes.
On Saturday morning, bombs hit a multi-storey block in Hamad City, a middle-class housing development in Khan Younis, killing 26 people and injuring 23 more. A few miles north, six Palestinians were killed in an attack on a house in Deir Al-Balah town.
Eyad Al-Zaeem lost his aunt, her children and her grandchildren, who he said had evacuated from north Gaza on Israeli army orders. “All of them were martyred. They had nothing to do with the (Hamas) resistance,” Zaeem said, standing outside the morgue at Nasser hospital.
Israel’s chief military spokesperson, Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, said on Friday that the country’s troops would attack “wherever Hamas exists, including in the south of the strip”. He told journalists: “We are determined to advance our operation”.
This week Netanyahu admitted in an interview that the war was taking a heavy toll on civilians in Gaza, but blamed Hamas for the deaths. “That’s what we’re trying to do: minimal civilian casualties. But unfortunately, we’re not successful,” he told CBS.
It is not clear where civilians might go to escape fighting if it intensifies in the south. Gaza was already densely populated before the current fighting began on 7 October, triggered by Hamas attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians.
The enclave of 365 sq km was home to 2.3 million people. Now the north has largely emptied, most of those people are in the south, in private homes or overcrowded UN shelters.
Aid agencies have said they are already unable to provide food, water and medical care to people there, because of shortages of fuel, communications problems and blocks on letting humanitarian supplies pass into Gaza.
Those problems would be exacerbated if civilians were told to retreat into a smaller area, pushing up the indirect toll of the war. Security officials inside Israel have also been open that they expect civilian deaths, already at unprecedented levels, to rise higher as fighting shifts into more crowded areas.
“There will probably be more civilian casualties,” Giora Eiland, a former head of Israel’s national security council, told Reuters. “It is not going to deter us or prevent us from moving forward.”
On Friday, the toll from Hamas-run health authorities was updated to more than 12,000 dead, including 5,000 children. The UN deems those figures credible, based on verification processes in past conflicts in Gaza.
Some inside Gaza and across the region fear Israel aims to push Palestinians out of their devastated enclave entirely, seeking a new Nakba, the Arabic term for the forcible expulsion of about 750,000 Palestinians from what was previously British mandate-controlled Palestine during the creation of Israel in 1948.
A week ago Avi Dichter, a member of the Israeli security cabinet member and agriculture minister, said  in a television interview: “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba.” Netanyahu warned cabinet ministers the next day to choose their words carefully.
Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, was among regional leaders who said at a security summit in Bahrain that Israel should not try to push Gazans out of the territory, saying Jordan would do “whatever it takes to stop” the displacement of Palestinians.
“We will never allow that to happen; in addition to it being a war crime, it would be a direct threat to our national security.”
Violence continued to surge across the occupied West Bank.
An Israeli airstrike at 2am on Saturday killed five and wounded two other people at an office of the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party in Nablus. In a statement, the IDF said it had struck “a hideout used by terrorists involved in planning imminent terror attacks against Israeli civilians and military targets”.
The strike was carried out by one of its aircraft, it added, without specifying the type. The use of a warplane marked an escalation of Israeli tactics.
Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an armed faction affiliated with Fatah, claimed the five dead as its fighters and thousands attended funerals in Balata camp on Saturday morning. Amid the mourners, dozens of armed men fired in the air.
The oldest among those killed was 40; the youngest was 15. The family of the dead teenager, named as Mohammed al-Musseimi, said he had been walking past the office when the airstrike took place and was not a member of any armed group.
“He was just an innocent kid, he was just passing by,” an aunt of Musseimi said.
Israeli officials said the dead included a “prominent terrorist” involved in past attacks in Israel.
“Zahed took part in the hostile terror activity in the Balata Camp and founded a terrorist cell composed of the camp’s youth, which he armed with explosives and weapons for terror activities against IDF soldiers entering the camp,” the IDF statement read. There was no independent confirmation of the claim.
Elsewhere there were clashes near Ramallah, in Jericho and in East Jerusalem.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and as many as 2,000 detained amid a strict clampdown. Israeli officials say the arrests have thwarted several significant attacks.
Israeli security forces also shot dead an attacker near Hebron after he opened fire on soldiers on Friday morning. On Thursday, an Israeli soldier was killed at a checkpoint on the West Bank’s route 60.
On Saturday, the ISF said it had suspended a soldier who threw a stun grenade into a mosque in the village of Budrus, north-west of Ramallah, during morning prayers.

Body


Good morning.
The blast at al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza on Tuesday night is an inflection point that could change the trajectory of the Israel-Hamas war. According to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, 471 Palestinians were killed and more than 314 people were wounded. The White House national security council has said in a statement that “hundreds” of civilians were killed. At the time of the explosion, the hospital was crowded with casualties. Emma Graham-Harrison’s report  from Jerusalem unsparingly details the chaos that ensued after the explosion. 
The blast sparked widespread international condemnation and protests have erupted across the Middle East  and north Africa. The Hamas side blamed an Israeli airstrike for the tragedy, while the Israeli military produced evidence that it said showed the blast was the result of a rocket that was launched by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad and misfired. That group has denied responsibility.
The fallout has been far-reaching. After a meeting with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the US president, Joe Biden, was supposed to meet the Jordanian and Egyptian heads of state and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas. However, after the blast at the hospital the meetings were cancelled.
For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Ruth Michaelson, reporting from Israel and the Palestinian territories for the Guardian, about the likely consequences of the hospital blast and how it could affect the next stages of the conflict.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            Israel-Hamas war  | About 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid will enter Gaza  from Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula in the coming days, according to the White House, after President Joe Biden’s whirlwind visit to Israel that came in the aftermath of a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza.
                                            Police  | The Metropolitan police have admitted that a 13-year-old boy  playing with a water pistol was rammed off his bike by armed police, knocked to the ground and officers pointed their submachine guns at him.
                                            Dangerous dogs  | People are already handing in  XL bully dogs, with some requesting that their pet be put down, after the government’s announcement of an impending ban, MPs have been told.
                                            Arts  | The British Museum was the “victim of an inside job” when approximately 2,000 artefacts were stolen from its collections, the chair of trustees, George Osborne, has said. 
                                            NHS  | Naga Munchetty has said she spent decades being failed, gaslit and “never taken seriously”  by doctors, despite suffering debilitatingly heavy periods, repeated vomiting and pain so severe that she would lose consciousness. The BBC presenter, newsreader and journalist told the Commons women and equalities committee on Wednesday that she was “deemed normal” and told to “suck it up” by NHS GPs.
                   In depth: ‘What is the long term plan for civilians? What is the long term plan for Gaza as a whole?’                   
While initial reports saw Israel blaming Palestinian militants and Hamas blaming Israel, there is not conclusive evidence to be certain either way. The Guardian’s  report uses open-source information to piece together what happened at the hospital.
It is worth pointing out that it is not in the political or strategic interests of the Israeli government to have intentionally targeted the hospital. The explosion took place the night before Biden was due to arrive in Tel Aviv: a military attack like that would have made it extremely difficult for Washington to publicly offer their unequivocal support as targeting a hospital is a flagrant war crime.
The Israeli government has been finding it difficult to dispel Hamas’s claims however, partially because schools and civilian evacuation routes have reportedly been hit during airstrikes. Al-Ahli’s diagnostic cancer treatment centre was hit separately a few days before the latest explosion. Accounts vary as to who has been responsible for these.
***
                     Why Biden’s visit matters                   
The historic nature of Joe Biden’s arrival in Tel Aviv cannot be overstated – it is the first trip to Israel by an American president during an ongoing conflict, in a region gripped by unpredictable violence. The meeting was the latest public show of unwavering US support for Israel.
The cancellation of the summit with Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority put the White House in quite an “awkward” position, Ruth says, because there was now “no opportunity to have public talks with other leaders and hear concerns from elsewhere, at least”.
“There was a sense in the region that because of what happened at the hospital no leader in the Arab world could be seen to sit with Biden at this moment as it would just be too damaging for them.” Without this meeting, the US’s response could be viewed as giving Israel “carte blanche” by other countries in the Middle East.
During the meeting with Netanyahu, Biden said the deadly hospital attack appeared to be done by “the other team, not you” – though he added that there were “a lot of people out there” who weren’t sure about who was responsible for the blast. Biden did not initially elaborate on why he believed the attacks were not carried out by Israel, but did say that he was “outraged” and “deeply saddened” by the blast. Comparing Hamas to Isis, Biden also said that the group “committed evils and atrocities that make Isis somewhat more rational”. 
The US government has also since released an assessment saying Israel was not responsible.  Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, responded by saying that  “nobody is buying that narrative in this part of the world”, adding that the only thing that could change the narrative is an “independent international inquiry into the tragedy” that yields “impeccable evidence that it was not Israel”.
Netanyahu thanked Biden for his support and said Biden’s decision to visit Tel Aviv during this time was “deeply, deeply moving”. Biden reiterated that the US would give Israel anything it needed to defend itself.
***
                     How the region has reacted                   
In recent years, the urgency of supporting the Palestinian cause has started to wane among some Arab governments: the UAE and Bahrain normalised relations with Israel in 2020, as did Morocco. Saudi Arabia has been in talks to do the same. The hospital blast however has led to these countries significantly sharpening their language against Israel by issuing unequivocal condemnations and apportioning blame immediately. With a population of 450 million people across 22 countries, the Arab world is not homogenous, however many Arab people still sympathise immensely with the Palestinian cause and their governments are aware of that. “To those leaders it is too dangerous to be seen to be a public backer of Israel at this moment,” Ruth says.
This event has crystallised the already simmering anger felt in many countries, so much so that even the highly authoritarian government in Egypt has allowed people to protest against what is happening in Palestine. “This is a moment where the people want to be able to express themselves, and Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, understands what an incredibly dangerous moment that could be for him if he tries to curtail protests entirely as Egypt normally does,” Ruth says.
***
                     What could happen next                   
More than 360,000 reservists have joined the ranks of the IDF in the week and a half since the war began. The ground invasion of Gaza, which initially looked imminent, now seems to be in limbo. Not only is it clear that there would be an extremely high civilian death toll if Israel were to go ahead, Hezbollah  have also warned they would consider striking northern Israel if a ground invasion took place, meaning that the war could spill into Lebanon. Israel would struggle to fight a war on two fronts – this scenario could also prompt a formal US intervention that could destabilise the whole region, so the stakes are incredibly high.
“There is no indication that the Israeli government has a long-term strategy for what would happen once they committed to a ground invasion,” Ruth says. “There has already been an enormous loss of life in Gaza, the Israeli state has already suffered a historic blow in the face of this awful massacre and the death of over 1,300 Israelis. So, what is the plan, even if they’re able to hold a little bit of territory, what happens afterwards? What is the long term plan for civilians? What is the long term plan for Gaza as a whole?” These are the questions that Ruth and other reporters will be looking to answer in the coming weeks and months.
                   What else we’ve been reading                                                                                        Black headteachers from across the UK have penned a message for future generations of budding school leaders. The book, Letters To a Young Generation: Aspiring School Leaders was compiled by headteacher Amanda Wilson (above), who told the Guardian  how important it is that all voices are heard and hopes the book will change current figures of Black representation in student leadership roles.Nyima Jobe, newsletters team                                                                                          Maya Goodfellow interviewed                          Naomi Klein about what she found when she investigated what she called the “mirror world”, a place where conspiracies are disseminated and leftist critiques of modern capitalism are twisted to push far-right propaganda.Nimo                                                                                          Two for one treatments are on the rise with some therapists now incorporating medium readings into the session. Alaina Demopoulos speaks to  therapists merging spiritualism with traditional therapy methods in the US and also investigates the authenticity of this new phenomenon and what it means for client wellbeing.Nyima                                                                                          Moira Donegan explains  why Republicans are finding it so hard to nominate a speaker, highlighting how individualist careerism has left the House of Representatives at a standstill.Nimo                                                                                          Jim Farber chatted to                          Cher about her upcoming Christmas album, which she was apparently vehemently against, as it seemed to be a cynical cliche for artists. She also discusses her six-decade career and how she feels about still working at 77. “Some day I won’t be able to. So, for as long as I can work, I will,” she says.Nyima                                                           Sport                   
                       Football | Reports in Italy suggest that Newcastle’s £55m summer signing Sandro Tonali has admitted to placing bets  on AC Milan matches during his time as a player at the Serie A club. Given that Tonali is cooperating with the investigation and has explained he is seeking help for what his agent terms a “gambling addiction”, he could incur a year-long ban, rather than the maximum three years possible.
                       Cricket | New Zealand beat Afghanistan by 149 runs  to extend their winning streak at the Cricket World Cup. “It was another great performance today,” said captain Tom Latham. “We were put under pressure at times when we batted but the way we were able to overcome that and put the pressure back on them in the last 10 overs was outstanding.”
                       Football | Marc Skinner lambasted the format of the Women’s Champions League qualifying rounds and said there were teams going through that “weren’t good enough”, after his Manchester United side lost 3-1 to Paris Saint-Germain  and missed out on a first appearance in the group stage.

“Don’t be consumed by rage, Biden tells Israel” – the Guardian’s splash this morning after the US president’s visit. “Biden backs Israeli offensive” says the Times while the Telegraph has “Biden: don’t repeat our mistakes after 9/11” and the Daily Mirror picks up on the same line: “Biden’s message to Israel – don’t make the same mistakes that we did”. Others take a more direct route with the story of the moment: “Biden: It wasn’t Israel”, says the Sun, in reference to the deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza. The Daily Express cites “Israel’s ‘proof’ it was NOT to blame for Gaza hospital blast”. The Daily Mail seizes on an opportunity to criticise a rival: “Israeli president blasts ‘atrocious’ BBC over Hamas”, which is about the broadcaster’s policy against using “terrorists” as a blanket term for the group. “Biden backs Israel over hospital blast but seeks to broker Gaza aid package” – that’s the Financial Times. The i has Gaza as its picture lead but its main story is “Mortgage hope: UK interest rate hike unlikely”. “11 years for £50m UK dinghy kingpin” – the Metro use a catchy appellation for a freshly convicted people smuggler.

                     Kicking out the populists: how young voters helped swing Poland’s election                   
Poland’s far-right Law and Justice party was a disaster for many of the country’s democratic institutions and the LGBT community. Now it appears voters have got rid of it. Shaun Walker reports from Warsaw. He tells Nosheen Iqbal  that if the opposition is able to form a coalition government it is likely that the new prime minister will be Donald Tusk.

                     A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad                   
The Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam has had to halt the sale of a limited edition Pokémon card that was made available at an exhibition of modern art showcasing Pokémon artists inspired by Van Gogh. Ticket touts were becoming standard practice outside the building for the past couple of weeks resulting in a notice on the website telling visitors that the Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat card will no longer be issued.
But this has not stopped exhibition goers from showing love to the art.  Security say phones have been sounding for three hours on end and there were even scenes of scrambling at one of the gift stores. The Pokémon festivities continue until 7 January next year, which include the Pokémon adventure treasure hunt and interactive drawing of Pikachu workshops.

                                                                                        On Tuesday a moment’s silence was held in Israel to                         mark 30 days since the Hamas attack on Israel  in which 1,400 people were killed. In Jerusalem on Monday night a vigil had been held with a candle lit for each victim. Relatives of the dead gathered at Jerusalem’s Wailing Wall to mark a month of mourning. The ceremony was the first religious commemoration organised at the Wailing Wall since 7 October. It was attended by Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet formed by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the attack, the deadliest the nation has suffered since its founding in 1948.                                                                                          More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza in response to the 7 October attacks,  according to figures released by the health authority in the territory. The total number of deaths now stands at 10,022, including 4,104 children. The number of casualties in Gaza has not been independently verified.                                                                                          Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel  may consider “tactical little pauses” in fighting to allow the entry of aid or the exit of hostages from the Gaza Strip, but he again rejected calls for a ceasefire.  When asked who should govern the territory after fighting ends, the Israeli prime minister told  ABC news in an interview broadcast on Monday night: “Israel will for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility [in Gaza] because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t have that security responsibility.”                                                                                          Israel’s military claims to have captured a Hamas military stronghold and detonated a Hamas weapons depot “in a civilian area” adjacent to al-Quds hospital. 
 Israel has repeatedly claimed that Hamas is using hospital buildings to carry out military operations.                                                                                          Israeli forces said they had severed northern Gaza from the rest of the besieged territory and pounded it with intense airstrikes on Monday, setting the stage for an expected push into Gaza City.                                                                                          The UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, began a five-day visit to the Middle East on Tuesday to engage with government officials and civil society on the human rights violations taking place amid Israel’s escalation in Gaza.  “It has been one full month of carnage, of incessant suffering, bloodshed, destruction, outrage and despair,” Türk said in a statement.                                                                                          The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the protection of civilians “must be paramount” in the conflict between Israel and Hamas, warning that the Gaza Strip was becoming “a graveyard for children”.  Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, responded by saying: “Shame on you.”                                                                                          More than half a million people in northern Gaza face death by starvation as food supplies run “perilously” low, an international charity has warned.  Riham Jafari, coordinator of advocacy and communication for ActionAid Palestine, said “Cases of dehydration and malnutrition are increasing rapidly”. UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has described the situation in Gaza as a “tragedy of colossal proportions”.                                                                 The Israel Defence Forces military spokesperson Daniel Hagari has said that on Tuesday Israel has again fired into Lebanon in response to an attack.                                                                 Haaretz reports that a Palestinian woman has been shot this morning in the occupied West Bank after allegedly approaching Israeli forces with a knife and a Hamas flag.                                                                 The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has arrived in Japan for a meeting of Group of Seven foreign ministers expected to be dominated by the Israel-Hamas war.                                                                                           The Kremlin called on Tuesday for “humanitarian pauses” in Israel’s military operation in the Gaza Strip, and it described the humanitarian situation there as “catastrophic”.  Russia will continue contacts with Israel, Egypt and the Palestinians to help ensure that humanitarian supplies can be delivered into Gaza , Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a regular briefing. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has killed nearly 22,000 civilians, according to UN figures.                                                                                          Russia’s foreign ministry said a statement by an Israeli junior minister who appeared to voice openness to the idea of Israel carrying out a nuclear strike on Gaza had raised many questions. Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said “It turns out that we are hearing an official statement about the presence of nuclear weapons? Accordingly, the next questions that everyone has are – where are the international organisations, where is the IAEA, where are the inspectors?”. Israel has never conducted a public nuclear test or stated in public that it has possession of nuclear weapons. However, international observers believe  it has a stockpile of 80-90 warheads.                                                                                          US state department employees have signed a dissent memo arguing that the Biden administration should be willing to publicly criticise the Israeli government, according to a report.  The memo, obtained  by Politico, suggests a growing loss of confidence among in US diplomats in President Joe Biden’s approach to the Middle East crisis, the outlet writes.                                                                                          About 80 dual nationals and 17 medical evacuees had left Gaza to Egypt through the Rafah crossing by early Monday evening, Reuters reported, citing Egyptian security sources, after evacuations were suspended for two days after an ambulance was hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza on Friday.

The US announced it was sending military support to Israel and strengthening its naval and air force presence in the region amid widespread condemnation of the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians , and as the UN warned the region was on a “dangerous precipice”.
Joe Biden told Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday that “additional assistance for the Israel Defence Forces is now on its way to Israel with more to follow over the coming days”, according to a White House account of the conversation. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the military support would include “equipment and resources, including munitions”.
Austin also announced that the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group of warships including guided missile destroyers would be deployed farther east in the Mediterranean while US air force squadrons of fighter planes around the region would be augmented, in what he portrayed as a show of deterrence.
“The US maintains ready forces globally to further reinforce this deterrence posture if required,” the defence secretary said.
There were reported to be many Americans among the victims. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the administration was trying to verify reports of “several Americans” killed in the fighting and others who were missing. The Israeli ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, said there were dozens of Americans among the hostages that Hamas militants had taken back into Gaza.
Two Argentinians and a French citizen were reported dead while two Brazilians, two Mexicans and a British man were said to be missing after the Hamas attack on Saturday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that two Ukrainian nationals had also died in the violence.
Many of the foreign victims had been attending a music festival near the Gaza border that was overrun by Hamas militants.
An emergency session of the UN security council was called in the hope of a rare moment of unity as the violence threatened to spread. The UN Middle East peace envoy, Tor Wennesland, said: “This is a dangerous precipice, and I appeal to all to pull back from the brink.”
While western countries with many African and Latin American countries focused their response on condemning the Hamas attack, Russia, China and Turkey issued general appeals for restraint, as did several Arab states. But some parts of the Islamic world blamed Israel exclusively.
In the Egyptian city of Alexandria, two Israeli tourists and an Egyptian were reported to have been shot dead by a police officer who opened fire on an Israeli tour group  visiting a religious site, in an incident underlining the danger that the conflict could trigger violence beyond the Middle East.
France, Germany, Argentina and the UK were among the countries that said they were taking additional security measures for their Jewish communities.
“We have stepped up security at places of worship and at schools. There is no specific threat at this stage, but we will remain extremely vigilant,” France’s prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, told the BFMTV channel.
Germany’s interior minister, Nancy Faeser, told the Bild newspaper that federal and regional authorities were coordinating security measures and also closely watching “potential supporters of Hamas in the Islamist sphere”.
Berlin police posted photos on social media showing “people celebrating the attacks on Israel by passing out pastries” in Berlin, and said they had carried out identity checks and, in some cases, filed charges.
On Saturday night, the city’s most famous landmark, the Brandenburg Gate, was lit up in the colours of the Israeli flag.
Britain’s home secretary, Suella Braverman, said she had consulted the Community Security Trust , a charity dedicated to the safety of British Jews, “to ensure the government is doing everything necessary for the protection of our Jewish communities”.
Braverman also warned that the police would act against open declarations of support for Hamas.
“There must be zero tolerance for antisemitism or glorification of terrorism on the streets of Britain,” she said. “I expect the police to use the full force of the law against displays of support for Hamas, other proscribed terrorist groups or attempts to intimidate British Jews.”
The Arab and Islamic world was split in its reaction between those countries that declared general calls for restraint from both sides, and those who held Israel solely responsible because of the treatment of Palestinians and the indiscriminate nature of the retaliation on residential buildings in Gaza.
The Saudi foreign ministry called for an “immediate cessation of violence”, as did the United Arab Emirates. Egypt warned of “grave consequences” and called for “exercising maximum restraint and avoiding exposing civilians to further danger”. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, also called for “restraint from all parties.”
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, called for all acts of violence to stop but said the “root of the conflict” was the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
The Qatari foreign ministry called for general restraint but declared Israel alone responsible for the escalation of violence against Palestinians. Kuwait also blamed Israel for its “blatant attacks”.
The most emphatic support for Hamas came from Iran, which has long supported the militant movement.
“Iran supports the legitimate defence of the Palestinian nation,” President Ebrahim Raisi said, according to state television. Raisi praised the “resistance” efforts of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad and declared: “The Zionist regime and its supporters are responsible for endangering the security of nations in the region, and they must be held accountable in this matter.”

Top senator calls on Biden to ‘use all levers’ to pressure Israel over Gaza

Highlight: Democrat Chris Van Hollen says Biden must cease giving arms to Israel until it lifts restrictions on aid and does more to protect lives
Body


Joe Biden should use his leverage and the law to pressure Israel to change how it is prosecuting the war in Gaza, the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen said.
Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, is among a group of senators urging Biden to stop providing Israel with offensive weapons until it lifts restrictions on the delivery of food and medicine into Gaza, where children are now dying of hunger  and famine looms.
“We need the president and the Biden administration to push harder and to use all the levers of US policy to ensure people don’t die of starvation,” Van Hollen said in an interview on Friday.
This week, Van Hollen and seven of his colleagues  sent a letter to the president arguing that Israel was in violation of the Foreign Assistance Act, a section of which prohibits the sale and transfer of military weapons to any nation that restricts the delivery of US aid.
Their call comes as the administration faces mounting domestic and international pressure over what critics have described as an “absurd”  and “ inherent contradiction  ” at the heart of US policy on Israel’s war against Hamas: while the US attempts to ease the deepening humanitarian crisis caused by Israel’s military campaign in the Palestinian territory, it continues to arm the country.
In a sign of the widening rift between Israel and its most important ally, Van Hollen said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, was openly defying Biden’s pleas that Israel do more to protect civilians in Gaza and work toward a long-term solution to the conflict that includes the establishment of a Palestinian state.
“Prime Minister Netanyahu has been an obstacle to the president’s efforts to at least create some light at the end of this very dark tunnel,” Van Hollen said.
In recent weeks, Biden has escalated his criticism of Israel’s military offensive, saying last weekend that Netanyahu was “ hurting  ” his country’s standing by failing to prevent more civilian deaths in Gaza. But the US president has so far resisted Democrats’ calls to leverage future military aid as a means of reining in Israel’s conduct in the war.
The United Nations warned last month that more than a quarter of the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza face “ catastrophic levels of deprivation and starvation  ”. It said without action, widespread famine would be “almost inevitable”. Israel’s military campaign, which came in retaliation for the Hamas attack on 7 October that killed about 1,200 people, has devastated Gaza and killed more than 30,000 people, most of them civilians.
With the prospects of a truce elusive  and far too little aid trickling in, Biden has authorized airdrops  and the construction of a maritime corridor  to deliver desperately needed food and medicine to the Palestinian people living in the besieged territory. But critics say those methods are less effective, less efficient and more dangerous  than the unhindered delivery of supplies by land.
“The very fact that the United States is airlifting humanitarian supplies and is now going to be opening a temporary port is a symptom of the larger problem, which is [that] the Netanyahu government has restricted the amount of aid coming into Gaza and the safe distribution of aid within Gaza,” Van Hollen said.
Israel, which tightened its already strict controls on access to the enclave after 7 October, has denied that it is impeding the flow of aid.
Amid intensifying international pressure, Israel said this week it would expand the amount of supplies into the country. A small convoy of six trucks, coordinated by the Israeli military,  brought humanitarian aid directly  into the isolated northern Gaza earlier this week. Separately, an aid ship  loaded with 200 tons of rice, flour, chicken and other items arrived in Gaza on Friday, in the first test of a new sea route.
But that is a far cry from what is needed, humanitarian workers say. Before the five-month-old conflict began, roughly 500 truckloads of humanitarian aid per day crossed into the territory. Now the number is far less, sometimes peaking above 200 trucks per day but often well below, according to UN figures. 
Van Hollen’s insistence that the US do more to push Israel on humanitarian aid was informed by his visit to the Rafah crossing from Egypt in January, and the onerous Israeli inspection process he witnessed.
“You witnessed these very, very long lines of trucks trying to get in through Rafah and through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and quite an inspection review, including arbitrary denials of humanitarian aid being delivered into Gaza, which just makes the process even more cumbersome,” he said.
“For example, we visited a warehouse in Rafah that was filled with goods that had been rejected at the inspection sites. The rejected goods included things like maternity kits, included things like water purification systems.”
Van Hollen said no specific reason was given as to why the items were rejected, but said Israel has broadly claimed that they could be considered “dual use” or having a civilian or military purpose. The maternity kit, Van Hollen said, contained a “teeny little scalpel” that he speculated was the reason the package was turned back.
Across the border in Gaza, the situation is dire. UN agencies have estimated that 180 women give birth every day , sometimes without access to adequate  pain medication, food or hygiene products. Malnourished, dehydrated and increasingly anemic, many pregnant women in Gaza face elevated risks of postpartum hemorrhaging. 
Another problem, Van Hollen said, is that so many of the people delivering aid or accompanying the aid convoys have been killed, making coordination and distribution of the aid that does enter difficult.
Netanyahu and his government, the senator said, “need to open more crossings, they need to end the arbitrary rejection of goods like maternity kits and solar powered desalinization units, and they need to make sure that food can be safely delivered within Gaza without people getting killed.”
Van Hollen’s comments came the day after Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish elected official in the US and a longtime ally of Israel’s, was unsparing in a speech in which he declared that Netanyahu had “lost his way”, and urged Israelis to hold elections to replace him. Biden, who has been increasingly open about his frustration with Netanyahu, called it a “good speech”.
Van Hollen called Schumer’s speech an “important moment” that made clear the US believes “there needs to be a change in course” in the way Israel is conducting the war.
                   ‘The administration will have to decide’                   
In the letter to Biden earlier this week, Van Hollen and his colleagues wrote: “According to public reporting and your own statements, the Netanyahu government is in violation of [the Foreign Assistance Act]. Given this reality, we urge you to make it clear to the Netanyahu government that failure to immediately and dramatically expand humanitarian access and facilitate safe aid deliveries throughout Gaza will lead to serious consequences, as specified under existing US law.”
Van Hollen also argued that the Israeli government is “not in compliance” with a national security memorandum (NSM 20) issued by the president last month  that requires any country that receives US military assistance to provide written assurances it will “not arbitrarily deny, restrict, or otherwise impede” the delivery of humanitarian aid.
Israel reportedly provided that commitment in a letter to Biden signed by Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant on Thursday, according to Axios.  Van Hollen said the onus is now on the US to assess the credibility of Israel’s assurances.
“Part of that evaluation will depend on what’s happening on the ground right now, and their assessment of whether or not, in fact, the Netanyahu government is meeting that requirement,” he said. “And if the signatures and commitments are found to be lacking, then the administration cannot provide military assistance until they determine that they’re credible.”
Van Hollen stressed that enforcing the statute would not prevent the US from continuing to send defensive military assistance to protect Israeli citizens from rocket attacks, such as the Iron Dome.
The memorandum was issued last month, after Van Hollen and more than a dozen Democratic senators  introduced an amendment to a wartime aid package  that included military assistance for Ukraine, Israel and other US-allies. The senators’ proposal, which would have required any country receiving US weapons to comply with humanitarian laws, risked a messy floor fight among Democrats divided over the US’s approach to the war amid Gaza’s rising death toll.
Instead, Van Hollen said, the administration offered to turn the amendment into a memorandum that, with the force of law, would apply the terms to the sale and transfer of all US military aid. Biden issued the memorandum, and the Senate later approved the foreign aid package, with Van Hollen’s support. That measure is now languishing in the House.
Biden has warned that Israel would cross a “red line” if it proceeded with a large-scale invasion of the southern city of Rafah, where the war has pushed nearly half of Gaza’s population.  Reports suggest  Netanyahu has approved a plan to invade the city, setting him up for direct conflict with the US president.
Biden has not made clear what consequences Netanyahu might face if he ignores the US’s position. An invasion of Rafah, Van Hollen said, would present “one of those moments where the Biden administration is going to have to decide whether it’s going to back up the president’s strong words with the leverage that it has”.

Highlight: In some of the strongest criticism of Israel’s conduct in its war with Hamas, Antony Blinken says Israel must put a ‘premium on civilian protection’Israel-Hamas war latest updates
Body


The US has issued some of its strongest criticism of Israel’s conduct in the war against Hamas, as growing pressure to speed up the delivery of humanitarian supplies into Gaza has resulted in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu saying that another crossing would be opened into the territory.
US secretary of state Antony Blinken said there was a gap between the Israeli government’s declared intentions to protect civilians and the mounting casualties seen on the ground.
“As we stand here almost a week into this campaign into the south … it remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection,” Blinken said at a press conference after a meeting with British foreign secretary David Cameron in Washington.
“And there does remain a gap between... the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground,” Blinken said.
More than 17,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, since 7 October when Israel began bombarding the territory in response to a cross-border rampage by Hamas militants who control the enclave.
Israel says it intends to wipe out Hamas but is doing everything possible to get civilians out of harm’s way, including warnings about military operations.
In a phone call with Netanyahu on Thursday, US president Joe Biden “emphasised the critical need to protect civilians and to separate the civilian population from Hamas”, the White House said in a statement.
Despite the warnings, hundreds more Palestinians were killed on Thursday according to the Hamas health ministry, and Israel pressed on with its offensive in and around Gaza’s main cities.
Early Friday, the health ministry reported another 40 dead in strikes near Gaza City, and “dozens” more in Jabalia and Khan Yunis.
Israel’s military has continued its heavy bombardment amid intense fighting in Gaza as its war with Hamas hit the two-month mark and the resulting humanitarian crisis threatened a breakdown of public order.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they had struck about 250 targets in Gaza  over a 24-hour period, ending on Thursday morning.
About 1.87 million people in Gaza – more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million – have fled their homes in the past two months, according to the UN. Many families have been displaced multiple times, and are living in tents and overcrowded makeshift shelters.
The mass civilian casualties in the conflict have sparked global concern, heightened by dire shortages caused by an Israeli siege that has seen only limited access for food, water, fuel and medicines in Gaza.
On Thursday, Israel agreed at the request of the United States to open the Kerem Shalom border crossing in southern Gaza for the screening and inspection of trucks and their cargo, for the first time since the outbreak of the war.
If that were to happen, UN aid chief Martin Griffith said it would represent a major boost for humanitarian operations. “It would be the first miracle we’ve seen for some weeks, but would also be a huge boost to the logistical process and logistical base of a humanitarian operation,” he said.
Egypt, along with the United Nations, has been lobbying Israel to speed up an inspection process, which requires the vehicles to drive to Egypt’s border with Israel before looping back to Rafah. The number of trucks crossing daily has dropped to fewer than 100, from nearly 200 during the short-lived truce, according to the United Nations.
Col Elad Goren, from Israel’s Cogat military liaison to the Palestinians, did not give a date for the opening of the crossing, and said the crossing point would be used to increase the capacity to inspect aid trucks, but not to allow aid into Gaza directly.
The White House said that Biden called for more assistance for civilians in Gaza in his call with Netanyahu on Thursday.
The US president added that “much more assistance was urgently required across the board”.
On Friday, the UN Security Council will meet to vote on urging an immediate ceasefire.

Highlight: While the US flounders in a conflict it did not foresee, emerging powers see a chance for new voices to join the top table
Body


Not long ago a picture circulated from inside Gaza showing smoke billowing from the explosion of a US-supplied bomb, and discernible in the background was the outline of eight black parachutes dropping US aid in precisely the same neighbourhood. It was suggested that the picture would make an ideal cover for any book about the confused world disorder that the six-month war in Gaza have spawned – a disorder that as yet has no dominant player, value system or functioning institutions.
The great powers compete, coexist or confront one another across the region but none, least of all at the UN, is able to impose its version of order any longer. “Forget talk of unipolarity or multipolarity,” the journalist Gregg Carlstrom recently wrote in Foreign Affairs. “The Middle East is nonpolar. No one is in charge.”
Wars are supposed to be the father of all things, according to Heraclitus, and many still predict that this war will define everything in the future and prove a turning point to their advantage. Iran believes the US is closer to being forced out of Iraq than at any point in the last two decades and its president, Ebrahim Raisi, has said the war in Gaza will lead to a “transformation in the unjust order that rules the world”. Iran’s ally, the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, whose group has traded fire with Israel across the Lebanese border, has claimed “the onset of a new historical phase” for the entire Middle East and that Israel will be unable to withstand the “al-Aqsa flood”.
By contrast, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, vowed on 9 October, two days after the Hamas massacre in Israel that triggered the war, that the region would be changed to Israel’s benefit. “What we will do to our enemies in the coming days will reverberate with them for generations,” he said.
Six months on, no one believes they have yet lost. And amid these conflicting assessments, China and Russia are not quite bystanders but do not lift a finger to ease US discomfort. Ever an opportunist, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, blamed American handling of relations between Israel and the Palestinians for the mess. “It was Washington’s policy of monopolising mediation and undermining the international legal framework for a settlement that resulted in the current escalation,” he said.
US support for Israel in the Gaza war was also seized upon as a golden chance for Russia’s rehabilitation after Ukraine. In language designed to appeal to the global south, Lavrov denounced America’s “incredible duplicity and double standards”.
Among emerging powers, the lesson of Gaza has been that it is time for new voices to join the top table. “This war is hideous but speaks to a bigger problem: the lack of reform of global governance institutions, including and primarily the UN security council,” said Filipe Nasser, a senior adviser at the Brazilian foreign ministry. “This is the point of convergence across the global south. They feel the international order is profoundly asymmetric and detrimental to their interests. The three US vetoes show how the rules are bent.”
The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has spoken of a similar crisis. “The current international system, devoid of fundamental concepts such as solidarity, justice and trust, cannot fulfil even its minimum responsibilities,” he said. South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, has described Gaza as the last manifestation of the conflict against colonialism and imperialism, and went to the international court of justice to prove her point.
Among western-based intellectuals, there is a sense that something deep is afoot. “The disaster in Gaza has completely disabused a large segment of liberals and professionals in the Arab world about western claims of upholding and caring about values in the conduct of foreign policy,” said Emile Hokayem, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “They look at the western debacle over Gaza and feel betrayed – or, for those who were always cynical about the west, vindicated. For example, some who sympathised with Ukraine have now switched their position. Senior western officials and diplomats are mostly clueless about this dynamic.”
Bronwen Maddox, the director of the UK-based thinktank Chatham House, has warned of wide repercussions. “The charge is the west writes the rules to suit itself. If countries which support Ukraine and are working for peace in the Middle East do not realise how powerful this charge has become, they will fail to help solve either conflict.”
Faced by this barrage, US diplomacy has not enjoyed its finest hour, as every day it seems its inability to control events becomes more apparent. It is locked in a war it had not foreseen, in a region it was seeking to leave behind, in defence of an ally that refuses to do as it asks.
The longer the conflict has continued – and few foresaw six months of it – the more US diplomacy has struggled to withstand the conflicting pressures. Netanyahu, wanting to win more time to “finish the job”, has shown himself unwilling to listen to Joe Biden, while the Gulf Cooperation Council, regardless of its private views of Hamas, has demanded that the US makes a decisive break with Israel and recognises Palestine as a state. The foreign affairs chief of the EU, where the US has many allies, has meanwhile claimed Israel has weaponised hunger, and even the UK has been moved to show some independence from Washington.
Through its Houthi allies attacking shipping in the Red Sea, Iran has revealed itself as a supple player and claimed strategic influence over three major economic choke points: the Suez canal at the north of the Red Sea, the Bab el-Mandeb strait at its south and the strait of Hormuz at the entrance to the Gulf.
US diplomacy has suffered defeat after defeat. On 27 October, 121 states at the general assembly backed an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, with 14 voting against and 44 abstaining. By 12 December, support for an unconditional ceasefire had hardened, with 153 in favour, only 10 against and 23 abstentions. Apart from the US, the total population of the countries in the US column was a paltry 68 million – hardly the kind of support the “indispensable power” should have at its disposal.
On 18 December the US was able to announce the names of only 10 countries willing to join Operation Prosperity Guardian , the naval alliance to protect freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Apart from Bahrain, the home of the US fifth fleet, not a single Arab state joined the US alliance. 
When Biden assumed the US presidency he recruited a team of prodigious foreign policy talent, perhaps the most venerated ensemble of such experts in modern US history. They were given a clear mission: to rebuild US alliances, repair America’s damaged reputation abroad and prepare for the challenge in the South China Sea.
The Palestinian issue had not been a White House priority but at best something to be managed. The March 2023 US National Risk Assessment made no mention of the Palestinian issue. Meanwhile, spokespeople, when asked, paid lip service to a two-state solution and issued pro forma condemnations of Israeli settlements. To the extent that Biden had a distinctive contribution to make, it lay in the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor initiative, an economic artery designed to rival China’s belt and road scheme.
But Biden is confident in his foreign policy expertise and his initial advice to Israel – not to make the same mistakes that the US did in its own “war on terror” – appeared subtle, well pitched and true to himself. A decades-long Zionist and supporter of Israel in Washington, he advised: “While you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it.” The policy was to hug Netanyahu and the hostage families close.
Biden misread how Israeli society had changed over the last two decades, and consequently how best to influence Netanyahu’s response to the Hamas attacks. He did not foresee what Netanyahu’s war cabinet was prepared to do to expunge a trauma that required not just revenge but an irreversible and ill-defined change in the relationship with Palestinians, so that Israel’s security issue could be assured once and for all. Biden “lives with an Israel in his head which probably never existed and certainly doesn’t exist today,” said Daniel Levy, a former Israeli negotiator in peace talks with Palestinian leaders. Israel says it is acting in self-defence.
At the same time, Biden should have had no illusions about the complexion of the Israeli government, a rightwing coalition including religious nationalists. In June 2023 he admitted it included “some of the most extreme members” he had ever seen, who had been given unprecedented power and legitimacy by Netanyahu so that they could govern alongside his Likud party.
Biden knew too that Netanyahu had been a polarising figure in US politics ever since he was appointed Israeli ambassador to the UN at the age of 35 in 1984. Famously, after meeting Netanyahu for the first time, Bill Clinton told his staff: “Who’s the fucking superpower here?” In 2015, Netanyahu came to Washington to urge a Republican-led Congress to reject Barack Obama’s policy on Iran. Even Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and a Bibi admirer, said Netanyahu was always “on the game”.
But it took the Biden White House an inordinately long time to accept that Israel and US interests in Gaza were fundamentally not aligning. American demands were, from its perspective, simple. It endorsed the elimination of Hamas as a political and military force, but it wanted this done surgically, something the Israeli military said was impossible. It also wanted a clear understanding that Israel’s future security came through nurturing a Palestinian partner for peace, and that required a detailed plan, something Netanyahu avoided, fearing it would split his coalition.
For all the times that Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said on his many tours of the region that the way Israel conducted operations mattered, events in Gaza appeared to confirm that Israel felt less constrained by world opinion than the US.
Briefings about Biden’s growing impatience with Netanyahu, and the candid private conversations the two men held, started appearing in the US press as early as November. The more the stories appeared and the less any real-world consequence was imposed on Israel, the more Biden appeared weak or deceitful – neither a good look in an election year.
November’s election has loomed ever larger the longer the war has lasted, so much so that it was not just Netanyahu who began to see the war through the prism of his own political survival. Biden looked at the never-ending war, the electoral clock ticking, and at the polls. The Obama-era strategist David Axelrod said: “The subtext of the whole Republican campaign is the world is out of control and Biden is not in command. That is the basic Republican argument. Age is a surrogate for weakness and it is not helpful if Bibi is seen to be punking him.” Inside the White House, Axelrod said, “there are people whose map of the world is six states, and they want the war to stop”.
“Genocide Joe” may not be the single biggest reason Biden’s overall job approval rating is stuck at an alarmingly low 40%, but for a whole generation coming of political age, the deaths in Palestine and “America’s complicity” is the great moral issue of their time.
For Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to the US senator Bernie Sanders, the debate over Gaza had “morphed into a proxy for a larger debate about America’s role in the world, and about the future of the Democratic party. A younger generation are done with engaging with the world primarily through the use and supply of deadly weapons. They are tired of their government upholding a blatant double standard on human rights and then gaslighting them about that double standard.”
Increasingly, Netanyahu personally attracted the blame. William Hague, the former British foreign secretary, was one of the first in the political establishment on this side of the Atlantic to openly express such an opinion, reflecting a strong private Foreign Office view that Hamas could not be defeated militarily. A high-profile visit to Washington and London by the Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, Netanyahu’s chief political rival, was then seen as an unsubtle rebuke to the Israeli prime minister’s refusal to countenance a future relationship with a revamped Palestinian Authority.
The dam burst when Chuck Schumer, the majority leader in the US Senate, described the Israeli leader as a major impediment to peace in the Middle East and called for elections to replace him when the war ended. He said his main purpose in writing a speech that took nearly two months of drafting “was to say you can still love Israel and feel strongly about Israel and totally disagree with Bibi Netanyahu and the policies of Israel”.
It reflected a deeper change in US Democratic party thinking with which Biden struggles. “Much of what Schumer said would have been unthinkably radical on the floor of the Senate 10 years ago. Today it represents the rightward edge of the party,” Duss said. As the six-month anniversary drew near, even Trump, who in office had moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, said America’s natural support for Israel had evaporated.
It is telling that it took the deaths of six western aid workers for Biden finally this week to wield the power that he has had at his disposal all along, and tell Netanyahu that he had to reverse out of the diplomatic cul de sac he had taken his country or else lose the American support on which his survival depended. There was – as there should have been throughout – only one superpower in this relationship.
Israel feels aggrieved at its loss of public support and feels the world has forgotten the need to crush hostage-taking and terrorism. Eylon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson, complained of international organisations and agencies that he said had “simply been hijacked” by the Palestinian agenda. “The WHO cannot bring itself to condemn Hamas militarisation of hospitals. The Red Cross cannot bring itself to condemn Hamas hijacking aid trucks and Unrwa actively covers up Hamas theft of aid,” he said.
Most Israelis dislike Netanyahu but not the tactics to crush Hamas. “We are in the trauma. We are not post-trauma. We still live in 7 October,” said Michael Sfard, an Israeli human rights lawyer. “In Israeli media there is nothing about Gaza save embedded journalism or drones. Since 7 October there has not been a single interview from Gaza. It is not state censorship, it is self-censorship. We are fed by television channels and newspapers that censor and block information from us, both about events in Gaza and about our way of fighting there.”
He added: “The horror we inflicted on Gaza cannot be justified by the horrors of Hamas. The numbers of children we killed and the extent of the destruction does not add up to any explanation other than revenge.”
Six months on, the outcome is unclear. Hamas may yet be crushed and a normalisation in relations between Saudi and Israel secured. US-sanctioned raw power may have remade the Middle East.
But equally, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, hopes, this could yet be a turning point – a moment to learn lessons of a collective failure by re-establishing a true rule of law, stronger multilateral institutions and clearer power relations. Deadlocked in Gaza, everything is in the balance.

Highlight: President is facing pressure from Republicans after numerous attacks on US bases by Iran’s proxies
Body


The killing of three American soldiers in Jordan and the wounding of dozens more, allegedly by an Iranian-backed group, is a red line that was always likely to be crossed in what is becoming an increasingly dangerous region.
The US had up to this weekend avoided fatalities in more than 150 attacks on its military bases by Iranian proxies since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war after the 7 October attacks, but that luck could not last for ever. The question now is what lies on the far side of that red line.
It is a scenario that has repeatedly been discussed in the Pentagon and the national security council, but decisions in reality depend on the array of circumstances at the time. Biden will now choose from a menu of options and consider the dilemma of how far to go to restore deterrence, while balancing the desire to end the open season on US positions across the Middle East with the avoidance of a head-on American-Iranian war.
A former US commander in the region said the options presented to the president would include “targets in Iran that are linked to production of munitions, for training and equipping Iran’s surrogate forces”.
There has been a chorus of demands from Republican senators and some former US generals since the attack on the Tower 22 base on the Jordan-Syria border for Biden to cut out the middle men and bomb Iran directly.
 Related:  Jordan drone strike: who are Islamic Resistance in Iraq and what is Tower 22?
Wesley Clark, a retired general who was once Nato’s supreme commander in Europe, wrote on X  : “The US should stop saying, ‘We don’t want to escalate.’ This invites them to attack us. Stop calling our strikes ‘retaliation’. This is reactive. Take out their capabilities and strike hard at the source: Iran.”
Biden will now be sensitive to accusations of weakness on the world stage as his fight for re-election – almost certainly against Donald Trump – begins in earnest. But airstrikes in Iran would be a huge step. There may well have been US covert military operations in Iran since the Islamic revolution of 1979, but never an overt strike. Trump came the closest, ordering strikes on Iran with missiles and warplanes in June 2019 in retaliation for the downing of a US drone, but he rescinded the launch order with 10 minutes to go. He said he changed his mind  because of the estimated civilian casualties and the consequent risk of an all out US-Iran war.
The same concerns now weigh heavily on Biden. The region is already a battlefield, with a US-led coalition exchanging fire with Tehran-backed Houthis in Yemen, and the threat of an Israeli-Hezbollah war in Lebanon. Any escalation in the Gulf will trigger a spike in oil prices and global inflation that would be far more damaging to the president’s re-election prospects than some name-calling from old soldiers and Republican senators.
Nicholas Heras, senior director for the strategy and innovation at the New Lines Institute in Washington, said: “The Biden administration is locked into a difficult position because senior members of the administration want to continue to pivot to competing with China in Asia and confronting Russia in Europe while not seeming to be backing down to Iran in the Middle East.”
That balance has become increasingly hard to maintain, Heras added. “The situation in the region is metastasising rapidly toward a face-off between the United States and Iran, which has been years in the making,” he said.
The principal restraining factor is the fact that neither capital believes it is in its interests to turn a succession of proxy conflicts into an all-out war.
Dina Esfandiary, a senior adviser for the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, said: “Iran can’t afford to have a multi-front war. From conversations with some officials, I firmly believe that it’s something they’re really quite frightened of, because it’s unprecedented. I’m not sure they know how to manage a full-blown conflict with the US.”
However, it remains Iranian strategy to raise the stakes of US presence in the region, arming and giving increasing free rein to its proxy militias, until Washington begins to pull out its troops. Retaliatory strikes by the US against those militias in recent months have proved an insufficient deterrent, so the pressure will be on Biden to step up the response.
One option would be to target Iranians and Iranian hardware outside Iran’s borders. At the high end of that variant would be an attack on Iranian warships supporting the Houthis in the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden. Lower down the scale would be strikes on Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) bases inside Syria, including a facility known as the Glasshouse at Damascus airport, which Charles Lister, of the Middle East Institute thinktank, called the “IRGC’s most sensitive command/control facility in Syria”.
The former US commander said it was also possible that facilities of the IRGC’s expeditionary Quds force in Iraq could also be hit, but that runs the risk of further complicating an already fractious relationship with the government in Baghdad that is threatening to evict US forces in the country.
“I think it’s a particularly fraught situation with fragility in a number of these different areas,” they said. “Responding obviously is absolutely necessary, if it really does degrade the capacity and capability of these forces shooting at our bases and our soldiers. But how to do that without inflaming an already very challenging situation? I think it is very difficult.”

Good morning. It’s been another remorseless weekend for the people of Gaza.  On Saturday night, an Israeli air strike at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp killed at least 45 people, the Hamas-run health ministry claimed, while the head of the Al-Aqsa hospital put the toll at 52; Israel says it is investigating the incident. And late on Sunday, a series of huge explosions lit up the sky over the territory – strikes which Israeli media reports suggested were a precursor to an advance on Gaza City within the next 48 hours.
About 120 miles north, exchanges across Israel’s border with Lebanon continued at a much lower intensity – but with a momentum of their own. Lebanese state media said that three children and their grandmother were killed in an Israeli air strike, an incident that prompted retaliatory rocket strikes on the northern Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona. Those ongoing border skirmishes have fuelled fears of a new front involving a far more powerful regional actor than Hamas: Hezbollah.
Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, gave a speech on Friday  which seemed to fall short of a threat of imminent escalation – but incidents like yesterday’s suggest how events could spin out of control. If that were to happen, it would come with a risk of a wider conflict drawing in Iran and the United States. For today’s newsletter, I spoke with the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont, who has been reporting from the border, about what to take from Nasrallah’s speech, and the risks of a new front in the war opening up – even if nobody wants it to.
PS: Your eagle eyes will have noticed a change in your inbox today: I’m back after parental leave, considerably more expert in nappies and night feeds than when I last wrote to you. Huge thanks to Nimo and the indefatigable roster of writers who picked up the slack while I was gone. Here are the headlines.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            King’s speech  | Rishi Sunak will this week announce legislation for a new annual system for awarding oil and gas licences  as part of a highly political king’s speech which the Conservatives hope will open up clear dividing lines with Labour. The government, which has already watered down the UK’s climate targets, said the plans would protect jobs and bolster energy security.
                                            Poverty  | Poverty levels in the UK are “simply not acceptable” and the government is violating international law, the United Nations’ poverty envoy has said ahead of a visit to the country this week.  Olivier De Schutter told the Guardian that “things have got worse” since his predecessor Philip Alston angered the government with criticism on his own visit in 2019.
                                            Ukraine  | Volodymyr Zelenskiy has denied a claim from the Ukrainian military’s commander-in-chief that the war with Russia has reached a stalemate.  Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi said the war had entered an attritional phase and suggested Russia was slowly gaining the upper hand.
                                            Conservatives  | Oliver Dowden, the deputy prime minister, has denied that rape allegations against a Conservative MP were “covered up”  during his time running the party’s headquarters. It follows reports in the Mail on Sunday that allegations against an MP were not dealt with properly by the party, allowing the politician to continue offending.
                                            Israel-Hamas war  | The parents-in-law of Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, have arrived safely in Scotland after fleeing the conflict in Gaza.  Yousaf shared a family photo of his wife, Nadia, and her parents, Elizabeth and Maged El-Nakla, who were among 92 British nationals permitted to pass through the Rafah border crossing into Egypt on Friday morning.
                   In depth: The role Hezbollah could play in escalating conflict in the Middle East                   
Hezbollah – which means “party of God” – was founded by a group of radical Shia clerics in 1982, with Iranian backing from the beginning, and is designated as a terrorist group by the US, UK and Israel, among others. It is devoted to the expulsion of western powers from the Middle East, and rejects Israel’s right to exist. In this explainer , Jason Burke notes that it is viewed as a pioneer of mass casualty suicide attacks. But it is also a key player in Lebanon’s government, and controls many Shia-majority areas of the country, particularly in the south, near the Israeli border.
Analysts point to Iran’s influence over Hezbollah as a key determinant of its strategy in all of its actions against Israel: like Hamas, Hezbollah is trained, funded and supplied by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Lina Khatib, director of the Soas Middle East Institute, writes  : “Neither Hamas nor Hezbollah take decisions to declare war or peace without explicit prior agreement from Iran.”
Nonetheless, analysts note that Hamas and Hezbollah do not have identical agendas: indeed, they were profoundly split during the Syrian civil war, when Hamas backed the rebels while Hezbollah sided with Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah is a far better equipped force than Hamas, with loftier regional ambitions. And partly because Iran and Hezbollah both adhere to Shia Islam – unlike Hamas, which is Sunni – they are much more closely aligned.
“The fact is that regardless of what happened on 7 October and what’s happened since in the south, the biggest perceived threat to Israel is from Hezbollah,” Peter Beaumont said. “You have to ask yourself: if Israel says it can’t live with the threat of Hamas, what does that suggest about future security questions about Hezbollah? I don’t know what the answer is, but the question is clearly being asked.”
***
                     How has Hezbollah reacted since 7 October?                   
Ever since Hamas attacked southern Israel, there have been intensified cross-border exchanges in the north of the country that have fallen short of a cause for escalation. An increase in rocket attacks has led to the evacuation  of Israeli civilians living very close to the Lebanese border, and the internal displacement of more than 25,000 people  in Lebanon, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Before yesterday’s exchanges, Israel said that six of its soldiers have been killed, as well as one civilian, while Hezbollah has announced the deaths of 61 of its fighters. 
But both sides have so far stuck to the “undeclared rules of engagement whereby neither side sparks a new war”, Khatib wrote. Hezbollah has hit military posts and targets that it views as Lebanese territory under Israeli occupation, while Israel has bombed Hezbollah-connected targets within 3km of the border.
Nonetheless, the range of attacks has crept upwards in the weeks since 7 October, and with that comes fear of a chain of events that could lead to an all-out conflict. With Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah conspicuously silent since the original Hamas attack until Friday, there have been fears his organisation could be biding its time, and preparing to respond once an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza is fully under way.
***
                     What did Nasrallah say on Friday?                   
When Nasrallah finally broke his silence with a speech shown on large screens across Lebanon on Friday , he praised the 7 October attack estimated to have killed more than 1,400 Israelis and taken hundreds as hostages as “a greatly successful” operation that had exposed “the frailty, weakness and total fragility of Israel  … it’s more fragile than a spider’s web”. He also suggested that Hezbollah retained the option of expanding its cross-border attacks “at any time”. But he stopped short of any declaration of war – and emphasised that the Hamas attack had been carried out without Hezbollah’s knowledge.
Peter is cautious of any interpretation that treats Nasrallah’s speech as a cause for relief. “Understanding the messaging is not straightforward,” he said. “I think it’s still an open question what Hezbollah will do. As they play this game of incremental escalation, all it would take is a strike that kills X number – and we don’t know what that number is – for the logic of the situation to no longer be under control. And as Nasrallah does this very careful tightrope walk, that doesn’t mean that other people in the organisation wouldn’t prefer to be more proactive.”
***
                     Could there be an escalation on the Israel-Lebanon border?                   
Nasrallah certainly wants the world to fear the prospect – and on Saturday, Hezbollah fired a powerful missile of a type not used since 7 October. The reported deaths of three children and their grandmother in an Israeli attack, and Hezbollah’s retaliation, might also be seen as the kind of event that could have a domino effect – though there has been no sharp escalation in response as yet, with the frontier town of Kiryat Shmona that was hit in response now largely deserted. (Peter and Quique Kierszenbaum sent this vivid dispatch  from the area last week.)
There is no doubt that Hezbollah has the firepower to considerably expand its operations: it is estimated to have an arsenal of about 150,000 missiles and rockets, and while most of those are “dumb” weapons with a range of a few dozen kilometres, some are precision guided, with the ability to reach far into the Israeli interior. “If something serious is fired at a population centre like Haifa, all bets would be off,” Peter said.
There are factors weighing against such an escalation. Hezbollah is unpopular in Lebanon outside its Shia power base  because of a perception that it is prepared to unilaterally drag the country into war, and Israel has warned that it would not distinguish between Hezbollah territory and the rest of the country in any response. Israel says that it has plenty of forces held in reserve for any confrontation with Hezbollah. The arrival of two US carrier groups in the Mediterranean  is a further reason for Hezbollah to fear the consequences of a larger conflict.
Despite all that, events of the last month have injected a new kind of uncertainty into Israel’s security calculations. “It would be naive, after 7 October, to trust that what’s happening in the north is nasty but under control,” Peter said. “Everyone missed the buildup to Hamas’s attack. It would be terribly complacent to assume this is going to stay as it is at the moment.”
***
                     Would any escalation lead to a wider war?                   
Much of the diplomatic effort in the aftermath of the 7 October attack has been driven by fears that – even if none of the players are immediately seeking such an outcome – a war between Hezbollah and Israel could escalate rapidly. The US would probably feel bound to support Israel if that happened, fearing that the deterrent value of its forces in the region would be lost if it turns out to be bluffing. Iran, too, says that it does not want a wider war and insists it does not control Hezbollah, but has warned that “the probable spread of war in other fronts is approaching an unavoidable stage”.
Iran’s leverage over Hezbollah, the US deterrent, Israel’s strategic desire to focus on Gaza, and Hezbollah’s fears for its own destruction all might be seen as mitigating against a new front opening up, at least for now. But if Hezbollah or Israel feel that a red line is crossed by the other side, that doesn’t mean it might not happen anyway.

Sidelined over Gaza war, Mahmoud Abbas faces growing calls to quit

Highlight: Departure of longtime leader would pave way for new elections and much needed reform of Palestinian Authority
Body


Last month the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, flew to the Qatari capital, Doha, for talks on securing a ceasefire in the war in Gaza. That in itself was unusual; the West Bank-based Abbas, who is also chair of the Fatah party and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), has been all but sidelined by local and international actors since the conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out.
According to three sources with knowledge of the meetings, which involved Palestinian and Qatari officials as well as diplomats from around the region, it was suggested that Abbas, 88, should consider shifting to a ceremonial presidential role. Such a move would pave a path for new Palestinian elections and help heal the long-running rift between Fatah and Hamas. It would also allow US-led hopes for a “revitalised”, “single structure” Palestinian Authority (PA) that could take charge in Gaza to move forward, with the eventual aim of restarting peace talks aimed at a two-state solution.
Abbas, whose four-year term expired in 2009, declined to consider the proposal, two Palestinian and one western diplomatic source said, in effect shutting the door on desperately needed reform within the corrupt and undemocratic  PA. Abbas’s office and the Qatari foreign ministry did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.
“We can’t move forward with Abu Mazen calling the shots,” said Nour Oudeh, a Palestinian political analyst, using Abbas’s well-known kunya. “There needs to be buy-in across the Palestinian public and political spectrum. The [PA] is weak and has made itself irrelevant. We can’t just put some makeup on it and make it look pretty … We are too far gone in Gaza for that now.”
In the five months since Hamas attacked Israel, sparking the worst war in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, much has been made of how Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, appears to be slow-walking ceasefire talks.
Facing multiple corruption trials, Netanyahu seems to believe he stands a better chance of beating the charges if he remains in office, and elections are unlikely while Israel is at war. Until 7 October, his efforts to sideline the peace process with the Palestinians were largely successful.
But Abbas, too, stands in the way of meaningful progress towards a two-state solution. A year after he entered office in 2005, his secular Fatah party lost parliamentary elections to the Islamist Hamas, leading to a brief civil war in which the PA lost control of Gaza.
There have been no elections in the occupied Palestinian territories since. In 2021, after polling showed he would lose, Abbas cancelled scheduled elections, a decision that helped to spark that year’s war in Gaza.
Today, most Palestinians regard the PA as little more than a subcontractor for Israeli security, working hand in hand with the occupation to oppress its own people.  In an opinion poll by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research in December, 90% of respondents said Abbas should resign and 60% called for the PA to be totally dismantled.
Mustafa Barghouti, the general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative party, which bills itself as a “third way” between Fatah and Hamas, said: “I have worked on unity initiatives with Hamas for years and I am certain that if we had had elections in 2021, 7 October and this war could have been avoided.”
Recently there have been some indications of openness to change from the West Bank’s political establishment, although critics note it means little as long as Abbas remains in office. Last week his cabinet and the prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, resigned. In a televised statement, Shtayyeh said the “next phase” required “a new government and political arrangements that take into account the new reality in the Gaza Strip, national unity and the urgent need for achieving inter-Palestinian consensus”.
Over the weekend, delegations from Hamas and Fatah held talks in Moscow aimed at forming a new technocratic government to serve until elections can be held, and bringing Hamas under the umbrella of the PLO. While unity talks are held about once a year, there has never been so much at stake. Any new administration in Gaza must have the tacit approval of Hamas to function.
Many stumbling blocks remain. Israel and the west regard Hamas as an untouchable political operator, but Palestinian analysts say attempts at reunifying the West Bank and Gaza will have to involve the Islamist movement.
The PLO recognised the state of Israel in 1993, a development that led to the creation of the PA, which was supposed to be an interim government before the creation of a fully independent Palestinian state. An acknowledgement from Hamas that it respects the PLO’s position on Israel would go a long way towards making the Islamist group more palatable for outside actors.
“It is counterproductive to think that Hamas will not survive, or not continue to be an important player after the war,” Oudeh said. “I am not saying it can be turned into something it is not, or that it should be part of any government, but that voice has to be part of the conversation going forward. Hamas’s political wing is more pragmatic than it is given credit for … They begged the outside world to engage with it for years.”
A former member of a western secret service who was stationed in the region echoed Oudeh’s point. “We always assessed that Hamas would need to be brought in from the cold at some point,” they said. “Since 7 October, that has become a difficult sell.”
Even if the new war had not erupted, time to rejuvenate the PA was already running out. Abbas is in ill health and has never appointed an official successor. Instead, it is widely expected that the president’s ally Hussein al-Sheikh, appointed secretary general of the PA’s executive committee in 2022, or economic adviser Mohammed Mustafa, would take over.
Abbas’s bitter rival Marwan Barghouti , serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison, enjoys the most public support by far, and Mohammed Dahlan, another enemy living in self-imposed exile in Abu Dhabi, is believed to have maintained links to armed groups in the West Bank and Gaza.
Power struggles within Fatah could exacerbate the violence already engulfing the Palestinian territories; in the event of a major power vacuum, Hamas would be all but certain to step into the void.
Palestinian political reform is not in some Israelis’ interests. Over the last 20 or so years, Netanyahu has preferred to keep the Palestinian leadership weak and divided between the two geographically separate areas. He has repeatedly said since the war broke out that Israel would not accept the return of the PA to rule in both Gaza and the West Bank, despite Washington’s wishes.
“The west keeps talking about ‘revitalising’ the PA so that it has legitimacy. There’s no such thing. We need to start again completely … because we are back to 1948,” said Barghouti, referring to the creation of the state of Israel. “This isn’t about revitalising the system. It’s about rebirth.”

The Australian foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has acknowledged “there are increasingly few safe places” for civilians in Gaza and has joined the US in warning that Israel risks “strategic defeat”.
Wong conceded on Thursday that her language about the conflict did not go “ as far as some might want  ” but said this “does not diminish our concern for the numbers of civilian casualties that we are seeing”.
On the final parliamentary sitting day of the year, Wong also described the end of the weeklong “pause” in hostilities as a “grave setback”.
The assistant minister for foreign affairs, Tim Watts, said he would “travel to Qatar, Egypt, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories” this week to try to prevent the conflict from spreading and to push for “a just and enduring peace”.

Israel is facing increasing international scrutiny over its military response  to Hamas’s 7 October attacks on southern Israel, with the UN’s top aid official warning this week of “apocalyptic” conditions in Gaza  and an end to any possibility of meaningful humanitarian operations. Israel argues its actions comply with international law and has told the Australian government it is doing “its utmost to mitigate the civilian casualties”.
The UN humanitarian agency has estimated 1.8 million people – more than three-quarters of Gaza’s population – are now internally displaced, while human rights groups say nowhere in the besieged strip is safe. 
Wong said on Thursday that civilians who fled northern Gaza were “now being pushed further south and as the conflict spreads south there are increasingly few safe places to go”.
She highlighted comments by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, who had said “you can only win in urban warfare by protecting civilians”.
Wong said Austin was “an expert in urban warfare against terrorists from experience fighting Isis and, like us, is a steadfast friend of Israel”.
“This week he shared this wisdom,” Wong told the Senate. “He said if you drive the civilian population into the arms of the enemy, you replace a tactical victory with a strategic defeat.”
Wong said Australia supported five principles outlined by the Biden administration, including “no forcible displacement of Palestinians or reduction in territory”. She also said Hamas had “no place in the future of Gaza”.
She said the Australian government unequivocally condemned Hamas’s attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, while urging Israel respect international humanitarian law in its response. The minister renewed calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining hostages.
The Greens senator Janet Rice said it was “estimated that over 70% of the more than 16,000 people killed in Gaza have been women, children and the elderly”, in a reference to figures issued by authorities in the Hamas-run territory.
Rice challenged Wong to explain why Australia had yet to “join the call of the UN and aid organisations for an immediate and permanent humanitarian ceasefire”.
Wong said “the number of civilian deaths including children has been harrowing and it cannot continue” and Australia was seeking a resumption of the “pause”.
The Labor minister said for a ceasefire to be sustainable it “cannot be one-sided”.
Earlier, the Labor MP and co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine, Maria Vamvakinou, said it was “to the shame of this parliament that we have not, at the very least, given equal weight to the dead children and women of Gaza”.
“What we are witnessing is Israel’s breach of international humanitarian law, the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, and the renewed expulsion of the Palestinian people from their ancestral homelands,” Vamvakinou told parliament.
The Israeli government has defended its military operations in Gaza, saying it “will continue to act according to international law” and that its issuing of evacuation orders reflects attempts to protect civilians.
The Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, said he could  “assure the Australian government that Israel is doing its utmost to mitigate the civilian casualties” but Hamas was using the civilian population as a “human shield”.
He said displacement of civilians from their homes was “temporary”.

Highlight: Josep Borrell says ‘one horror does not justify another’ and calls for unconditional release of hostagesIsrael-Hamas war – live updates
Body


The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has urged Israel not to be “consumed by rage” in its response to the Hamas attacks of 7 October  as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, acknowledged splits in Europe on the conflict.
Speaking from Kibbutz Be’eri – where at least 85 of the 1,200 people killed that day died and from where about 30 of the more than 240 were kidnapped – Borrell said “Israel must be defended”, but, “one horror does not justify another: innocent civilians, including thousands of children, have died in recent weeks.
“I understand your fears and your pain. I understand your rage. But let me ask you not to let yourself be consumed by rage.”
The diplomat also called for the “immediate and unconditional release” of those taken hostage by Hamas that day.
Macron, who was visiting Switzerland, urged an “immediate truce leading to a humanitarian ceasefire”, but admitted that “there is not a united position, to be honest, at the European level”.
The French foreign ministry spokesperson, Anne-Claire Legendre, meanwhile, accused Israeli settlers of a policy of terror in the West Bank aimed at displacing Palestinians, and urged Israeli authorities to protect Palestinians from the violence.
The warnings contrasted with Joe Biden, speaking after talks on Wednesday with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who defended his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. The US president said Hamas represented a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties. He said Israeli attacks would not stop until Hamas was no longer able to murder civilians.
Biden also said al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, which Israeli troops had entered earlier that day, had contained a Hamas underground command centre, justifying the raid – a claim repeated by the White House spokesperson John Kirby on Thursday.
Biden said it was likely Hamas activity existed at other hospitals in Gaza.
The heads of all the main UN agencies meanwhile announced they would not participate in helping citizens of Gaza be forced into Israeli-designated “safe zones” unless such zones had been agreed with all the parties, saying otherwise “they could cause large-scale loss of life”.
In a joint statement, the 18 heads of the main UN agencies said: “Without the right conditions, concentrating civilians in such zones in the context of active hostilities can raise the risk of attack and additional harm. No ‘safe zone’ is truly safe when it is declared unilaterally or enforced by the presence of armed forces.
“Any discussions around ‘safe zones’ must not detract from the parties’ obligation to take constant care to spare civilians – wherever they are – and meet their essential needs, including by facilitating rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all civilians in need.”
The head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Philippe Lazzarini, said separately he believed there was a deliberate attempt to “strangle” its humanitarian work in Gaza, warning that the agency may have to suspend its operations entirely due to a lack of fuel. He said the organisation had pleaded for weeks for access to fuel, which was transported into Gaza on Wednesday for the first time since the start of Israel’s war with Hamas, but it was nowhere near what Palestinians in the territory needed to survive.
Israeli forces had dropped leaflets telling Palestinians to flee parts of southern Gaza , residents told the Associated Press on Thursday, signalling a possible expansion of operations to areas where hundreds of thousands of people who heeded earlier evacuation orders in the north are crowded.
The leaflets, dropped in areas east of the southern town of Khan Younis, told civilians to evacuate the area and said anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions was putting their life in danger.
Some western officials said they feared that with more than 1.5 million Palestinians displaced from their homes in Gaza, they were going to be forced into tent cities in the south of the strip and this would put them under pressure to leave Gaza altogether, making their displacement “voluntary”.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, is expected to ask Israel to formally accept a resolution passed by the UN security council calling on Israel to accept a humanitarian pause of sufficient duration to allow aid to enter the country.
Brett Jonathan Miller, Israel’s deputy permanent representative, rejected the resolution, saying it was “detached from the reality on the ground”. But Israel will feel relieved by the degree of continued support that its military received from Biden, who argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been indiscriminate in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Palestinians are reported to have died.
He said: “It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. So this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.”
Western media on Thursday were poring over Israel’s decision to send troops into Shifa hospital in Gaza, and assessing the evidence the Israeli military had so far uncovered in support of its claim Hamas had used the hospital as a command centre. On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces released a video that they said showed some of the material recovered from a building in the hospital complex, including automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition and flak jackets.
Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, IDF spokesperson, told the BBC’s World at One: “Hamas unfortunately has had time to prepare for our advance. It has taken us time to get there. This time, it looks like, has been put into good use by Hamas to cover its tracks. This does not mean we will not find their infrastructure because they can take away mobile items like guns. We found a few yesterday in one of the clinics.”
He added the IDF had not yet searched the whole area and was looking for the access points to the underground infrastructure. “We are looking for tunnels within the compound and we will expand our searches, and I think in maybe a few days’ or weeks’ time we will be able to expose exactly what was or is under Shifa,” he said. 
Hamas denied the claim, which it said was “nothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza”.
It is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza.

"As antisemitism soars, for many Jews in France nowhere feels safe","

As antisemitism soars, for many Jews in France nowhere feels safe

Highlight: Macron is calling for unity, but the Israel-Hamas war has sparked a rise in hate crime that threatens a fragile social peace
Body


French Jews were only partly reassured when more than 100,000 people , including the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, and two former presidents, turned out to demonstrate in Paris last month  against antisemitism and in defence of the secular republic. Why did the president, Emmanuel Macron, not attend, many asked? Where were the leaders of France’s Muslim community? And where were the cultural, intellectual and sports celebrities so often eager to take a public stance on a worthy cause?
Since Hamas fighters poured into Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, slaughtering around 1,200  Israeli men, women and children, a wave of antisemitic attacks and hate speech has swept over France, home to Europe’s biggest Jewish community (of around 440,000  people) and its largest Muslim population (of around 6 million people).
“The Jews of France are afraid. What can we do?” a caller who identified herself only as Martine pleaded on a breakfast-time news programme this week. Yonathan Arfi, president of the Jewish Representative Council in France, says he hears from parents who have told their children not to wear kippah skullcaps or Star of David chains in the street or on public transport for fear of being attacked. Some Jews have taken their names off letterboxes and doorbells or changed the name on their Uber account for safety.
One of the country’s most popular radio and television entertainers, who uses the stage name Arthur (real name Jacques Essebag), shocked many fans when he revealed  that he had been living under guard since the day after the Hamas attacks. “This is France in 2023. I live in Paris and I have agents protecting me and my family because I’m Jewish. It’s crazy, no?” he said.
The interior ministry recorded more than 1,500 incidents  in the six weeks following 7 October, ranging from the desecration of cemeteries to antisemitic graffiti and banners, social media attacks, vandalism against Jewish property, threats against Jews and a handful of assaults. This is more than three times as many  as during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the early 2000s – the previous high-water mark for anti-Jewish hate offences.
Around Paris, hundreds of buildings were daubed with blue Stars of David  in a chilling throwback to the second world war Nazi occupation, when Jewish businesses and homes were marked for boycotts or roundups and deportations to death camps. Police now believe this was a Russian-inspired destabilisation operation rather than a home-grown intimidation campaign.
France is not alone in experiencing an upsurge in antisemitism. Similar spikes have been recorded in the UK and Germany. Old demons sometimes have new faces. Whereas it used to be mostly an extreme-right phenomenon, police say some of the most virulent antisemitism now comes from young people of Muslim origin, who identify with the Palestinians as victims and conflate French Jews with their Israeli oppressors. This generation has little awareness of the Holocaust, which history teachers struggle to teach  in many schools, or of the establishment of Israel as a refuge from persecution.
In June, the fatal police shooting of a 17-year-old driver  of Moroccan and Algerian descent in a Paris suburb sparked almost two weeks of riots across the country in which schools, buses and police stations were torched, shops looted, mayors assaulted and police attacked in nightly clashes. The violence, which did not specifically target Jews, was fuelled by widespread resentment of perceived police racism.
After earlier bouts of antisemitic violence, many Jews moved out  of the ethnically mixed suburbs that ring the capital. Some left France altogether and emigrated to Israel  – at the peak in 2015, the numbers reached 8,000 a year. Forty of those murdered by Hamas  on 7 October were French citizens, and eight French nationals were among the hostages abducted to Gaza.
Nowhere feels safe. In the southern town of Beaucaire, near my home, the local imam  was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence and barred from preaching for a year for having published comments on Facebook quoting a hadith calling for “fighting” and “killing” Jews, following the Hamas attacks.
Criticised by politicians, commentators and some Jewish leaders for staying away from the Paris rally, Macron said his role was not to demonstrate but to act to protect French Jews and preserve national unity. The government initially banned pro-Palestinian demonstrations as a threat to public order, but the highest state administrative court overturned the blanket ban  in the name of freedom of speech.
Macron is walking on eggshells because he is afraid of importing the Middle Eastern conflict into France. Each statement of support for Israel has been balanced by criticism of civilian casualties in Gaza and calls for a ceasefire. 
In a primetime television address  a few days after the Hamas massacre, Macron warned openly of the risk to civil peace in France. “Let us not embark on ideological adventures here out of imitation or projection,” the president said. “Let us not add national fractures to international fractures, and let us not tolerate any form of hatred. I appeal to you tonight: let us stay united – united for ourselves, united to jointly carry a message of peace and security for the Middle East.”
Yet the longer the Israel-Hamas war lasts, the harder it will be to insulate France’s fragile internal security from conflict across the Mediterranean.
                                                               Paul Taylor is a senior fellow of the Friends of Europe thinktank                                                                                                           Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Highlight: A sharp generational divide has been apparent as thousands have taken to the streets to call for a ceasefire and voice their disapproval of Biden’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza
Body


Since the start of Israel’s war in Gaza nearly two months ago, outraged young Americans have been at the forefront of a growing Palestinian solidarity movement.
They have led protests in Washington DC and across the country to demand a permanent ceasefire and to voice their disapproval of Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s military campaign, which has killed thousands of Palestinians, mostly women and children, and plunged Gaza into a humanitarian catastrophe.
A generational divide on the conflict is shifting the terms of the foreign policy debate in Washington, where support for Israel has long been bipartisan and near-unanimous. And, ahead of an already contentious election year, there are signs the issue could pose a threat to Biden’s prospects of winning re-election in 2024.
“There’s something profound taking place in the way young Americans, particularly Democrats, think about the issue,” said Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat professor for peace and development at the University of Maryland, who has studied American public sentiment on the Israeli-Palestine conflict for decades.
                                        Shifting                     attitudes                                      
There was a surge of support for Israel in the wake of the 7 October attack, when gunmen killed at least 1,200 people, roughly two-thirds of whom were civilians, and seized as many as 240 hostages, more than 100  of whom have been freed so far. But attitudes have evolved in the two months since, especially among young Americans, thousands of whom have taken to the streets in protest  of Israel’s air and ground offensive, which has killed at least 17,000 Palestinians and displaced more than three-quarters of the enclave’s 2.3 million residents.
Americans overall continue to sympathize  with Israel, but surveys show stark divides by party affiliation and age. Young Americans are far more likely than older Americans to express sympathy for Palestinians and to disagree  with Biden’s response  and strategy , a trend that is especially pronounced among Democrats.
It is the deepest shift in a short period of time that I’ve seen
  Shibley Telhami    
A pair of University of Maryland Critical Issues Polls , the first taken shortly after 7 October and the second taken four weeks after the attack, found that the number of  young Democrats who said Biden was “too pro-Israeli” had doubled while the percentage who said they were less likely to support him in 2024 based on his stance on the Israeli-Palestinian issue more than doubled.
“It is the deepest shift in a short period of time that I’ve seen,” said Telhami, who is the director of the Critical Issues Poll. While public attitudes often evolve during the course of a war, he said such a significant swing suggests “this isn’t episodic”.
Among voters 18-34, a majority – 52% – said they were more sympathetic to Palestinians than Israelis, according to a Quinnipiac University poll  released in mid-November. It marked a sharp reversal from the survey taken the previous month, after the 7 October assault , when 41% of young people said their sympathies lay with the Israelis, compared with 26% who said the Palestinians.
The poll also found young people were about equally divided between those who believe supporting Israel is in the US’s national interest – 47% – and those who don’t – 45% – compared with older cohorts who overwhelmingly said it was.
According to a recent NBC poll, a striking 70%  of voters ages 18 to 34 say they disapprove of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. A Pew poll published this week  charted a similar trend, with just 19% of Americans under 30 approving of the president’s response.
Watching a young, multiracial coalition champion Palestinian rights has been a glimmer of hope amid the horrors of war in Gaza and a rise in Islamophobia in the US,  said Nihad Awad, executive director and co-founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair). 
“We hope to see a break with the past,” said Awad, who is Palestinian American, “and a shift not only in the public opinion among young people but hopefully among the general public, ultimately towards a policy that reflects universal values of justice and freedom for all.”
                                        ‘What moral standing is there?’                                      
Many Americans of Biden’s generation can remember Israel as a young, left-leaning democracy founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust – a vulnerable country in a hostile region and a place the 81-year-old president has described as an indispensable haven for Jews. Biden, who was five at the time of Israel’s founding, has said: “If there weren’t an Israel, we’d have to invent one.”
Younger Democrats, by contrast, have mostly known Israel as a military power led by the rightwing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has aligned himself closely with Republicans in the United States and is accused of undermining  democratic institutions in Israel.
Those generational tensions have roiled the party, pitting young staffers against their bosses at the White House and at agencies across the administration , on Capitol Hill  and at the Democratic National Committee.  In letters, cables and in some cases, resignations, they have expressed their concern over the administration’s policy toward Israel.
Polling shows Biden’s support deteriorating among the nation’s youngest voters, considered a key part of the Democrats’ electoral coalition. In 2020, Biden won voters under 30 by more than 20 percentage points , according to exit polls. Recent surveys show the president competitive with  or in some cases trailing  Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, among young people.
What moral standing is there when you allow for more than 6,000 children to be killed?
  Zohran Mamdani    
Last month, a coalition of youth-centered progressive organizations signed an open letter  calling on Biden to support a ceasefire, which he has resisted, and warning that his approach to the war in Gaza “risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party next year”. Unless he changes course, they cautioned that Democrats would probably struggle to recruit the often young volunteers, organizers and staffers to work on Democratic campaigns.
“Biden ran on a promise to restore America’s moral standing in the world. What moral standing is there when you allow for more than 6,000 children to be killed?” said Zohran Mamdani, a 32-year-old Democratic state lawmaker from New York who staged a five-day hunger strike  outside of the White House to protest against Biden’s handling of the war. “If the fabric of your coalition was built on promises that you are betraying, you cannot be surprised if that coalition cannot be reactivated once more.”
In the days after 7 October, Biden condemned Hamas’s attack on Israel as “sheer evil”  and offered his administration’s unwavering support for Israel. The White House has argued that Biden’s strategy of standing by Israel as it wages war in Gaza has allowed his administration to push for diplomatic breakthroughs. The president has earned some praise for his administration’s efforts to restart the flow of desperately needed aid into the besieged region and to secure a week-long truce last month that saw the release of more than a hundred hostages held by Hamas.
Amid global outrage at the scale of the death and destruction in Gaza, the president and his administration have become more blunt  in expressing their concern over Israel’s military campaign as well as Israeli settler violence in the West Bank. 
“I have consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons: to accelerate and expand the humanitarian assistance going into Gaza and, two, to facilitate the release of hostages,” Biden said recently.
Many young activists, especially young Arab and Muslim Americans, say the president’s support for Israel is abetting a war that is already outpacing the bloodiest conflicts of the 21st century.  They have been alarmed by some of his rhetoric, particularly his comments questioning the veracity of the casualty figures kept by health officials in the Hamas-run enclave, which struck many as dehumanizing. And they say the fatal stabbing of a six-year-old Palestinian boy  and the shooting of three Palestinian students in Vermont  underscore the threat facing Arab and Muslim American communities.
“No amount of time will erase the last two months from our memory,” said Munir Atalla, 30, of the Palestinian Youth Movement.
                                        Why it’s happening                                      
Political scientists, activists and lawmakers on both sides of the debate say a range of factors are shaping the way young people perceive Israel’s war against Hamas. Social media, where young people have watched the horror of war unfold in real time on their cellphones, is one.
About a third of American adults under 30  say they regularly get their news from TikTok, where videos discussing the war have racked up billions of views.
Nerdeen Kiswani, 29, co-founder and leader of Within Our Lifetime, a Palestinian-led community organization that staged a peace protest  near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Times Square, New York, last month, said young people distrust traditional media. Instead, she said they rely on social media to hear directly from Palestinian civilians and journalists in Gaza.
“They can see with their own eyes,” she said. “Social media now has really democratized what news comes out there.”
But young people’s interest in Israel-Palestine – and the US’s approach to the conflict – is not new and the conversation is not only happening online, said Rachel Janfaza, the founder of the Up and Up  newsletter that explores gen Z political culture.
“While social media is one element of where young people are getting their news and information about what’s going on between Israel and Hamas,” she said, “there’s also a robust campus conversation about the conflict that predates the existence of TikTok.”
Many leftwing activists have embraced the Palestinian cause as an extension of the racial justice movement that mobilized following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. For them, the fight for Palestinian rights is linked to domestic causes like police brutality and climate justice.
“When I go to marches, when I go to rallies, when I go on hunger strike and I look around, these are the same people that I was marching with for Black Lives Matter,” said Mamdani. “That solidarity is at the crux of why so many young people are able to stand up for justice wherever it applies.”
A searing conversation over Palestinian rights has swept college campuses  and even high schools , where educators are struggling to foster civil discourse  as they confront a rise in bias attacks against Arab, Muslim and Jewish students. 
At protests, pro-Palestinian activists describe Israel as a “colonial” power and an oppressive, occupying force. Behind claims of anti-Israel bias, they see an effort to silence any criticism of the Israeli government, which many activists now charge with perpetrating a “genocide” against the Palestinian people.
Supporters of Israel have argued that viewing the Israel-Palestinian conflict through a lens of power and privilege often flattens the complex roots of the Israel-Palestine conflict and ignores Jewish people’s history of persecution. They say some of the slogans and rhetoric used by pro-Palestinian activists cross a line into antisemitism  and denialism of the atrocities of the 7 October attacks.
“It’s one thing to criticize Netanyahu, his policies,” said Tyler Gregory, 35, CEO of the Bay Area’s Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC). “It’s another thing to demonize Israel in the same way that Jews have been demonized for millennia, as being the source of the world’s problems.”
                                        Young Jewish people                                      
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has also divided young American Jews, a group that tends to be politically liberal  and secular. 
A survey by the Jewish Electorate Institute  conducted a month after the war began revealed a significant generational split among American Jews that mirrored the US population as a whole.
While nearly three-quarters of American Jews said they approve of Biden’s response to the conflict, it found that Jewish voters aged 18 to 35 were far more likely than their older counterparts to disapprove.
With chants of “not in our name”, young progressive Jewish activists have led several of the major ceasefire protests , some of which have drawn rebukes from prominent Jewish advocacy groups.
Meanwhile, young Jews were among  the tens of thousands of demonstrators who gathered  in Washington last month to show solidarity with Israel and voice support for its war against Hamas as calls for a ceasefire grow.
You cannot bomb your way to peace. That’s what young people are saying in the streets right now
  Eva Borgwardt    
Joe Vogel, a 26-year-old Maryland state delegate running for Congress, said it had been deeply worrying to see attempts from some on the left to “justify” the violence on 7 October.
“The only way that we’re really going to secure peace and justice for everyone in Israel and Palestine is if we move away from the binary thinking,” said Vogel, who is Jewish and describes himself as a “pro-Israel progressive”. “We have to be both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian. We have to be pro-Jewish and pro-Muslim.”
In 2020, Eva Borgwardt worked as a Democratic field director to help elect Biden in Arizona. Now the 27-year-old is helping to lead protests against him as the national spokesperson of IfNotNow, a leftwing Jewish group demanding the president back a permanent ceasefire.
“We know that the only way this horrific violence will end is with a ceasefire. You cannot bomb your way to peace,” she said. “That’s what young people are saying in the streets right now.”

Body


Call it war fatigue. So soon. Last week it was standing room only on both sides of the house for Rishi Sunak’s statement on Israel and Gaza. For the update on Monday there were plenty of gaps on the green benches. Especially on the Tory side. Already the Middle East has been filed under something too difficult, too unbearable and too far away. Most Conservatives no longer have the bandwidth for the conflict. They are too busy contemplating their own more immediate eternity. Losing the next general election.
Many of Sunak’s opening remarks were more or less a reprise of what he had said last week. Horror at the 7 October attacks on Israel by Hamas. A commitment to stand with Israel and a reaffirmation of its right to defend itself and to retrieve its hostages. An acknowledgment that the Palestinians are also victims of Hamas. Their need for humanitarian aid and for Israel to respond within international law. Hard to argue with any of that.
Where the script diverged slightly was in Rishi’s attempts to put himself centre stage. The tetchy school prefect sending himself out to cosplay the global statesman. You could hardly blame him, I suppose. His trip last week to the Middle East had to mean something more than a self-seeking photo opportunity. For his own self-worth at least. So what we got was Rish! as a Zelig character, squeezing himself into different moments of history.
First he was the hostage negotiator. It was largely down to his efforts that two Americans had been released last week.  Then there was the Zelig who had sat down with Benjamin Netanyahu, Mohammed bin Salman and Abdel Fatah al-Sisi and given them great insights into building peace in the Middle East. They would have been lost without him. Finally, he personally was responsible for opening the Rafah crossing.  He didn’t want to boast but credit where credit was due. This confused most MPs. They could have sworn that was Joe Biden’s win.
Sunak closed by saying that British intelligence had concluded the Gaza hospital had been destroyed by a militants’ rocket  – no one demurred – and that the BBC should be more careful in its reporting. Then a plea for a two-state solution. Good luck with that. That doesn’t seem to be on the shopping list of Netanyahu or Hamas. But you can always dream.
In reply, Keir Starmer chose to ignore Rish!’s fantasies about single-handedly winning the Nobel peace prize but otherwise pretty much mirrored the prime minister’s statement. Close your eyes and the two speeches were pretty much interchangeable. The Labour leader is taking the Commons speaking with one voice on this subject very seriously. He might have been marginally more accommodating to those of his MPs who wanted him to voice more support for the Palestinian people, but not much.
Once again, the SNP’s Stephen Flynn called for the government to advocate a ceasefire. To stop the violence – if only temporarily – and to allow essential humanitarian aid into Gaza. Flynn’s was not a lone voice. Many MPs from both sides of the Commons also appealed for a ceasefire.
But Sunak wouldn’t consider it. Not even as a possibility for the future. Israel had a right to defend itself. Hamas had forfeited whatever rights it may have had with its massacre of Israeli civilians. And as long as Hamas continued to keep hostages and launch rocket attacks on Israel, Israel could send down airstrikes on Gaza. Any Palestinian civilian casualties were the fault of Hamas. For embedding terrorists among an innocent population.
It had a logic. And an absence of logic. Any two-state solution – any solution at all come to think of it – has to start with both sides stopping wanting to kill the other. It’s as basic as that. But neither Hamas nor the Israelis are willing to back down and take that step. Decades of mistrust, hatred and violence prevent it. A ceasefire is the minimum requirement. Not just to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe but for any long-term solution. It’s international diplomacy 101. But a ceasefire is further away than ever. And Sunak and Starmer aren’t even pushing for one. Go figure.
Nor is Israel and Gaza an issue that splits along simple party lines. Everyone agrees that what Hamas has done is barbaric and unforgivable, but MPs on both sides were concerned that the government appeared to be giving the Israelis carte blanche to exact a collective punishment on the Palestinians in Gaza. Tory Vicky Ford wondered who was policing the Israeli response to make sure it was within international law.
Sunak just ummed and ahhed and waved his hands imperiously. The Israelis had assured him that they were following the letter of the law and that was good enough for him. Who was he to doubt them? Those airstrikes that wiped out entire Palestinian families were just one of those things. His assurances that all lives were equal were not entirely convincing.
Certainly many Labour MPs – especially those with large Muslim populations – in their constituencies were far from reassured. Jess Phillips also wanted to know what mechanisms were in place if international law was not observed. Er … none.
Zarah Sultana claimed there was already evidence that war crimes had been committed. Food, fuel, water and medical supplies had all been denied. Rish! again looked somewhat uncomfortable. Everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. He was sure the Palestinians were getting more than enough. The press cameras were lying. Things weren’t as bad as all that.
The most curious intervention came from the ever unreliable Theresa Villiers. She was outraged at reports that a Hamas leader had been allowed to buy a council house in the UK at a discount. AT A DISCOUNT! It would have been fine apparently if he had paid full whack. Jeremy Corbyn – a notable absentee last week – was in and calling for a humanitarian pause to the conflict.
Despite the former Labour leader making a point of condemning Hamas, Sunak merely went for the cheap shot of dismissing him as a friend of Hamas. Corbyn may have been wrong about a lot of things but he was right about this. There has to be an end to the killing at some point, otherwise an escalation of the war in the Middle East is inevitable. A ceasefire, however temporary, is a necessary waypoint to a two-state solution. Something has to give. And if Sunak was serious as a peacemaker he would make a stand.

                                                                                        Israel says it has refused a visa to the UN humanitarian affairs chief, Martin Griffiths, as a result of comments at the UN by secretary-general António Guterres.  Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said on army radio: “Due to his remarks we will refuse to issue visas to UN representatives. We have already refused a visa for the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs Martin Griffiths. The time has come to teach them a lesson.”                                                                                          Israel called on UN secretary general Guterres  to resign after he said the “appalling attacks”  by Hamas against Israel  on 7 October cannot justify the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people”, and spoke of “the clear violations of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing in Gaza”.                                                                                          Guterres had said: “Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians – or the launching of rockets against civilian targets. 
All hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions.”                                                                                          Addressing the UN, the secretary-general went on to say the attack on Israel did not happen “in a vacuum” and followed “56 years of suffocating occupation” for the Palestinian people by Israel, adding: “They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished. Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.”                                                                                          Erdan said Guterres should resign, calling the speech “shocking”, saying “he views the massacre committed by Nazi Hamas terrorists in a distorted and immoral manner”.                                                                                                                                The Palestinian Authority’s foreign minister Riyad al-Maliki, a rival of Hamas, denounced inaction by the UN security council. “ The ongoing massacres being deliberately and systematically and savagely perpetrated by Israel – the occupying power against the Palestinian civilian population under illegal occupation – must be stopped. It is our collective human duty to stop them,” he said.                                                                                          The UN’s agency for the relief of Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) last night warned it would be forced to halt its operations in Gaza  due to a lack of fuel as of Wednesday night.  UNRWA also said that its shelters are now four times over-capacity, with more than 600,000 internally displaced people sheltering in 150 facilities. It said “many people are sleeping in the streets as current facilities are overwhelmed”. In response, Israel’s military posted a picture of what it said were fuel tanks inside Gaza. “They contain more than 500,000 litres of fuel,” it wrote. “Ask Hamas if you can have some.”                                                                                          Israel’s ambassador to Australia has insisted the humanitarian situation in Gaza is “fair” after the Australian foreign minister Penny Wong’s warning that the besieged strip had “nowhere near enough” access to aid supplies.                                                                                          The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 6,546 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip by Israeli airstrikes since 7 October, including 2,704 children.  The figure includes 756 people – 344 of whom were children – killed in the last 24 hours. It said 17,439 had been wounded in total. It has not been possible for media organisations to independently verify the casualty figures being issued from Gaza.                                                                                          The rate of death and injuries of children in Gaza  is “simply staggering”, Unicef’s regional director for the Middle East and north Africa has said.  The UN’s children’s organisation said that a reported 2,360 children had been killed in Gaza due to “unrelenting attacks”. Adele Khodr said the number of child casualties were a “growing stain on our collective conscience”.                                                                                          Recep Tayyip Erdogan has told a group of MPs from his Justice and Development party (AKP) that Hamas is not a terrorist organisation, Israel’s actions in Gaza are “savage”, and that he has cancelled a planned trip to Israel. Turkey’s president was swiftly criticised for the comments, which Italian deputy PM labelled as “disgusting”.                                                                                          Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani of Qatar expressed the hope that there might be some movement on the release of hostages “soon”. He condemned what he termed “the collective punishment policy” inflicted by Israel on Gaza, saying that the only way to reach a peaceful solution in Gaza is to keep communication channels open.                                                                                          Eight aid trucks were allowed into Gaza late Tuesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said as the US President, Joe Biden, said efforts to deliver help via a crossing from Egypt were “not fast enough”. The UN had earlier said about 20 trucks had been unable to cross into Gaza from Egypt via the Rafah crossing.                                                                                          Eight Syrian military personnel have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on Deraa, Syrian state media has reported. The strikes targeted the Daraa countryside overnight, and came from the direction of the Golan Heights.                                                                 Syrian state TV also reported an Israeli air attack targeted Aleppo international airport.                                                                 Three people were killed in the West Bank, medics have said, after the Israeli military launched a drone attack on what it said was a group of armed Palestinians who “fired and hurled explosive devices”.                                                                 The Israeli military has accused Iran of having ordered recent attacks by Tehran-backed militias in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. It also claimed Iran was providing Hamas in Gaza with intelligence, and helping stoke anti-Israel sentiment globally with an online messaging campaign.                                                                 Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the 2023-24 national budget was “no longer relevant” given the war against Hamas and would be amended. He put the direct cost of the war at $246m a day (£202m/€232m).                                                                 French president Emmanuel Macron will meet today the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo. Czech prime minister Petr Fiala and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer are to arrive in Israel. Commentators have speculated that the stream of international leaders arriving in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem may also be partly aimed at delaying the expected ground invasion of Gaza.                                                                                          Pope Francis has renewed his calls for the release of hostages held by Hamas and for humanitarian aid to be allowed into the Gaza Strip.                                                                 The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has written to prime ministers and presidents across the EU ahead of a summit tomorrow afternoon to express “grave concern” at the growing crisis in Gaza.                                                                 UK immigration minister Robert Jenrick has suggested that visitors to the UK will be removed if they incite antisemitism, even if their conduct falls “below the criminal standard”.                                                                 The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said on social media that a plane delivering humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians is en route to Egypt.                                                                 A Palestinian American woman whose six-year-old son was killed in a Chicago suburb in what police called a hate crime  has asked the public to “pray for peace” as she recovers from her injuries.

Thursday briefing: Can US support for Israel’s war against Hamas survive ‘indiscriminate bombing’?

Body


Good morning.
The US and Israel have long had a special, albeit complicated, relationship. So when Hamas launched its brutal attack on 7 October, the Biden administration immediately offered Israel strong political and military support. Two and a half months into the bloody war in Gaza, the situation has changed significantly. The scale of death and destruction in the strip has meant that global support for Israel has weakened. This week the UN general assembly called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire  in Gaza after a resounding vote in which 153 member states out of 193 supported the resolution.
The US was one of only 10 countries that voted against the resolution – even the UK and Germany, who have been supporting Israel throughout the war, abstained, making Biden an increasingly lonely figure on the world stage.
However, reports of rising tensions between Israeli leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and president Biden have become increasingly common. The pair are said to be at odds over the handling of the conflict, which has left at least 18,000 people dead, with some estimates indicating that up to 70% of the fatalities have been women and children.
I spoke with the Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, about the fracturing relationship between the two states and how it could affect the way Israel prosecutes the war. That’s right after the headlines.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            Israel-Gaza war | Heavy winter rains have lashed Gaza , washing out tents and flooding some areas, as the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees described deteriorating conditions in the coastal strip as a “living hell”. Amid escalating shortages of food, spreading waves of communicable disease and the near collapse of Gaza’s health system, the winter storm turned large areas to mud.
                                            US politics | The House voted Wednesday to formally authorise the impeachment inquiry  into Joe Biden, even as Republicans have failed to produce evidence showing that the president financially benefited from his family’s business dealings.
                                            Economy  | Financial markets are betting the Bank of England will be forced to launch a deep round of interest rate cuts in 2024  amid the growing risk of a recession.
                                            UK news | A 16-year-old boy accused of killing Brianna Ghey has described freezing  as, he claimed, he saw his female co-defendant stab the teenager with his knife in a Warrington park.
                                            Education  | Under new proposals by the government’s campus free speech tsar , university staff and students can make provocative statements on subjects such as Israel and Gaza as long as they do not break laws on incitement or harassment. Universities and colleges in England that infringed the rights to expression of individuals could face fines under the new complaints process.
                   In depth: ‘Biden and his administration are getting more and more uneasy’                   
The UN vote has reinforced the idea that “the US and Israel are fairly isolated” in the face of increasing global calls for a ceasefire, Julian says. As Israel continues its bombardment of Gaza, the human cost of the conflict has become intolerable for most countries, who are demanding the two sides find a route to peace.
“It’s worth pointing out that the US made a big deal about how isolated Russia was in the general assembly when it came to the Ukraine war – by the same measures it’s an issue in which they are now in a relatively small minority,” Julian says.
But US support for Israel is seemingly not unconditional. Though the US has stood alongside Israel in this vote, Biden has also issued his bluntest public critique of Israel’s military strategy, saying that international support is waning because of the “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza, adding that Netanyahu should change his government, which is dominated by hard figures. The White House has tried to downplay  the president’s comments during a press conference to dispel any further speculation about Netanyahu and Biden’s relationship.
***
                     A rift between Netanyahu and Biden                   
Biden’s approach to the conflict has been to keep Netanyahu close, in a bid to exert more influence over the way Israel prosecutes the war. The Biden administration believes it has achieved some wins with this policy: “They believe that they helped fend off a pre-emptive strike on Lebanon against Hezbollah, which there was support for in the immediate aftermath [of the attack],” Julian says. However when it comes to minimising civilian casualties and long-term plans for the military campaign, the Biden administration has held little sway over the Israeli government. Civilian deaths remain high and Netanyahu has made clear that he will not allow any kind of Palestinian control over Gaza in future. “Biden and his administration are getting more and more uneasy about their lack of influence,” Julian says.
***
                     Conflicting ideas                   
News that the US has given Israel a deadline  of the end of December to finish the conflict has been widely reported in the Israeli press  (though a White House aide has denied  the existence of any firm deadline). The Israel Defense Forces have said that they are prepared to keep the conflict going until the end of January, Julian says.
It is unclear what happens when these deadlines are reached: the IDF has proposed maintaining a significant military presence in the north of the strip, as well as creating a buffer zone inside Gaza – a policy that the US has publicly opposed. “Instead, Washington wants to use this conflict as leverage to get back on to a trajectory towards a two-state solution, which is something that Netanyahu and his cabinet are really against. So they are very much at loggerheads,” Julian says.
***
                     Internal pressure                   
Biden has his own problems to think about. His support for Israel’s war in Gaza has caused a significant backlash from certain factions of his own party. With the president facing re-election next year, he is likely evaluating the political cost of maintaining his stance because “support for him on the left of his party has really suffered, particularly among progressives, young people and minorities”, Julian explains.
***
                     Military impact                   
While the relationship between the two countries has become frostier in recent weeks, US officials made it clear that there are no current plans to slow the supply of munitions to Israel.
US support for Israel is not guaranteed indefinitely, however: “The last round of munitions was sent through an emergency measure that sidestepped Congress in quite an unusual move. As relations sour between Biden and Netanyahu, I can’t imagine they would do that again,” Julian says. “They can, very easily, put their thumb on the flow of ammunition, which the Israel Defense Forces really depend on, if they want to.” 
This week Biden warned Israel that “they’re starting to lose” international support. Though fraught conversations are certainly happening in the background, Biden, for the moment, has promised to support Israel’s right to defend itself. He said: “We’re not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process. Not a single thing.”
                   What else we’ve been reading                                                                                        Andre Braugher (pictured above), who held the antics of Brooklyn Nine-Nine together with his gravitas and charisma, is mourned by many.

There was no other candidate who could come close to leading the National Theatre than its next artistic director, Indhu Rubasingham, writes the Guardian’s chief theatre critic, Arifa Akbar.  “Rubasingham is too talented and experienced to sacrifice quality for any of the risks she takes – and I do hope she takes a few,” Arifa writes. “She knows how to combine brilliant new writing with crowd-pleasers, and how to stage canonical works with verve.”
An inspiring leader at London’s Kiln theatre, Rubasingham is the first woman and first woman of colour in the job. “She is not the first woman who was qualified for the job,” writes Arifa, “yet here she is, making theatre history with a long overdue gender correction.” Rubasingham, who has an MBE for her services to theatre, starts what she has called “the best job in the world“ in spring 2025.

‘We feel totally abandoned’: doctors and aid workers fight to survive in Gaza

Highlight: Conditions deteriorating rapidly and healthcare particularly badly hit as bombing and fighting continuesIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Doctors and aid workers in Gaza say they have been abandoned by the international community to a “humanitarian tragedy” as they “fight to survive” after almost four weeks of war between Israel and Hamas.
With widespread destruction in urban areas and basic services collapsing amid continuing airstrikes, artillery bombardments and close-quarters fighting, little remains of the former lives of the 2.3 million inhabitants of the territory, said many of those who spoke to the Guardian.
Israel has placed Gaza under a near-total blockade since it launched its effort to destroy Hamas after the murderous attacks by the Palestinian militants in southern Israel on 7 October that killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Hamas also seized more than 240 hostages, including infants and elderly people.
Power, food and clean water has become increasingly difficult to find, while an almost total lack of fuel has emptied Gaza’s usually busy roads and stopped many generators.
At least 9,227 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli offensive began, including 3,826 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. It is unclear how many of the dead were combatants.
“It is a terrible situation, a real catastrophe … We feel totally abandoned, left alone, left by ourselves,” said Dr Shawqi Muhaisen, a well-known neurologist in Gaza.
Conditions inside the UN-run schools and compounds where about 700,000 people have sought shelter are deteriorating rapidly. Witnesses report acute overcrowding, the spread of infectious diseases, inadequate washing facilities and limited water.
Healthcare has been particularly badly hit. One UN administrator described hiring a donkey cart to search the few pharmacies that remained open for vital medicine for his sick 76-year-old mother.
“It was dangerous because of the airstrikes, but you do what you have to do for your loved ones,” said the administrator, who was not authorised to talk to the media.
An NGO worker in northern Gaza, where the most intense bombing and fighting has been taking place, described a similar frantic search to find a doctor to treat an elderly relative and then for clean syringes.
“All the hospitals were overflowing with casualties from the airstrikes. I saw appalling scenes. Children with their faces covered in blood, mothers crying as they searched for their children, fathers carrying their daughters and crying like babies,” said Mahmoud Chalabi, a programme manager in Beit Lahiya for the UK-based charity Medical Aid for Palestinians.
More than a third of Gaza’s hospitals are no longer functioning, putting remaining facilities under massive pressure. There are reports of operations carried out by torchlight, without anaesthetic and with vinegar used as a disinfectant.
Muhaisen, 54, said he had abandoned hope of ever treating hundreds of patients who depended on him for vital care as his clinic, equipment and home had all been destroyed. In the compound at Khan Younis, where he was sheltering with his family, 24 toilets served an estimated 22,000 people.
“It is a terrible situation, a real catastrophe, there is a shortage of medicine. We have to queue for hours for the toilet. I am restricting what I eat and drink so I don’t have to go to the bathroom,” he said.
Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, arrived in Tel Aviv on Friday  to meet Israel’s war cabinet and urge greater restraint in its campaign to destroy Hamas.
An Israeli military spokesperson said on Friday that the aim of the offensive was to eradicate the political and military capabilities of Hamas and ensure that no repeat of the 7 October attacks was possible.
“This will take as long as it will take,” said Lt Col Richard Hecht, who accused Hamas of deliberately placing rocket launch sites next to UN-run schools and stockpiling precious fuel.
In an attempt to justify its refusal to allow fuel into Gaza, the Israeli army released a recording of a conversation that it said featured a Hamas health ministry official who admitted that the organisation kept fuel stockpiles beneath Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Though 68 trucks  carrying medical and other supplies entered the enclave on Thursday, conditions across Gaza continued to deteriorate.
Yasmin Sharraf, 37, told the Guardian she had sought shelter three weeks ago at a UN-run vocational training compound outside Khan Younis after fleeing her home in Gaza City.
“It is very horrible. It is a very crowded place. My kids are very sick with chickenpox and some respiratory infection but I cannot get them proper care,” Sharraf said. “We are all sleeping in our car together so now I am sick too.”
Periodic shutdowns by Israel, lack of power and damage from bombing has rendered much of the communications network inoperable, residents said.
“We felt totally isolated. It was really a torture. And I couldn’t connect with the rest of the family. We try to check on each other all the time. When we finally got through, my wife was crying with relief,” said one journalist who moved from Gaza City to Nuseirat refugee camp at the beginning of the conflict.
“We were really worried, we were thinking is this the end, do they want to isolate the place to do what they want without anybody hearing.”
The Israeli army said airstrikes across Gaza had targeted Hamas military command centres hidden in civilian area and that sometimes ambulances were used by Hamas to transport its fighters.
There are widespread concerns over the mental health of children and that of their parents, too. In the compound in Khan Younis, a UN administrator said he had told his young children that they had left home to go camping, hiding the truth that the house he and they had grown up in was in ruins.
“Now they just say they want to sleep in their own beds and cry all the time. I don’t know what to say any more,” said the administrator, who requested anonymity.
Others said they had not told their children about relatives and friends who had been killed or badly injured in an effort to spare them further trauma and fear.
“They ask me when it is going to be over and I tell them all things come to an end,” the UN administrator said. His uncle and several cousins were killed two weeks ago.
Muhaisen, the neurologist, said he dreaded the coming days. “Nobody cares truly about human rights. There is lots of talk but then no one takes any action. No one cares … We have no hope. I think the worst is still to come,” he said.

Highlight: Offensive launched from Gaza represents large failure of Israeli intelligence and is likely to have long-lasting repercussionsIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


                                        What happened on the border between Israel and Gaza on Saturday?                                      
Shocked Israelis woke on the last day of the Jewish high holidays to the wail of sirens as Hamas and Islamic Jihad fired thousands of rockets from Gaza and armed militants broke down the hi-tech barriers surrounding the strip to enter Israel, shooting and taking hostages.  Militants in boats also tried to enter Israel by sea.
It was a staggering and unprecedented offensive by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and a catastrophic intelligence failure  by Israel – and both will have long-lasting repercussions and consequences. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared that Israel was at war and that Palestinians would pay a heavy price.
Militants infiltrated Jewish communities near the border with Gaza, killing and seizing civilians and soldiers. Unverified videos showed terrified Israelis covered in blood, and with hands tied behind their backs, being taken by Palestinian gunmen. Many people rushed to safe rooms in their homes as the carnage unfolded around them.
Hundreds of young people at an all-night dance festival in southern Israel found themselves under fire. “They were going tree by tree and shooting. Everywhere. From two sides. I saw people were dying all around,” said one survivor.  Authorities later said that 260 bodies had been recovered.
By nightfall on Saturday, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) estimated there were still 200-300 Palestinian militants inside Israel. There were eight “points of engagement” where the IDF was trying to regain control from militants.
                                        How did Israel respond?                                      
Israel called up army reservists and launched a wave of airstrikes on the tiny strip, which is home to 2.3 million people. Netanyahu warned Palestinians in Gaza to “get out of there now” as he vowed to reduce Hamas hideouts to “rubble”, but there is nowhere for those in the blockaded territory to escape to.
Warplanes targeted several buildings in the centre of Gaza City, including Palestine Tower, an 11-storey building that houses Hamas radio stations.
Israel has indicated it may launch a ground invasion, although this would carry huge risks both for IDF troops and for Israeli hostages being held in the territory.
Israel has cut off electricity and fuel supplies to Gaza, which may soon affect the strip’s medical facilities that are already under extreme pressure from people injured in the bombardment.
Video recorded in Gaza showed a mosque destroyed in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, and several large buildings in Gaza City in ruins.
Palestinians in Gaza shared images of text messages sent by the Israeli military to people in the Beit Hanoun area in the north of the strip that ordered them to leave their homes before the airstrikes.
                                        How many people have been killed and injured? And how many Israelis have been taken hostage?                                      
At least 700 Israelis were killed and about 2,000 people were being treated in hospitals – 19 of them in critical condition – according to reports on Sunday.
The IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said more than 400 Palestinian militants had been killed in southern Israel and the Gaza Strip, and dozens more had been captured.
The Palestinian health ministry said that at least 400 Palestinians had been killed, including 20 children, and nearly 2,000 wounded as a result of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza since Saturday. Seven people were also killed by Israeli army fire in the West Bank, including a child, it said.
Hamas has reportedly taken as many as 100 Israelis hostage – both soldiers and civilians, alive and dead.
                                        Why did Hamas and Islamic Jihad launch the attack?                                      
The exact reasons for the attack are not clear, but there has been growing violence for months between Israeli soldiers and settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank. Armed settlers have attacked Palestinian villages; militants in the West Bank have attacked soldiers and settlers, and there have been repeated IDF raids on Palestinian cities.
During the past week, some Jews have prayed inside the compound of al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. The area around the mosque is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and is the third holiest place for Islam after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. To Jews, it is known as Temple Mount, and is venerated as the site of the biblical Jewish temple. Jews are not permitted to pray inside al-Aqsa compound; to do so is highly provocative. Hamas has called its current offensive Operation al-Aqsa Deluge.
The longer backdrop is a 16-year blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt that has almost destroyed the strip’s internal economy and has caused hardship for the people living there.
Extreme religious nationalists who are part of Israel’s rightwing coalition government have repeatedly called for the annexation of Palestinian territory. There has also been speculation that the offensive could have been encouraged by Iran as a means of scuppering moves by Saudi Arabia to normalise relations with Israel.
                                        Why did the attack take Israel by surprise?                                      
Hamas must have planned this offensive for many months, and it is a mystery why Israeli intelligence appears to have had no idea it was coming.
Israel’s surveillance of Gaza is intense. It monitors activity, communications and daily life via state-of-the-art surveillance equipment, including drones flying over the strip. It also relies on human intelligence via informants, many of whom are blackmailed or otherwise coerced into assisting Israel.
The intelligence failure is monumental, and will shake the Israeli public’s faith in their government and army’s ability to protect civilians.
“All of Israel is asking itself: where is the IDF, where are the police, where is the security?” said Eli Maron, a former head of the Israeli navy, on Channel 12. “It’s a colossal failure; the [defence] establishments have simply failed, with vast consequences.”
                                        What does Hamas hope to gain?                                      
The militant organisation that has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007 has shown the world that it is a force to be reckoned with, but it is hard to see how there can be a positive outcome for Hamas or Gaza from the events this weekend.
Israel is likely to use the full force of its military might to crush militant activity, not just in Gaza but also the West Bank and East Jerusalem. In the process, a huge number of Palestinian civilians are likely to be killed, and homes and infrastructure destroyed.
The hostage-taking will also complicate Israel’s response and gives Hamas a significant bargaining chip. Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held in Gaza by Hamas for five years, was finally released in 2011 in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.
If Iran is involved, it will hope the violence will scupper any deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.
                                        Does Hamas have the support of ordinary people in Gaza?                                      
Many people in Gaza just want to get on with their lives, free from the blockade and repeated wars and conflicts. They resent the restrictions imposed on them and the fear instilled in them by Hamas rulers.
However, others are driven to take up arms by the lack of hope and the misery that is characteristic of life in Gaza. They see militant action as the only way of asserting themselves and fighting for a better future.
Support for Hamas has not been tested since the last elections in Gaza in 2006.
                                        What has been the international reaction to the Hamas offensive?                                      
There has been overwhelming condemnation of Hamas and support for Israel’s right to defend itself. Joe Biden told Netanyahu  that the US “stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults … My administration’s support for Israeli’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”
The UN security council held an emergency meeting on Sunday to discuss the crisis. Meanwhile, UN peacekeeping forces have been deployed along the Lebanon-Israel border to “maintain stability and help avoid escalation”.
The Egyptian government said it was in talks with Saudi Arabia and Jordan to try to find a way to defuse the crisis. Egypt has been heavily involved in brokering ceasefires in the past.

Body


The Israeli death toll after the surprise attack by the militant group Hamas on communities in the country’s south has risen to at least 700, including 44 soldiers, as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was embarking on a “long and difficult war”.
In Gaza, which was pummelled by Israeli airstrikes , officials reported at least 413 deaths.
With thousands of Israelis and Palestinians wounded since Saturday morning, Israel said more than 100 Israeli citizens, including women and children, were believed to have been abducted at gunpoint by Hamas to Gaza.
At least 260 bodies were discovered at the site of a music festival in a desert kibbutz. Many of the Israeli victims were civilians who were murdered in their homes, on the streets of their communities and at other locations along a broad swathe of territory bordering Gaza, leading the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to describe the Hamas assault as an “indiscriminate terrorist attack”.
Blinken added that Washington had not seen any evidence that Iran was behind the attack.
Several Americans were killed by Hamas attackers, a White House national security council spokesperson confirmed, saying the US would continue to monitor the situation closely.
In a call to Netanyahu, Joe Biden said US military assistance was “now on its way to Israel with more to follow over the coming days”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier and its strike group of warships would be moved closer to Israel in the Mediterranean while US air force squadrons in the region would be reinforced in a show of strength.
As Israel’s security cabinet signed off on a wide-ranging authorisation for military action, Israelis were struggling to comprehend the scale of Saturday’s attack, as the likelihood of a ground invasion of Gaza and a wider conflagration with Hezbollah in Lebanon loomed large.
On Sunday afternoon waves of Israeli jets were carrying out “intense” strikes on targets in Gaza. Dozens of Israeli armoured vehicles and tanks were heading towards Gaza, suggesting preparations were under way for a ground offensive.
In a televised address on Saturday night, Netanyahu said the Israeli military would use all of its strength to destroy Hamas’s capabilities in response.
“Get out of there now,” he told people in Gaza, who have no way to leave the tiny, overcrowded Mediterranean territory.
The number of Israeli dead climbed sharply on Sunday as Israel’s forces secured areas that had been briefly seized by Hamas militants in the country’s south, and emergency workers uncovered scores of bodies.
At an emergency reception centre for desperate families of the missing at Ben Gurion airport, Nava Avadia, 60, said her son Etai Hadar, 27, was at a party when the attacks took place. “His girlfriend managed to make a call to her sister saying they escaped into the kibbutz from the field where the party was, but since then we have heard nothing.
“We hope it is just they have no battery. We have no idea. We pray for good news. The army won’t let us go down there.”
The growing list of the dead represented every corner of Israeli society including a commando general, a former Israeli international football player, partygoers and families, including women and children.
As Israel struck 800 targets in Gaza, the official toll of Palestinians killed there rose to more than 400 including 20 children, with close to 2,000 people wounded.
At a UN-run school in Gaza City’s north-western Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood, residents described overnight Israeli strikes that hit the school’s courtyard, causing panic and light injuries among those sheltering there.
At another school serving as a shelter in central Gaza City, people were piling up blankets and food in the three-storey building. New arrivals brought in mattresses, packing their children into small and crowded classrooms.
“We didn’t know where to go,” said Umm Muhammad, a resident of a district on the eastern borders of Gaza. She described waking up in the middle of the night to screams, strikes and calls for evacuation. “We arrived at the schools miraculously, because there was no transport.”
Israel announced on Sunday it had ordered the evacuation of communities bordering Gaza, while thousands of reservists reported for duty and more received call-ups as a state of emergency was expected to be formalised on Monday.
Israel’s war aims remained unclear on Sunday , including whether it would seek to remove Hamas from power in Gaza, and how long any operation might last.
Yohanan Plesner, the head of the Israel Democracy Institute, said the declaration of war was largely symbolic, but “demonstrates that the government thinks we are entering a more lengthy, intense and significant period of war”.
Underlining the international alarm over the escalating events, Poland announced it would send military planes to evacuate its citizens from Israel.
While the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they had retaken control of more than 20 locations attacked by Hamas, fighting reportedly continued in Kfar Aza where gunmen belonging to the militant Islamist group were said to be holed up.
As the UN security council prepared to go into an emergency session later on Sunday and the UN secretary general, António Guterres, urged “maximum restraint”, the Iranian-backed armed group Hezbollah said it had fired rockets and artillery into northern Israel “in solidarity” with the Palestinian people.
Israeli forces responded with artillery strikes on Lebanon and a drone attack on a Hezbollah post near the border, the military said. Later on Sunday afternoon, people in northern Israel reported interceptions by a Patriot missile battery. There were also reports on Sunday afternoon that Israel was preparing to evacuate communities along the Lebanon border.
As the scale of the deaths and injuries on both sides of conflict became apparent, the Israeli police service alone said it had lost 30 officers in the first day of fighting, while the Shin Bet domestic security agency said five of its members had been killed. As relatives of missing Israelis gathered at hospitals and made online appeals, the Israeli military opened a call centre for families of “unresponsive” soldiers seeking information about their fate.
Among those listed among the dead on the IDF memorial page was Amir Fisher, a general in a commando brigade.
Hezbollah said in a statement that its rocket and artillery attacks had targeted three posts including a “radar site” in the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms, a slice of land occupied by Israel since 1967 that Lebanon claims.
Meanwhile, in neighbouring Egypt a police officer shot dead two Israeli tourists and an Egyptian at a tourist site in Alexandria, the country’s interior ministry said.
On Saturday, backed by a barrage of rockets, hundreds of Hamas operatives broke out of Gaza and fanned out into 22 Israeli towns, shooting at civilians in an attack that stunned Israel. 
Video footage showed several people being abducted by gunmen. In some places, militants roamed for hours, targeting civilians and soldiers, as Israel’s military scrambled to muster a response. 
Early on Sunday, the Israeli military said its forces were still fighting incursions by the militant group in eight places, and that two hostage situations had been “resolved”, but did not clarify whether all the hostages had been rescued alive.
Survivors of the Hamas assault in various locations described playing dead under the bodies of family members or fleeing through fields from gunmen on motorbikes pursuing attendees at a rave near the border.
As Israel prepared for a substantial ground invasion of Gaza, the Israeli cabinet announced it had cut off all electricity, fuel and goods going into Gaza.
In his televised address on Saturday night, Netanyahu, who had earlier declared Israel to be at war, said the military would use all of its strength to destroy Hamas’s capabilities and “take revenge for this black day”. He said: “This war will take time. It will be difficult.”
“All the places that Hamas hides in, operates from, we will turn them into rubble,” he added. 
Hamas and Israel have already fought four wars since the group took over the strip in 2007.
Much of Gaza was thrown into darkness by nightfall after electricity from Israel, which supplies almost all of the territory’s power, was cut off earlier in the day. 
The Hamas incursion fell on Simchat Torah, a normally joyous day when Jews complete the annual cycle of reading the Torah scroll.
Several airlines have cancelled flights into Israel and the Federal Aviation Association issued a warning to US pilots to use caution over Israeli airspace.
Biden said on Saturday  he had spoken to Netanyahu to say the US “stands with the people of Israel in the face of these terrorist assaults. Israel has the right to defend itself and its people, full stop”.
Saudi Arabia, which has been in talks with the US about normalising relations with Israel, called on both sides to exercise restraint. The kingdom said it had warned repeatedly about the danger of “the situation exploding as a result of the continued occupation [and] the Palestinian people being deprived of their legitimate rights”.

Body


As cold, driving rain swept across the rubbish- and rubble-strewn streets of Rafah early on Wednesday morning, residents of the crowded city in the south of Gaza set out to celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan and the festival of Eid al-Fitr.
Prayers were held in mosques badly damaged in the continuing Israeli offensive, in the crowded schools where many have lived since being forced to flee ruined homes elsewhere in the territory, and on the sand among the rows of tents now home to hundreds of thousands.
By noon, the clouds had cleared but the spring sun brought little of the warmth usually associated with a day of faith, friendship and family.
“It doesn’t feel like Eid because of the lack of a beautiful atmosphere, and we are not buying clothes and sweets, or gathering together like we usually do,” said Jana Muhammad Sorour, a 12-year-old dispatched by her displaced family to sell homemade goods to neighbours in Rafah to raise much-needed funds.
“I hope that the war will stop and that I will get clothes and candy like other holidays, and most importantly, go home.”
For Islam Wahba, 35, who fled to Rafah after her home in Nuseirat was destroyed in an airstrike, the festival brought new grief. Since the war started six months ago, her husband and six relatives have been killed.
“When the prayers began, I started crying because it was my first Eid without my husband and so many of my family. When my children woke up, they began to look at pictures of their father and wish him a happy Eid. This is not Eid and cannot be Eid,” she said.
The war began on 7 October when Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages. Since then, Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 33,000 in Gaza, mostly civilians, and created an acute humanitarian crisis.
Israeli military officials blame civilian casualties on Hamas, saying the organisation use civilians as “human shields”. Hamas denies the accusation.
Most of the enclave’s 2.3 million people are homeless. Hospitals have been destroyed and medicine is in short supply.
More than 1 million people are crammed into Rafah , on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, having fled bombardments further north.
Basics in the city are in short supply. Many are surviving on flatbread cooked over wood fires or basic gas hobs, and tinned goods trucked in by humanitarian agencies from Egypt. 
Sugar, fresh fruit and vegetables are rare and very expensive. Salt is almost unobtainable. Banking services have also collapsed, leaving many short of cash, even if they have funds.
Electricity was cut off by Israel at the beginning of the conflict, most of the sanitation and power infrastructure has been destroyed and the minimal amounts of fuel allowed into the territory are insufficient for running pumps or generators. Everywhere, donkey carts  have replaced cars as the principal mode of transport.
Looming over all those trying to celebrate Eid in Rafah is the prospect of an imminent attack by Israeli forces.  Israeli officials say Hamas leaders are based in the city along with four battalions of militants – the only substantial remaining fighting force of the Islamist organisation.
“Israeli troops are continuing to operate in the central Gaza Strip and killed a number of terrorists over the past day,” the Israeli Defense Forces said on Wednesday, while aircraft had “struck dozens of terror targets in the Gaza Strip, including military sites, launchers, tunnel shafts and infrastructure”.
Though Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has vowed repeatedly to continue to seek “total victory”, the US state department has warned Israel that “a full-scale military invasion of Rafah would have an enormously harmful effect” on civilians and “would ultimately hurt Israel’s security”.
More trucks bearing humanitarian aid have entered Gaza in recent days than for many months, but aid officials say much more is needed. Israel has been criticised repeatedly for blocking or slowing aid – charges it denies.
“Any aid is completely inadequate,” said Melanie Ward, chief executive of Medical Aid for Palestinians, who left Gaza after visiting Rafah on Wednesday morning.
“Everyone in Rafah is living in absolute desperation and fear of what is about to happen. There are thousands and thousands of people, so close together. There are no water supplies, lakes of raw sewage everywhere … and children sitting by the roadside with pans begging for food,” she added.
Israeli authorities said  on Wednesday that they were “surging aid into Gaza, with over 1,200 trucks entering in three days”.
In Rafah, Abir Sakik, 40, who fled her home in Gaza City with her family and is now living in a tent, said she had no “ingredients for the cakes and sweets” she would usually make.
Instead she made cakes from crushed dates. “We want to rejoice despite all the blood, death and shelling. We are tired and weary … enough, enough of war and destruction,” she said.
Jalal Al Khalidi, 48, from Gaza city, said it was impossible to celebrate.
“I did not sleep at all last night thinking about what I will do, who will keep me company during day, who will pray the Eid prayer with me, with whom I will eat breakfast today, and with whom I will visit my relatives. The joy of Eid disappeared with the loss of my family.”
Asmaa Al Sayed, aged nine, described the festival as “a war holiday”.
“This means no joy, no holiday atmosphere, no sweets, no security, and, most importantly, no home,” she said.

Highlight: Ground forces are gathering near the border, as UN says that Gaza is dangerously close to running out of food and waterIsrael-Hamas war: live updates
Body


The US pledged to send more arms to Israel on Thursday ahead of an expected ground assault in Gaza against Hamas, as the UN warned food and water supplies were running dangerously low in the blockaded enclave.
As America’s top diplomat flew into Israel following Saturday’s surprise cross-border assault by Hamas, the UK announced it would send two navy ships and would begin surveillance flights in its own show of support.
Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, pledged his country’s support for Israel “today, tomorrow, every day”.He told the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on a visit to the region that Israel “may be strong enough on your own to defend yourself but, as long as America exists, you will never, ever have to. We will always be there by your side  ”.
The declaration of solidarity came as Israeli troops continued to build close to Gaza before an expected ground invasion. Intense bombing of the narrow territory that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians continued for a sixth consecutive day as concerns mounted about the humanitarian crisis.
Israel declared war on Hamas on Saturday after hundreds of Islamic militants broke through the Gaza security fence to massacre approximately 1,300 people in Israel, including children. Gunmen seized a further 150 people, who are now being held hostage inside Gaza.
The death toll in Gaza rose above 1,400, including 447 children and 248 women, Gaza’s health ministry said, as Israel Defence Forces strikes continued to pound buildings and neighbourhoods.
Although Blinken offered unwavering support to Israel and condemned Hamas’s “reign of terror”, he also spoke of the Palestinian people’s “legitimate aspirations to live with equal measures of security, freedom, justice, opportunity and dignity”.
He told Netanyahu: “I come before you not only as the United States secretary of state but also as a Jew” and “a husband and father of young children …
“It’s impossible for me to look at the photos of families killed, such as the mother, father and three small children murdered as they sheltered in their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz, and not think of my own children.”
He added that he had seen photographs and videos in meetings including of a baby riddled with bullets, soldiers beheaded and young people burned alive in their cars or hideaways. “It’s simply depravity in the worst imaginable way,” Blinken said.
One picture was posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, by the official account of the Israeli government on Thursday. “This is the most difficult image we have ever posted but we need each and every one of you to know,” the post read, above a picture of a dead baby whose face had been blurred. “This happened.”
Netanyahu said he appreciated US support, adding that Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, should be treated like Islamic State. “Just as Isis was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed,” he said.
In an indication that the conflict is expected to be protracted, some countries – including the UK, Canada and Belgium – began evacuating their nationals from Israel.
Israel said there would be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all hostages held by Hamas were released.
The energy minister, Israel Katz, wrote on social media that no “electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter” until the “abductees” were free.
The UN considers the tightened siege a war crime, and the 16-year-blockade is illegal under international humanitarian law.
“It’s a dire situation in the Gaza Strip that we’re seeing evolve with food and water being in limited supply and quickly running out,” said Brian Lander, the deputy head of emergencies at the UN World for Food Programme.
The World Health Organization warned that the health system in the Gaza Strip is “at breaking point” and “time is running out to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe”.
Residents were sifting through rubble looking for survivors and bodies. Eighteen healthcare facilities and 20 ambulances had been affected by the bombardment, and 11 healthcare workers killed, the World Health Organization said.
The UN said late on Wednesday the number of people displaced by the airstrikes had soared by 30% within 24 hours to 339,000 – two-thirds of them crowding into UN schools. Palestinian media said that bombing had killed the brother of Mohammed Deif, Hamas’s military commander, and a senior commander from Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Hazem Balousha, the Guardian’s reporter in Gaza, reached by phone on Thursday morning, said the strip’s residents had been told that hospitals had stopped admitting all but emergency cases.
Rafah, Gaza’s crossing point with Egypt, remained closed, and the only power station ran out of fuel on Tuesday, leaving the strip powered by scattered private generators. Those will shut off as well if fuel is not allowed in and the Red Cross has pleaded for fuel deliveries in order to prevent overwhelmed hospitals from “turning into morgues”.
In Israel, the reported death toll climbed to 1,300. Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters that forces were preparing for a ground assault but that the political leadership had not yet ordered one. Netanyahu, who now leads a newly formed unity government and war cabinet , including members of the opposition, has vowed to “crush and destroy” Hamas.
Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist National Unity party, a former defence minister and a strident critic of Netanyahu’s current far-right government, said: “We are all in this together. This is not a political partnership, but rather a unity of fate. This is the time to close ranks and to win.”
Blinken is expected to meet the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Friday before visiting Qatar.
Abbas, whose Fatah movement lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007, said on Thursday: “We reject the practices of killing civilians or abusing them on both sides because they contravene morals, religion and international law,” according to official Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Blinken’s visit coincides with the arrival of a US aircraft carrier in the region, amid fears that the war could escalate, drawing in Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, and Palestinian factions in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem. In the West Bank, clashes in several areas have erupted between Palestinians and IDF troops, as well as Israeli settlers.
A ground offensive in Gaza is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of nearby residents.
Strategic planning has been complicated by the presence of Israeli hostages, among them children and elderly people, inside the Gaza Strip.
Israel’s Army Radio, citing a foreign diplomat, said that those kidnapped had been spread out across the enclave, some being held in private houses, and the factions themselves were not sure of the total number of hostages.

Highlight: In today’s newsletter: From climate finance to greenhouse gases, a walk through the topics on the agenda at this year’s Cop28 in Dubai Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition
Body


Good morning.
This year is set to be the hottest on record  and in the last 12 months a series of extreme weather events have caused devastation. There were record-breaking heatwaves  that swept the planet, severe flooding, and wildfires that raged for weeks in Greece.  This is a critical moment for climate action.
It is in this context that Cop28 – the 28th annual UN climate conference – begins in Dubai today. Representatives from more than 200 countries have been invited to the United Arab Emirates to create a plan to hasten the transition away from fossil fuels. Also under discussion will be the first global stocktake: the key mechanism to track global progress on the greenhouse gas emissions cuts needed to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. 
The summit has already been mired in controversy because the host country, the UAE, is the world’s seventh-largest oil producer with the fifth-largest gas reserves  and has appointed as president of Cop28  the chief executive of Adnoc, the national oil company. Activists, campaign groups and politicians have heavily criticised the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber , saying it represents a gross conflict of interest. Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at the charity ActionAid, said: “This appointment goes beyond putting the fox in charge of the hen house.” French MEP Manon Aubry called it “an absolute scandal”.
Today’s newsletter will take you through the agenda for Cop28 and what could be achieved in the next fortnight. That’s right after the headlines.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            Henry Kissinger | The secretary of state to Richard Nixon and eminence grise of world affairs has died aged 100. A giant of the Republican party, Kissinger remained influential until the end of his life , in large part thanks to his founding in 1982 of Kissinger Associates, a geopolitical consulting firm based in New York City, and the authorship of several books on international affairs. The firm announced  his death in a statement on Wednesday evening.
                                            Israel-Hamas war latest | Israel’s military has said this morning that a truce with Hamas will continue into a seventh day , as mediators continued to work towards further exchanges of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinians prisoners of Israel.
                                            Nottingham | Nottingham city council has issued a section 114 notice , in effect declaring itself bankrupt, as experts warn an increasing number of councils are “reaching breaking point”. In an announcement on Wednesday, the local authority said it had a significant gap in its budget and the council’s chief financial officer had decided it was not able to produce a balanced budget for this year.
                                            NHS  | The health service in England has been accused of “breaking the law” by creating a massive data platform that will share information about patients.  NHS England sparked controversy last week when it handed a £330m contract to establish and operate the “Federated Data Platform” for seven years from next spring to Palantir, the US spytech company.
                                            UK news | Four teenagers drowned after the vehicle they were travelling in left a road in north Wales, a coroner has said.  The inquests into the deaths of Jevon Hirst, 16, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Hugo Morris, 18, all from the Shropshire area, were opened and adjourned on Wednesday.
                   In depth: No-shows, fierce controversy and a climate summit in an oil-rich state – inside Cop28                   
Holding climate talks in a country that has missed its own clean power target has raised eyebrows, but others have said it’s important to involve as many countries as possible to hold them to account. Either way, the next 14 days will be full of fights and squabbles in the hopes of coming up with a fair plan to keep the planet safe.
***
                     What’s on the agenda?                   
The central agenda item will be the global stocktake, which is a fundamental part of the Paris agreement. The stocktake is effectively a reality check for delegates who need to monitor implementation of the agreement and the progress of all signatories. The UN has written that the introduction of the stocktake represents a “ critical turning point  ” in the effort to tackle the climate crisis. So far it is clear that everyone is significantly lagging behind the targets set in 2015.
Negotiators are expecting to clash over the loss and damage fund  – a euphemistic way of referring to the compensation allocated to poorer countries to deal with the devastating effects of the climate crisis that they disproportionately shoulder. As Fiona Harvey has written, the fund has been a “vexed” topic at previous Cops, but last year there was finally a breakthrough on the issue, when richer countries agreed that a fund could be set up to disburse cash.
At Cop28, negotiators must find a way to make that commitment a reality. There will be a lot of discussion about climate finance more broadly, but these negotiations will likely also be fraught. Funds will be squeezed as many industrialised and richer countries are giving significant levels of aid to Ukraine and Israel to support them through their respective conflicts.
There will probably also be disagreements about the language and timeline associated with moving away from fossil fuel use. Campaigners and certain countries are pushing to include language on “phasing out” fossil fuels. The motivation behind clarifying the language is to fast-track the move to clean energy sources and “slash” greenhouse gas emissions before 2030. Others are advocating for weaker language on “phasing down” fossil fuels or otherwise limiting the scope of transition away from fossil fuels.
A lot of the language around Cop28 can be fairly impenetrable, so I recommend reading Fiona Harvey’s jargon buster  on the most common terms and what they mean.
***
                     The no-shows                   
Joe Biden and Xi Jinping are skipping the two-week event. The US president, who is dealing with a slew of political challenges, has sent special climate envoy John Kerry to push the US agenda, and China’s climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, is expected there in lieu of the Chinese president.
The absence of the heads of state of the world’s two largest economies is likely to draw criticism from countries of the global south. In reality, Biden and Xi begging off will not make much of a difference from a climate policy perspective. The two leaders did announce a surprise agreement  this month to “triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030” in order to accelerate the replacement fossil fuels and reduce emissions sharply. The agreement has boosted ambition at the summit as a standard has now been set by two of the biggest polluters in the world.
***
                     The stakes                   
Temperatures are already 1.1-1.2C above pre-industrial levels and scientists have warned that we are much closer to missing the 1.5C climate target than previously thought. Independent monitor Climate Action Tracker predicts that, based on the current global commitments made to cut emissions, global temperatures will rise by 2.7C.  Billions of people would be affected and forced to live in conditions that include “extreme disruption, morbidity and death through heat shock, water stress, crop failure and the spread of infectious disease”, George Monbiot  writes. Course correcting  is the highest priority for many delegates, because even though a 1.5C rise in temperature will still cause problems, the impact will be far less extreme.
                     To                     stay up to date with all the latest news coming out of Dubai, keep a close eye on the Guardian’s coverage of the summit  over the next two weeks.

Arsenal romped into the last 16 as Kai Havertz sparked a six-goal demolition of Lens.  Erik ten Hag bemoaned the number of goals Manchester United have conceded in the Champions League this season but refused to lay the blame at the door of the goalkeeper, André Onana, despite his two errors that cost victory in the 3-3 draw against Galatasaray. 
                       Football | Two-thirds of players at this year’s Women’s World Cup (above) feel they were not at their physical peak during the tournament and a similar number have criticised the lack of recovery time  after it, with one describing their quick return to club football as “mentally exhausting”.
                       Rugby | England captain Owen Farrell will not be available for this season’s Six Nations Championship after deciding to take a break  from international rugby. In a statement, Farrell’s club Saracens said his decision had been made “in order to prioritise his and his family’s mental wellbeing”.

“Air pollution from fossil fuels kills 5m people a year” – our Guardian print splash this morning. “UK pensions triple lock under threat from 2025” says the i  while the Metro has “No change, no excuse”, which is about social media companies still targeting children with harmful content. The Financial Times leads with “US accuses Indian official of plotting to kill Sikh separatist in New York”. “Nightmare at A&E” – the Daily Mirror has an “NHS crisis exclusive” saying 54% of casualty units are rated as failing. “Hostage baby died in Gaza, Hamas claims” – that’s the Daily Telegraph, while the Daily Express version is “Smile of an innocent ‘lost’ in a war with no end”. “Migrant deal delays ‘put Rwandan help at risk’” is the warning from “senior diplomats” in the Times. And in the Daily Mail, more on currently the most famous author you’d probably never heard of before: “Outrage as royals in Scobie book race row named on TV”.

The sonnet, called We See You, is “an ode to every woman from the pitch to the boardroom, the communities and grassroots who are helping to level the playing field”, said Duffy, who grew up in a footballing family and was poet laureate from 2009 to 2019.
The poem, composed for the WeSeeYou Network, honours “a rich history of triumphant trailblazers” – from Mary Phillip, the first black player to captain and England women’s international team – to Pat Dunn, one of the first women to qualify as a football referee. “Red card for misogyny. Free kick in progress. We’re all onside,” Duffy writes.
The sonnet was composed for the WeSeeYouNetwork, which offers mentoring and training for women in sport. It concludes:
                       We’ll find you – 10 years old, girl with ball, incredible to be you. So here’s our Team Talk: We’re right behind you. And we see you.

                                                                                        Israel was “gradually moving ahead according to plan” in the Gaza Strip, chief military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said during a regular press briefing on Monday.  The Israeli air force said it had struck 600 targets in the last day.                                                                                          Israeli forces also struck targets in Syria and Lebanon, in response to launches from those areas into Israel , the country’s defence force has said. 
In separate tweets, the IDF said an aircraft had attacked Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory, including “infrastructures for directing terrorism and military infrastructures of the organisation”, and that a fighter jet had attacked launchers in Syrian territory.                                                                                          Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry has issued updated casualty figures, claiming that since Israel began its strikes on 7 October it has killed 8,306 Palestinians, including 3,457 children.  Israel began its latest military campaign after the Hamas attack inside Israel on 7 October which killed more than 1,400 Israelis.                                                                                          Shani Louk, a German-Israeli who was captured from a music festival in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas, has been confirmed dead by Israel’s foreign ministry.  In Germany, the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted her mother saying that her daughter’s body had not yet been found but a splinter of a skull bone had been found and a DNA sample taken that had led to the identification. A widely-seen video from 7 October had shown Louk lifeless in the back of a truck.                                                                                          Israel said it carried out an operation to “thwart terrorist infrastructure in the Jenin refugee camp” in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which it claimed led to 51 people being arrested, of which it claimed 38 were operatives of Hamas.                                                                                          International criminal court prosecutor Karim Khan said the ICC has “active investigations ongoing” into alleged war crimes in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.  The prosecutor added: “There should not be any impediment to humanitarian relief supplies going to … civilians.”                                                                                          Another 33 aid trucks were allowed to pass into Gaza  from Egypt on Sunday, according to a spokesperson at the Rafah crossing. It is the largest number of aid trucks to cross in a day since the conflict began, but humanitarian workers have told the Associated Press that the assistance still falls desperately short of what’s needed.                                                                                          The Kremlin has said that the mob that stormed a Dagestan airport in search of Jewish passengers from Israel on Sunday did so due to “outside influence”.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said “ill-wishers” had used widely seen images of suffering in Gaza to stir up people in the predominantly Muslim region in the north Caucasus. Local health authorities said 20 people had been injured in the incident in Makhachkala. Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will hold a meeting on Monday which the Kremlin said was to “discuss the west’s attempts to use events in the Middle East to split Russian society”.                                                                                          South Africa called for the UN to deploy a rapid protection force to protect civilians in the Gaza Strip from further bombardment.                                                                                          UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said on Monday his country was working on a humanitarian pause to get aid to the people of Gaza. “We’re working extensively with the Egyptians, with the Israelis and others to try and have a humanitarian pause, a temporary pause so that we can get that humanitarian aid to the people that need it,” he said during a visit to Abu Dhabi.                                                                                          France ’s interior ministry said this weekend that 719 antisemitic acts had been recorded in the three weeks since 7 October, the date of the Hamas attacks on Israel, compared to 436 for the whole of 2022.                                                                                          An emergency meeting of the UN security council requested by the United Arab Emirates will be held on Monday  as the council’s Arab representative seeks a binding resolution demanding that Israel accepts a humanitarian pause to the fighting in Gaza.                                                                                          The Palestinian Authority will not return to governing Gaza after the Israel-Hamas conflict without a comprehensive agreement that includes the West Bank in a Palestinian state, the authority’s prime minister has said.  Israeli civilian and military officials have said their plan for the end of the Gaza  war is to have some form of transitional authority rule the territory, perhaps involving Arab states.                                                                                          Israel has summoned the Russian ambassador to lodge a protest at Moscow’s hosting last week of a delegation from Hamas after its 7 October attacks against Israel.   Inviting Hamas  “sends a message legitimising terrorism against Israelis”, Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement, quoting its senior staff as telling ambassador Anatoly Viktorov.                                                                                          Joe Biden spoke by phone with Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday morning, the White House said.  “The president reiterated that Israel has every right and responsibility to defend its citizens from terrorism and underscored the need to do so in a manner consistent with international humanitarian law that prioritizes the protection of civilians,” the White House said in a press statement.                                                                                          Biden also spoke with Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the White House said. “President Biden and President Sisi affirmed their commitment to work together to set the conditions for a durable and sustainable peace in the Middle East to include the establishment of a Palestinian state,” it said.                                                                                          Thousands of Gaza  residents broke into UN warehouses on Sunday, grabbing flour and other essential items in a sign they had reached “breaking point” , said the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA).  “This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza,” UNRWA said in a statement.                                                                                          The number of children killed in Gaza in the last three weeks surpassed the annual number of children killed in war zones since 2019, Save the Children said on Sunday.  “With a further 1,000 children reported missing in Gaza assumed buried under the rubble, the death toll is likely much higher,” it added.

                                                                                        Hamas on Sunday said it is suspending hostage negotiations because of Israel’s handling of the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, a Palestinian official briefed on the hostage talks has told Reuters.  Israel’s three major TV news channels, without citing named sources, had reported there was some progress toward a deal, which would involve 50 to 100 women, children and elderly being released in stages during a three- to five-day pause in fighting.                                                                                          The World Health Organization has managed to get in touch with healthcare workers at Gaza’s al                         -Shifa hospital where thousands of Palestinians, including those who are critically injured                         , are sheltering as the Israeli military encircles the hospital.  In a statement on Sunday, the WHO chief, Tedros Ghebreyesus, called the situation “dire and perilous”.                                                                                          Regional directors of Unicef, UN Population Fund and the World Health Organization are calling for “immediate action to halt attacks on healthcare in Gaza                         ”.  They added: “ Attacks on medical facilities and civilians are unacceptable and are a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and conventions … The right to seek medical assistance, especially in times of crisis, should never be denied.”                                                                                          State-run Israel  Aerospace Industries (IAI) has signed a $1.2bn deal to supply air defense systems to Israel’s military, the company said on Sunday, citing the country’s war                         in Gaza, Reuters reports. 
 “IAI finds itself in an accelerated mode to supply systems and solutions for Israel’s defense establishment, for all theaters of operation, whether sea, ground, air or space,” IAI said, noting the deal was with the defense ministry.                                                                                          The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the US does not believe Israel  intends to re-occupy Gaza after its ongoing war with Hamas.  “This is not our understanding of the Israel government’s position,” said Sullivan, his words in apparent contrast to the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who separately told CNN, “The first thing we … will do … [is] destroy Hamas. The second thing we have to understand is that there has to be an overriding and overreaching Israeli military envelope.”                                                                                          An Israel military spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, said plans to try to evacuate babies from the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza were still being “developed                         ”. On Saturday Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said “We will provide the assistance needed” to remove the babies from the hospital.                                                                                          The Palestine Red Crescent Society announced Sunday that the al-Quds hospital in the Gaza Strip is “out of service and no longer operational”. It states that “the cessation of services is due to the depletion of available fuel and power outage”.                                                                                          The                          health authority in Gaza has said it is unable to issue updated casualty statistics in the Gaza Strip “due to the targeting of hospitals                         ”.                                                                                                                 Egyptian security sources told Reuters that on Sunday at least seven injured Palestinians arrived on Egyptian soil through the Rafah border crossing, and that 32 Egyptians crossed over, alongside 80 foreign nationals and dependents.  Russians and Poles were among those said to have crossed. Egyptian security sources also told the news agency that at least 80 aid trucks had moved from Egypt into Gaza by Sunday afternoon.                                                                                          The head of Lebanon’s Hezbollah party said its armed wing had used new types of weapons and struck new targets in Israel, and pledged that the front against its sworn enemy would remain active. In a televised address, only his second speech since the conflict between Israel and Hamas began in October, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah had shown “a quantitative improvement in the number of operations, the size and the number of targets, as well as an increase in the type of weapons”.                                                                                          The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, warned Hezbollah not to escalate fighting along the boundary.  “Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a war that might happen,” Gallant told troops in a video aired by Israeli television channels.

Young, bright, Palestinian: the three friends shot in Vermont

Highlight: Tahseen Ali Ahmad, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Hisham Awartani, all 20, are childhood friends and ‘incredibly tight’ – especially now
Body


In Ramallah, in the West Bank, in the spring of 2021, three school friends huddled round their computer screens.
Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad had all applied to study at American universities. Responses from the colleges tended to come through by email, usually between midnight and 2am Palestinian time.
The 18-year-old Palestinians, who had been friends since they were small children, spent that period video-chatting. As each  one opened his  email – “yes, you have been accepted”; “sorry,  your application has been denied” – he had two friends there for support.
Eventually, they were able to celebrate: all three earned places at universities, in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island. After a horrific shooting over the weekend, Awartani, Abdalhamid and Ali Ahmad have had to offer each other a different kind of support.
The three friends, all now 20 years old, were on their way to Thanksgiving dinner at Awartani’s grandmother’s house in Burlington, Vermont, when a white man fired at them with a handgun. One of the bullets struck Awartani’s spine, and he may not walk again.
Jason J Eaton, 48, was arrested on Sunday afternoon  and charged with attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty.
Police are investigating whether to charge Eaton with a hate crime; Burlington police say the three men had been speaking Arabic, and two had been wearing keffiyehs. The shooting has fuelled anxiety about the rise in violence against Muslim and Arab people in the US, which has also seen an increase in antisemitic incidents.
In the aftermath of the shooting, as the three were treated in hospital, there was some comfort in having each other there.
Awartani and Abdalhamid have been friends since they were babies. “They were forced to be friends,” Awartani’s mother, Elizabeth Price, said, noting that their parents had been close. Ali Ahmad, who is keeping a low profile in the media as he recovers, has been part of the trio for almost as long, since  joining the two at the Ramallah Friends School, where all three  excelled.
“They’re incredibly tight,” Price said.
“I would say that they are brothers. And when they got shot, the hospital very kindly put all of them in one ICU room, and I think that was very instrumental in helping them to deal with the trauma of the experience.
“They were teasing each other, and talking to each other. My mother slept there that first night and she said it was like a sleepover.”
Price, a US citizen who has lived in the West Bank for 25 years, arrived in Burlington on Wednesday, having traveled from Ramallah to Jordan before flying to the US.
Awartani and Abdalhamid, who suffered the worst injuries, are in a lot of pain, Price said. Awartani has been left “potentially paralysed” by the shooting; he has feeling in his legs – a good sign, Price said – but cannot move them.
Still, the 20-year-old has “been joking around” in recent days. His grandmother had recently bought him a Cardiff rugby shirt – Price’s family has links to Wales – and Awartani was quick to tell her that at least he hadn’t been wearing the shirt when he was shot.
“He’s got a wicked sense of humor, which will stand him in good stead,” Price said.
“Palestinians have had to struggle for 75 years in very difficult circumstances, and resilience is bred into these boys.”
Awartani had been shot before: when he was a teenager in Palestine, the Israeli military shot him with a rubber bullet during a protest against Israel’s occupation. He has been studying at Brown University, a prestigious Ivy League college set on a leafy campus in Providence, for the past two years. He is working toward two degrees, in pure mathematics and archaeology, his mother said, and prior to Saturday, was planning work on an archaeological dig in Italy.
If all had gone to plan, Awartani would have  seen his 13-year-old brother and 17-year-old sister later this month. He had been aiming to return to Ramallah for Christmas, although his father had concerns.
“??My husband really didn’t want Hisham to come back,” Price said.
“Traveling on West Bank roads is very dangerous, so my husband did not want to expose Hisham to being hurt on the way back to Ramallah.”
While  Ramallah has been relatively safe since the Israel-Hamas war broke out in November, that’s not so for  other parts of the West Bank. On Wednesday two boys, Adam Samer al-Ghoul, eight, and Basil Suleiman Abu al-Wafa, 15, were killed by Israeli Defense Forces  in the city of Jenin. About 200 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since Hamas’s rampage in southern Israel on 7 October, which killed about 1,200 people. The IDF’s retaliatory attacks on Gaza to the south have so far killed almost 15,000 people , including more than 6,000 children.
“Now he’s not coming back,” Price said. “He’s not coming back for a while.”
Awartani faces months of recovery. A written statement he provided after the shooting contained signs of his sense of humor.
“Who knew that all I had to do to become famous was to get shot?” Awartani said in the statement, which was read out loud at a vigil at Brown by Beshara Doumani, a professor of Palestinian studies at the school.
In the statement, Awartani urged students to view what happened to him as part of a much broader context.  
“I am but one casualty in this much wider conflict. Had I been shot in the West Bank where I grew up, the medical services which saved my life here would likely have been withheld by the Israeli army. The soldier who would have shot me would go home and never be convicted,” Awartani said.
“This is why when you send your wishes and later, candles for me today, your mind should not just be focused on me as an individual, but rather as a proud member of the people being oppressed.”
                                        ‘He framed the Palestinian condition beautifully’                                      
Aboud Ashhab, 20, went to school with Awartani in the West Bank. Both ended up at Brown.
Ashhab would call Awartani “Wikipedia” for the depth of his general knowledge. (“He’s like a kid in a candy store at Brown,” Price said of Awartani. “He’s studied Aramaic, he’s done Persian, he’s doing Italian, he was learning Spanish for a while, as well as doing graduate-level math courses, topology and algebra. ??I think for him going to college is just exhilarating.”)
But  Awartani and Ashhab don’t spend all their time studying. Awartani is a keen follower of Brighton and Hove Albion FC, the English football team, and is a “bit of a chef”, Ashhab said. Earlier this year he invited an intimidatingly large number of people over to their shared apartment for a mid-Ramadan feast.
“We spent hours cooking,” Ashhab said. “We made so much. Hisham cooks a lot of Arab and Palestinian food. He also makes his own kefir yoghurt, we made baba ganoush … ”
Ashhab and Awartani both protested against Israeli strikes on Gaza in 2021, which is when Awartani was shot by a rubber bullet, Ashhab said, in a grim echo of what would happen in Vermont two years later.
Both are also active in campus politics. They are members of the Brown Students for Justice in Palestine, and have spoken up against Brown University’s response to Israel’s actions in Gaza. In October, Ashhab, Awartani and several other  students attended a meeting with university administrators to demand better protection for Arab students, and to ask the school to denounce Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza.
The university’s response remains a source of frustration.
“It took a Palestinian being shot to actually have some acknowledgement of what we’re going through from the university administration,” said Sherena Razek, a Palestinian-Canadian and a PhD candidate at Brown, who was part of the meeting with Brown higher-ups.
Razek first met Awartani when he spoke at a vigil at Brown, held for lives lost in Gaza.
“He was a profound speaker, his words really resonated with me. He shared a personal story. It’s also very upsetting to have heard Hisham share a personal story about having been targeted and shot by the Israeli military during a protest with a rubber bullet in his leg, and to see that these bullets followed him here to America,” Razek said.
“But he just framed the Palestinian condition so beautifully. He has very young bright energy.”
Since 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel, and Israel responded with an unprecedented bombardment that has killed thousands and forced 1.8 million people to flee their homes, hate crimes against Muslim, Arab and Jewish communities have spiked, according to the FBI.
The charged climate in the US, and the government’s vocal support of Israel’s military campaign, have led many to fear for their safety, including Inteemum Ahsan, a friend of Abdalhamid at Haverford College.
“As a brown Muslim student from Bangladesh, I am terrified,” Ahsan said.
“Being reminded of the threat of violence and hate by the attack on Kinnan this weekend is horrifying and heartbreaking.”
Ahsan, 21, has been friends with Abdalhamid since the latter arrived at Haverford, about 10 miles north-west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
“He’s a warm, energetic person. He is a caring friend, and an impactful community member,” Ahsan said.
Abdalhamid, who holds US citizenship, was released from hospital on Thursday. A pre-med student at Haverford, he’s described as “something of a science genius” by Micah, a close friend who asked that his real name not be used, adding: “We love to jump around singing our favorite hip-hop lyrics completely carefree.”
In addition to listening to music, Micah and Abdalhamid lift weights together, Micah said, where they “are constantly competing”. (Micah did not say who could lift more.) Abdalhamid, a talented runner, is a member of the men’s track and field team.
The shooting has left friends and family of the three men confused, angry and sometimes scared.
“I felt so sad, angry and shocked,” Micah said. “I also felt a sense of guilt. Kinnan, a US citizen, came to America seeking an education, and this is how we treat him? I also began to think about how desensitized even I am, a Black American man, to hateful violence.”
“For the past two months, I have been reading in the news every day about Israel’s bombing and killing of Palestinians in Gaza... it’s easy to forget that each one of them is loved and supported by a big network of friends and family, just like Kinnan is.”

Highlight: About 100 jets involved in heavy bombardment as Palestinians report clashes in north-east and central strip Israel and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


The Israel Defence Forces have said they struck 150 underground Hamas targets in Gaza overnight in the heaviest aerial bombardment of the Gaza war so far, as Palestinian residents of the territory reported clashes with Israeli armoured vehicles and infantry overnight.
According to the IDF, about 100 Israeli jets were involved in the strikes which began in earnest after dusk on Friday.
Video footage released by the IDF on Saturday morning showed columns of tanks crossing a flat and open sandy area of Gaza, firing on built up areas in the distance.

Unlike the previous larger-scale raids that have occurred in recent nights from which Israeli forces withdraw, officials said armour and infantry remained in Gaza on Saturday morning.
“The forces are still on the ground and are continuing the war,” said an IDF spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, without elaborating.
The intensification of the fighting prompted alarm among families of the 229 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum demanded an immediate meeting with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and members of the war cabinet.
In a statement, the group said: “This night was the worst of all nights. Anxiety, frustration, and especially enormous anger that no one from the war cabinet bothered to meet with the families of the abductees to explain to them one thing – whether the ground operation endangers the safety of the 229 abductees in Gaza.”
With internet and mobile services almost entirely cut off  in Gaza from Friday evening, information about the situation in the Hamas-ruled coastal strip of 2.3 million people was scant. Footage from media-camera positions just outside Gaza in Israel and Egypt showed a night of endless airstrikes and artillery colouring the night sky orange.
By Saturday morning Gaza was enfolded in dense fog. Detonations could be heard in the territory intermittently.
An IDF spokesperson said the airstrikes involving 100 Israeli jets hit combat tunnels, underground combat areas and underground terrorist infrastructure. 
The handful of reports to emerge from inside Gaza described a chaotic situation, with paramedic teams struggling to coordinate the recovery of the dead and injured because of the lack of communications.
A journalist working for the BBC in Gaza described “total chaos” during the night of strikes and in its aftermath.
“There was a huge bombardment in the north of Gaza Strip on a scale we’ve never seen before,” wrote Rushdi Abualouf.
“At the hospital here, ambulance drivers told me they couldn’t communicate with anyone, so they were just driving in the direction of the explosions.
“There’s been panic everywhere – even here in Khan Younis where the bombing was less – as people try to reach family members in other areas to check they are safe, but the phones have been cut off.”
The armed wing of Hamas said late on Friday its fighters were clashing with Israeli troops in Gaza’s north-eastern town of Beit Hanoun and in the central area of Bureij.
“Netanyahu and his defeated army will not be able to achieve any military victory,” Hamas said in a statement early on Saturday.
The UN general assembly overwhelmingly called for an immediate and sustainable humanitarian truce  in Gaza late on Friday. The non-binding vote passed with 120 in favour, while 45 abstained and 14 – including Israel and the US – voted against.
Earlier on Friday, the UN said basic services in Gaza had crumbled, leaving people exposed to major outbreaks of disease as the streets overflowed with sewage, and food, water and medicine ran out.
According to reports from Gaza residents, the heaviest clashes appeared to be taking place in the northern area of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, while clashes were also reported east of the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, and east of the southern city of Khan Younis, although it was unclear on what scale. All areas have been used as approach routes for Israeli incursions in the past.
The strikes on the extensive Hamas tunnel system, known colloquially to Israeli military planners as the “metro”, comes after the released hostage Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, said she and other captives were taken deep inside the tunnels during her captivity.
Explosions from continuous airstrikes lit up the sky over Gaza City for hours after nightfall on Friday.
The Palestinian telecom provider, Paltel, said the bombardment caused “complete disruption” of internet, cellular and landline services. This meant that casualties from strikes and details of ground incursions could not immediately be known. Some satellite phones continued to function.
Already plunged into darkness after most electricity was cut off weeks ago, Palestinians were isolated further, huddling in homes and shelters , with food and water supplies running out. Attempts to reach Gaza residents by phone were largely unsuccessful early on Saturday.
Relatives outside Gaza panicked after their messaging chats with families inside suddenly went dead and phone calls stopped going through.
Wafaa Abdul Rahman, the director of a feminist organisation based in the West Bank city of Ramallah, said she had not heard for hours from family in central Gaza. “We’ve been seeing these horrible things and massacres when it’s live on TV, so now what will happen when there’s a total blackout?” she asked, referring to scenes of families that have been crushed in their homes by airstrikes over recent weeks.
The Israeli military spokesperson R Adm Hagari said ground forces were “expanding their activity” on Friday evening in Gaza and “acting with great force … to achieve the objectives of the war”. Israel says its strikes target Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate from among civilians, putting them in danger.
The Hamas media centre reported heavy nighttime clashes with Israeli forces at several places, including what it said was an Israeli incursion east of the Bureij refugee camp.
Asked about the report, the Israeli military reiterated on Saturday that it had been carrying out targeted raids and expanding strikes with the aim of “preparing the ground for future stages of the operation”.
Israel has amassed hundreds of thousands of troops along the border ahead of an expected ground offensive. Since mid-week , the military has reported nightly hours-long raids by ground forces into Gaza, saying troops have struck Hamas targets with the aim of preparing the battlefield.
Gallant said Israel expected to launch a long and difficult ground offensive into Gaza soon. It “will take a long time” to dismantle Hamas’s vast network of tunnels, he said, adding that he expected there to be a lengthy phase of lower-intensity fighting as Israel destroyed “pockets of resistance”.
His comments pointed to a potentially gruelling and open-ended new phase of the war after three weeks of relentless bombardment.
Israel has said it aims to crush Hamas’s rule in Gaza  and its ability to threaten Israel. How Hamas’s defeat will be measured, and what an invasion’s endgame will look like remain unclear. Israel says it does not intend to rule the territory but does not say who it expects to do so.
In Washington, the Pentagon said the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke with Gallant on Friday and “underscored the importance of protecting civilians during the Israel Defence Forces’ operations and focusing on the urgency of humanitarian aid delivery for civilians in Gaza”. The Pentagon said Austin also brought up “the need for Hamas to release all of the hostages”.
The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region. Arab nations – including US allies and ones that have reached peace deals or normalised ties with Israel – have raised increasing alarm over the potential ground invasion of Gaza, which is likely to increase casualties amid urban fighting.

Highlight: Lloyd Austin says president ‘will not tolerate attacks on US forces’, but Qatar warns that reprisal attacks could undermine Israel hostage talksSee all our Middle East coverage
Body


US defense secretary Lloyd Austin has vowed to take “all necessary actions” to defend US troops after Iran-backed militants killed three US troops  and wounded dozens more in a drone attack on a US base in Jordan.
“The president and I will not tolerate attacks on US forces and we will take all necessary actions to defend the US and our troops,” Austin said at the Pentagon on Monday.
The statement came as US officials told the Associated Press that the enemy drone – which also wounded dozens of people at the desert outpost in Jordan – may have been confused with an American drone returning to the US installation.
The Pentagon on Monday named the three troops killed in the attack  as army reservists Sgt William Jerome Rivers, Spc Breonna Alexsondria Moffett and Spc Kennedy Sanders.
The attack on Sunday was the first deadly strike against US troops since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October, and marks a major escalation in tensions that have engulfed the Middle East.
Qatar’s prime minister said on Monday he hoped any US retaliation would not undercut progress toward a new Israel-Hamas hostage release  deal in weekend talks.
“I hope that nothing would undermine the efforts that we are doing or jeopardise the process,” sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani said in Washington.
Al Thani, who attended the talks, said “good progress” had been made and the parties were “hoping to relay this proposal to Hamas and to get them to a place where they engage positively and constructively in the process”. US secretary of state Antony Blinken expressed hope for the deal, saying: “Very important, productive work has been done. And there is some real hope going forward.”
A senior Hamas official, Taher al-Nunu, said it wanted a “complete and comprehensive ceasefire, not a temporary truce”, although it was not immediately clear whether Hamas officials had received the Qatari text.
John Kirby, a spokesperson for the national security council at the White House, told CBS: “We are not interested in a broader conflict in the region, we’re not looking for another war, but we absolutely will do what we have to do to protect ourselves.”
President Joe Biden now faces a balancing act, blaming Iran and looking to strike back in a forceful way without causing any further escalation of the Gaza conflict. The White House said on Monday the president was “weighing his options” for a “very consequential” answer to the attack.
US Republicans have suggested they would use Iran as a test case of Biden’s strength ahead of the US elections. “The entire world now watches for signs that the president is finally prepared to exercise American strength,” Republican senate minority Leader Mitch McConnell said.
Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate judiciary committee and a leading hawk, urged Biden to “hit Iran now. Hit them hard.”
In describing the drone attack two US officials who were not authorised to comment and insisted on anonymity, said preliminary accounts suggest the enemy drone that struck the installation known as Tower 22  may have been mistaken for an American drone that was in the air at the same time.
The officials said that as the enemy drone was flying in at a low altitude, a US drone was returning to the base. As a result, there was no effort to shoot down the enemy drone.
The attack, which the Biden administration blames on Iranian-based proxies, adds another layer of complexity to an already tense Middle East situation  as the Biden administration tries to keep the Israel-Hamas war from expanding into a broader regional conflict.
The targeted base, known as Tower 22, sits near the demilitarized zone on the border between Jordan and Syria along a sandy, bulldozed berm marking the DMZ’s southern edge. The Iraqi border is only 10km (6 miles) away.
The area is known as Rukban, a vast arid region that once saw a refugee camp spring up on the Syrian side over the rise of the Islamic State group’s so-called caliphate in 2014.
The base’s location offers a site for US forces to infiltrate and quietly leave Syria.
US troops long have used Jordan, a kingdom bordering Iraq, Israel, the West Bank, Saudi Arabia and Syria, as a basing point. Some 3,000 American troops typically are stationed across Jordan.
However, the US presence in Jordan risks angering a population that has already held mass demonstrations against Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza over civilian casualties in a conflict that has already killed over 26,000 Palestinians.
                     Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report

Highlight: Displaced families prepare to spend holy month in Rafah amid food shortages and fear of attackMiddle East crisis – live updates
Body


Seventy days after they were forced to leave their house in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, Hanaa al-Masry, her husband and their six children are preparing for Ramadan in their new home: a dilapidated tent. Here, there will be no decorations, no joyous family meals and no reading of the Qur’an under the lemon and orange trees in the garden.
The Muslim holy month – a time for friends and family as well as religious contemplation, prayer and fasting – starts on Monday and will be like none that anyone in Gaza can remember.
The Masry family fled Khan Younis after receiving leaflets from the Israeli military telling them to relocate for their own safety. They made their way to the city of Rafah on the border with Egypt and now live in a crowded makeshift camp, sleeping and eating amid a jumble of salvaged possessions.
“My daughters used to carefully save their money to buy decorations and every year I would chose a new Ramadan lantern,” Hanaa al-Masry, 37, said. “It is very depressing, very difficult.”
This year, there will be no lanterns. Masry will prepare neither suhoor, the meal taken before the start of the ritual day-long fast, nor iftar at its end.
It saddens her: “I used to love preparing a meal of cheese, jam, beans and eggs to sustain my family throughout the fast and then something tasty for iftar.”
Conditions in Rafah are better than in the north of territory, where local health officials say 20 deaths by starvation have been recorded , but basics are still in short supply. Many are surviving on flatbread cooked over wood fires or basic gas hobs, and tinned goods trucked in by humanitarian agencies from Egypt. Half a kilo of sugar now costs $10 and salt is almost unobtainable. Fresh fruit or vegetables are rare and very expensive.
“I am not the only one yearning to uphold our customs. My neighbours and I used to adorn our street with lights and lanterns, but now everything around us is bleak. The streets bear the scars of Israeli bombings, and the community is in mourning,” said al-Masry.
The war was triggered in October when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting 250 more , of whom about half were freed in a short-lived truce in November.
More than 31,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli offensive launched after the Hamas attack, most of them women and children, according to officials in the territory. Much of it has been reduced to rubble.
Israel blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the militant organisation, which has run Gaza since 2007, uses civilians as human shields. Hamas denies the charge.
Hussein al-Awda, 37, arrived in Rafah more than a month ago after spending much of the war in a UN-run shelter near Khan Younis. A programme officer with an international NGO, he has barely eaten meat since the conflict began, and recently has been surviving on tinned beans.
“There are some nuts and dried fruits in the market, the sort of thing we would have to break our fast in Ramadan, but they are just so expensive. Iftar will just be more beans,” Awda said.
Electricity was cut off by Israel at the beginning of the conflict, most of the sanitation and power infrastructure has been destroyed and the minimal amounts of fuel allowed into the territory are insufficient for running pumps or generators. Everywhere, donkey carts  have replaced cars as the principal mode of transport.
Awda, whose house in Gaza City was destroyed in the first weeks of the war, spent all his savings on getting his wife and three young children to Cairo last month. He stayed to look after his elderly and unwell parents, who are too frail to travel.
“We’ve always been together for Ramadan. To be split up like this … I don’t know how to explain it to my children. My youngest is beginning to talk and I can only hear him on my phone if I can find some internet connection but even that is very hard,” he said.
Alaa al-Shurafa, a lecturer at the Islamic University, was told by the Israeli military to flee her home in Gaza City five months ago. Since then she has been living with her parents in a small room in an abandoned apartment block in Rafah.
Her family are scattered. One sister is in Gaza City, another is elsewhere in Rafah. “We are now isolated from our loved ones, uncertain of when we can return to our home in Gaza,” Shurafa said.
Looming over all those trying to celebrate Ramadan in Rafah is the prospect of an imminent attack. Israeli officials say Hamas leaders are based in the city along with four battalions of militants – the only major remaining fighting force of the Islamist organisation.
Though Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, pledged last week to continue to seek “total victory”, he is under intense international pressure to halt Israel’s military operations and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.
The prospect of a military assault in a city home to more than a million displaced people that is also a major logistics hub for aid operations has raised deep concerns. “We are just sitting here waiting for our fate … The hardest thing is we have no idea how long it will be like this,” said Awda.
Masry remembers watering the trees and roses in her garden in Khan Younis daily after the dawn prayer. “I used to find solace in sitting in my garden, reciting the Qur’an and offering prayers to God. Now, my garden lies in ruins.”

Highlight: The president has lost favor with young, Muslim and Arab Americans, important Democratic constituencies
Body


On Wednesday afternoon, hundreds of liberal Jewish American activists staged sit-ins in the Capitol Hill offices of top Democrats, including in the senate office of progressive champion Bernie Sanders, to demand a ceasefire in the escalating war between Israel and Hamas.
As they sang in Hebrew and prayed for peace, the House floor resumed legislative activity for the first time in weeks after the election of a new Republican speaker , congressman Mike Johnson.
In his first act, Johnson brought to the floor a resolution  declaring US solidarity with Israel after Hamas rampaged through Israeli cities, killing 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages, Americans among them. Nearly all House Democrats voted to approve the measure, save for a resolute minority  who dissented, citing its failure to address the thousands of Palestinians killed in Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign of Gaza.
The discontent on display in Washington was a testament to the rising anger among the party’s left over the response from Biden and Democratic leaders to Israel’s war in Gaza. But as many progressives split from the White House over the US’s staunchly pro-Israel stance, there were also splits within the left itself – a sign of the raw emotions stirred by the conflict.
Nor were the scenes in the House the only signs of discontent as US politics – and civil society as a whole – becomes increasingly roiled by Israel’s response to the 7 October Hamas attack.
That same afternoon, Joe Biden was asked about the rising Palestinian death toll during a news conference at the White House. Biden replied that he had “no confidence” in the death count provided by the Gaza health ministry, which says nearly 7,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began.
“I’m sure innocents have been killed, and it’s the price of waging a war,” Biden said, in comments the Council on American-Islamic Relations described as “ shocking and dehumanizing. ”
Online, many progressives seethed, accusing Biden of further enabling violence against Palestinians and predicting that he would pay an electoral price next year with Muslim and Arab American voters, who have emerged as an important Democratic constituency in recent elections.
“The White House and many in the US government are clear as they should be that 1,000 Israelis killed is too many,” said Eva Borgwardt, the political director of IfNotNow, a progressive Jewish group leading many of the demonstrations in Washington, including the one at the Capitol on Wednesday. “Our question for them is: How many Palestinian deaths are too many?”
As Israel intensifies its bombardment of Gaza, Biden is facing extraordinary and growing resistance from his party’s left flank, especially from young voters and voters of color, over his steadfast support for Israel. They have staged demonstrations, penned open letters and even tendered resignations  in protest of the Biden administration’s handling of a war they say is threatening the president’s standing at home and possibly his chances of winning re-election next year.
A Gallup poll  released on Thursday found that Biden’s approval rating among Democrats plummeted 11 percentage points in one month, to a record low of 75%. According to the survey, the drop was fueled by dismay among Democratic voters over Biden’s support for Israel.
Meanwhile, a poll  released last week by the progressive firm Data for Progress found that 66% of likely US voters strongly or somewhat agree that the US should call for a ceasefire.
Still, the White House has firmly rejected calls for a ceasefire, which Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, initially described as “repugnant” and “disgraceful” in the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack. The administration’s rhetoric has since evolved, with White House spokesperson John Kirby arguing this week that a ceasefire at this stage “only benefits Hamas”. Asked earlier this week whether the US would support a ceasefire, Biden said: “We should have those hostages released and then we can talk.”
Pressure is building in Congress, where 18 House Democrats – all progressive lawmakers of color – joined a resolution calling for the White House to support “an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel and occupied Palestine”.
On Capitol Hill, a group of Jewish and Muslim staffers  wrote an anonymous open letter to their bosses similarly calling for an “immediate ceasefire” between Israel and Hamas. Urging congressional leaders to act swiftly, they cited the rising death toll in Gaza and the rise of antisemitism, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian sentiments in the United States.
Meanwhile, hundreds of former campaign and congressional staffers to progressive senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , John Fetterman of Pennsylvania  and Bernie Sanders of Vermont , have penned open letters urging them to call for a ceasefire.
So far no senator has backed a ceasefire. Warren, Sanders and several other Democratic senators  have urged a “humanitarian pause” to allow aid, food and medical supplies to flow into Gaza after Israel ordered a “complete siege” of the territory. It echoes the position of the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who said earlier this week that it “must be considered” to protect civilian life.
Sanders’ resistance to back a ceasefire has disappointed  some of even his most loyal followers, in a sign of how emotionally fraught the debate over Israel has become on the left.
Though the 2024 presidential election is a year away, many progressives, and especially younger activists, have threatened to withhold support for Biden, while Arab and Muslim Americans have expressed deep alarm over the president’s actions and rhetoric.
Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the only Palestinian American in Congress, has accused Biden of abetting the deadly war. “We will remember where you stood,” she wrote  in a social media post tagging the president.
At his press conference on Wednesday, Biden also cautioned Israel to be “incredibly careful to ensure they’re going after the folks propagating this war”. For many on the left, the warning was buried behind his comments casting doubt on the scale of war deaths in Gaza.
“Like many progressive Democrats, I have applauded and been pleasantly surprised by President Biden’s actions on climate and the economy,” Waleed Shahid, a progressive strategist tracking the administration’s response to the war, wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “But he’s crossed a moral line with nearly every Muslim, Arab and anti-war young voter I know.”
The White House said on Thursday the Biden administration did not dispute that thousands of Palestinians had been killed and emphasized that the health ministry was run by Hamas.
Even a slight erosion in support could spell danger for Biden, who was already struggling with low enthusiasm, particularly among young voters.
In polling conducted after the Hamas attack, a Quinnipiac survey  found that slightly more than half of voters under 35 say they disapprove of the United States sending weapons and military support to Israel in the wake of the Hamas attack. By contrast, nearly six in 10 voters between the ages of 35 and 49 support sending weapons to Israel, with older age groups offering even stronger approval.
Biden’s allies have largely downplayed the disagreements among the party’s grassroots. They note that most Democrats, including the party’s congressional leaders, the senator Chuck Schumer and the congressman Hakeem Jeffries, are strong supporters of Israel and fully back the president’s handling of the conflict. In the coming weeks, their caucuses are expected to overwhelmingly support a White House request to send $14.3bn  in security aid to Israel.
A letter  to Biden, signed by ?a majority of House Democrats, including every Jewish? member ?of their caucus and several liberal members, praises his ?”strong leadership during a tragic and dangerous moment in the Middle East”.
It further commends Biden for displaying? “steadfast support for our ally Israel in a moment of need and horror” while ?also making “clear statements regarding the fundamental importance of ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the civilian population of Gaza are met”.
Deep, abiding support for Israel among Democrats on Capitol Hill obscures a shift among the party’s voters, and especially among those who came of age in a post-9/11 US. A Gallup poll conducted in March found for the first time  that a greater number of Democrats say they sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis.
Republicans have sought to exploit those divisions in an attempt to cast the Democratic party as anti-Israel, a narrative progressives say media coverage has unfairly promoted.
Many liberal Democrats, including the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have forcefully denounced  pro-Hamas or antisemitic sentiments expressed by the party’s activist fringe. At the same time, they contend that there is a double standard in the way elected officials speak about Palestinians.
They point to comments from Republicans like the senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who described the conflict as a “religious war” and said Israelis should “do whatever the hell you have to do to defend yourself. Level the place.”
Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, made a similar remark, saying in an interview: “As far as I’m concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza.”
“I have long found the ignoring and sidelining of Palestinians in the US House of Representatives, the humanity of Palestinian populations, in the five years I have been in Congress, quite shocking,” Ocasio-Cortez said  recently on MSNBC.
With expectations that a large-scale Israeli invasion of the besieged territory is imminent, demands for an immediate ceasefire have grown louder and more urgent.
In a statement on Friday, amid intensifying bombing and a communications blackout in Gaza , Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of the progressive group Justice Democrats, implored the president to act now to prevent a ground invasion that would “ensure thousands more civilian casualties, bring us closer to an all-out regional conflict in the Middle East, and thrust the United States into another endless war”.
Looking to the future, progressives say the administration must be prepared to dramatically reshape Washington’s decades-long approach to Israel and Palestine.
“If we want to take a consistent policy towards human rights, we cannot always be focused on supporting the rights and security of one side here,” said Matt Duss,  a former foreign policy adviser to Sanders.
“The status quo,” he said, “is clearly unsustainable.”

The principle of human dignity must apply to all people

Highlight: Adam Tooze, Samuel Moyn, Amia Srinivasan and others respond to a statement issued by German academics on the situation in Israel and Gaza. Report:Israel-Hamas war opens up German debate over meaning of ‘Never again’
Body


We the undersigned are deeply concerned by the statement  “Principles of solidarity” published on the website of the Normative Orders research centre at Goethe-Universität Frankfurt on 13 November 2023, signed by Nicole Deitelhoff, Rainer Forst, Klaus Günther and Jürgen Habermas.
We join the authors in condemning the killing and taking hostage of Israeli civilians by Hamas on 7 October 2023 and we fully agree with the vital need to protect Jewish life in Germany in the face of rising antisemitism. We also agree with the statement’s grounding of these positions in the respect for human dignity for all people as a central part of the “democratic ethos of the Federal Republic of Germany”.
However, we are deeply troubled by the apparent limits of the solidarity expressed by the authors. The statement’s concern for human dignity is not adequately extended to Palestinian civilians in Gaza who are facing death and destruction. Nor is it applied or extended to Muslims in Germany experiencing rising Islamophobia. Solidarity means that the principle of human dignity must apply to all people. This requires us to recognise and address the suffering of all those affected by an armed conflict.
The statement claims that “the standards of judgement slip completely when genocidal intentions are attributed to Israel’s actions”. There is ongoing discussion  among genocide scholars  and legal experts about whether the legal standard for genocide has been met. Human rights groups have filed lawsuits alleging genocide at the international criminal court  and a federal court  in the US. Omer Bartov , professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Brown University, has recently reminded us: “We know from history that it is crucial to warn of the potential for genocide before it occurs, rather than belatedly condemn it after it has taken place. I think we still have that time.” Showing solidarity and respecting human dignity means that we must heed this warning and not close down the space for debate and reflection about the possibility of genocide. Not all signatories believe that the legal standards for genocide have been met; nevertheless, all agree that this is a matter of legitimate debate.
The statement mentions three “guiding principles” for military action: “principles of proportionality, the prevention of civilian casualties and the waging of a war with the prospect for future peace”. We are concerned that there is no mention of upholding international law, which also prohibits war crimes and crimes against humanity such as collective punishment, persecution, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure including schools, hospitals and places of worship. Being guided by principles of international legal standards, solidarity and human dignity compels us to hold all participants in the conflict to this higher standard.
We cannot allow the atrocities to force us to abandon these principles.

Highlight: US secretary of state meets officials from Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar and UN as further civilian casualties reported in GazaFollow live for the latest in the Israel-Hamas war
Body


The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, met senior Jordanian and other Arab officials in Amman on Saturday in the latest effort by Washington to avert a regional escalation of the war between Israel and Hamas, ease the acute humanitarian crisis in Gaza and build support for planning a post-conflict future for the territory.
The trip was Blinken’s second to the Middle East since the conflict began almost a month ago but came against the backdrop of further civilian casualties in Gaza and an apparent snub from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Saturday, Palestinians reported a deadly Israeli strike on a UN-run school in northern Gaza serving as a shelter.
Witnesses said the strike hit al-Fakhoura school in Jabalia, where thousands of evacuees were living. At least 15 people died and dozens more were wounded, said the Gaza health ministry official Mohammad Abu Selmeyah.
Juliette Touma, the director of communication for the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA), confirmed to Reuters that the UN-run school had been hit.
She said there were children among the casualties, but that UNRWA had not yet been able to verify the exact death toll.
“At least one strike hit the schoolyard where there were tents for displaced families. Another strike hit inside the school where women were baking bread,” Touma said by phone.
There is no sign that Israel will ease its effort to “crush” Hamas in Gaza and Netanyahu has largely ignored Blinken’s blunt warning  that Israel risks losing any hope of an eventual peace deal with the Palestinians unless it eases the humanitarian crisis there.
The month-long war was triggered when Hamas militants launched a bloody raid across the border into Israel on 7 October, killing more than 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and taking 241 hostages.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says more than 9,220 people have been killed in Israeli bombardments since then, most of them children or women.
On Friday, Blinken had flown into Israel to urge Netanyahu to temporarily stop the military offensive  to allow aid into the territory, amid rising concerns over civilian casualties as the fighting intensifies.
US officials have said they hope a pause in the fighting will allow humanitarian aid to reach desperate civilians in Gaza and help negotiations to free the hostages seized by Hamas. 
However, after meeting Blinken in Tel Aviv on Friday, Netanyahu warned there could be no “temporary truce” in Gaza unless Hamas released the hostages.
Despite Netanyahu’s statement that the offensive in Gaza would continue “with full force”, a senior White House official said talks on a pause in fighting were ongoing.
In Jordan, Blinken first met Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, whose economically and politically ravaged country is home to Iran’s proxy militia Hezbollah. 
Clashes between Hezbollah and the Israeli military have flared along the border between the two countries in recent weeks, killing six Israeli soldiers and one civilian, and an estimated 50 fighters from the Islamist organisation. There are widespread concerns that the fighting could flare into a full-scale confrontation.
Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah , on Friday gave his first major speech since the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October, but did not commit his organisation to greater involvement in the current conflict.
Nasrallah stressed, however, that Hezbollah was not scared by a US deployment of two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean.
Blinken thanked Mikati for “preventing Lebanon from being pulled into a war that the Lebanese people do not want”, said state department spokesperson Matthew Miller. 
Later on Saturday, Blinken was to hold group talks with the foreign ministers of Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and the chair of the PLO executive committee. All parties have denounced Israel’s tactics against Hamas, which they say constitute unlawful collective punishment of the Palestinian people.
Arab states have thus far resisted American suggestions that they play a larger role in the latest Middle East crisis.
The group meeting with Blinken was convened by Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman al-Safadi, who said the gathering was organised “in the context of their efforts aimed at stopping the Israeli war on Gaza and the humanitarian catastrophe it is causing”, according to the ministry.
Egyptian officials said there was consensus among Arab governments involved in discussions with the US to resist “any talks” on the postwar period in Gaza before establishing a ceasefire and allowing the delivery of more humanitarian aid and fuel to Gaza.
They said Egypt, in coordination with Qatar, has proposed humanitarian pauses of fighting for six to 12 hours every day to permit aid deliveries, evacuations of seriously injured to Egypt and the entry of fuel. The United Nations would oversee the delivery of fuel to hospitals and other vital civilian infrastructure.
The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Washington was in constant dialogue with Israel, “asking hard questions” on points such as “the objectives you’re seeking, and an honest assessment of whether you’re achieving them”.
The Israeli military said it would enable Palestinians to travel on a main Gaza Strip highway on Saturday as part of its efforts to encourage civilians to evacuate southward away from areas that are the focus of its war with Hamas.
In a social media post in Arabic, the military said the Salah al-Din road could be used between 1pm and 4pm local time. “If you care about yourself and your loved ones, heed our instruction to head south,” it added.
Gaza has already suffered massive destruction, and now faces acute shortages of food, clean water and medicines. More than a third of hospitals are out of action and those remaining are overwhelmed by casualties.
On Friday evening, the health ministry reported that an airstrike had hit a convoy of ambulances outside Gaza’s largest hospital, killing 15 people and injuring 60 others.
The Israel  Defence Forces (IDF) said they carried out an airstrike on an ambulance they said was being used by Hamas, adding that “a number of Hamas terrorist operatives” were killed in the strike.
Earlier in Friday, an IDF spokesperson accused Hamas of using ambulances to transport “operatives”.
Hamas official Izzat El Reshiq said allegations its fighters were present were “baseless”. Ashraf al-Qidra, a spokesperson for Gaza’s health ministry, said the ambulance was part of a convoy that Israel targeted near Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital.
Pictures of the aftermath of Saturday’s strike on a school showed broken furniture and other belongings lying on the ground, patches of blood spilled on the ground and people crying.
“I was standing here when three bombings happened, I carried a body and another decapitated body with my own hands,” a young boy said in video obtained by Reuters, crying in despair. “God will take my vengeance.”
One man asked angrily: “Since when has it become normal to strike shelters? This is so unfair.”
“At least one strike hit the schoolyard where there were tents for displaced families. Another strike hit inside the school where women were baking bread,” said Touma of the UNRWA.
                     Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributes to this report

Highlight: Party’s position has shifted with Keir Starmer now calling for a ‘sustainable ceasefire’ but for some voters it is too little too lateExclusive: Labour acts on fears over Muslim vote
Body


At Walsall Central mosque, a redbrick building on a street of Victorian terraces in the West Midlands market town, the imam, Murthaza Qadri, has reflected on the changing views of his congregation over the past few months.
“There was never much talk about politics before but now everyone cares, lots of people are speaking up,” he said last week. “We’ve been brought up in an environment where we were blindly supporters of Labour, old and young. But now people are opening their eyes a bit more.”
The issue that has opened the eyes of Muslims in Walsall and elsewhere across the country is Labour’s failure to explicitly demand a permanent ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. The party’s position has shifted in recent weeks but, with more than 25,000 casualties in Gaza and a growing humanitarian catastrophe, it is too little and too late for many Muslims.
The anguish and anger felt by Muslims in the UK over the Israel-Gaza war could spell trouble for Labour at the next election. An opinion poll carried out in November by Savanta found  strong support for Labour among Muslim voters, with 64% backing the party. But more than 40% said Keir Starmer’s response to the war had made them less likely to vote Labour, while 20% said it had made them more likely to do so. One in three Muslim voters rated the conflict among their top three issues in deciding who to vote for.
In Ilford North, local activists have selected a candidate to challenge the 5,198 majority of the shadow health secretary Wes Streeting specifically on Labour’s position on the Gaza war. Nearly a quarter  of the population is Muslim.
In Walsall, where 11.3%  of the population is Muslim, eight Labour councillors who resigned from the party over the issue in November are considering putting up a candidate at the general election.
This month Ammar Anwar, a Labour councillor in Kirklees, Yorkshire, and a lifelong member of the party, announced his resignation  in tears and with a Palestinian flag draped around his neck. Eleven Labour councillors in Burnley resigned from the party  in November, 10 resigned in Oxford , eight quit in Blackburn , and there have been others.
Aftab Nawaz, one of those who resigned in Walsall, said he had been inundated with messages of support from the Muslim community. “We had calls from all over the place, not just in Walsall. People were coming up to us and hugging us and saying well done, you’ve stood up for what you believe, you’ve stood up for us and you’ll always be our heroes. We’re not heroes,” he said.
Nawaz said he had been unhappy with the party’s creeping “central control”, but it was its response to the war that pushed him over the edge. “We saw a side of the Labour party which we didn’t expect,” he said. “If we are sitting at home or in our mosques praying for the people of Palestine, yet we represent a party whose leader isn’t saying that this should stop, we ourselves become complicit.”
He said walking away from Labour had been a difficult decision. His father, who came to work in the West Midlands metal-bashing factories, had been supported by Labour and the union movement at a time when ethnic minorities were being targeted by the National Front.
“We were all Labour people and we always trusted that the Labour party would do the right thing. People voted for the Labour party without even blinking, they wouldn’t read the manifesto,” he said.
He joined the party in 2000 and spent many hours campaigning as a paper candidate in wards that the party had little chance in winning – “we used to call it flying the red flag”.
“You’d go out in the middle of the snow and rain deliver leaflets and get people’s doors smashed in your face because they didn’t want to know anything,” he said. “But it was something that enriched my life, and I’ll never regret being part of the Labour party. We’re still Labour people. I’ve said to people it’s not that we’ve left the Labour party, the Labour party has left us.”
Qadri, the imam, who has been a party member for six years but is unlikely to vote for Labour in the next election, was confident he had a good insight into the views of the hundreds of people who attend Walsall Central mosque each week.
Younger people in particular were influenced by what they saw about the conflict on social media, he said. They were emailing their MPs to demand answers and passing the message on to older generations.
That message appeared to be cutting through in Walsall. Nahid Ahmed, 54, a former Labour party member of 15 years who left the party over its stance on Palestine, said he would vote for an independent candidate or abstain. “Labour thinks Muslims are going to vote [for them] anyway, but they have to understand this has changed now,” he said.
Even if Starmer explicitly backed an immediate and permanent ceasefire now after months of death and destruction, it may not bring Muslim votes back into the fold.
“As things are getting worse in Palestine, you would expect their sense of moral duty, their humane side, to have come out and it hasn’t. That trust is lost,” said Sajad, 40, who declined to give her surname.
In the immediate aftermath of the horrific atrocities committed by Hamas and others on 7 October, the Labour leadership offered full-throated support for Israel. In an interview on LBC radio  a few days later, Starmer said Israel had the right to withhold power and water in Gaza. His words – which he later sought to clarify  – shocked many Labour supporters.
In response, three senior frontbenchers – Streeting, Shabana Mahmood and Louise Haigh – warned in a shadow cabinet meeting  that Labour was at risk of losing Muslim votes.
The following month, 56 Labour MPs rebelled against the leadership  by backing a Scottish National party amendment to the king’s speech that explicitly called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Eight frontbenchers resigned their posts.
Despite his shadow cabinet warning, Streeting was not among them. In his Ilford North constituency, protests were held outside the MP’s constituency office, and a grassroots organisation, the Redbridge Community Action Group (RCAG), was formed.
“Trust has irretrievably broken down between British Muslims and the Labour party. It’s a fundamental break,” said Vaseem Ahmed, a spokesperson for the RCAG. Leading Labour MPs had shown a “lack of empathy to the 75-year suffering of the Palestinian people … For them, Palestinian lives matter much less than others,” he said.
This month the RCAG held a meeting to choose an independent candidate to contest the general election. “We are proud to live in a democracy and we are using democracy to make our views known,” Ahmed said.
The candidate, Leanne Mohamad, a 23-year-old British-Palestinian who grew up in the constituency, said: “It’s clear to me and countless others that Labour no longer represents the interests of working people. British Muslims are aghast at what is taking place in Gaza and they have marched in their millions to make this point.”
She said Labour had failed “to hold Israel to account for its actions and they still haven’t called for an immediate ceasefire in order to save lives. The sheer hypocrisy between their position on Ukraine when compared to Gaza lays bare what many, including Muslims, now see as a party devoid of any principles whatsoever.”
Mahmoud Rauf, 77, a retired accountant who has lived in the area for more than 40 years and is a lifelong Labour supporter, said he had previously canvassed for Streeting but would not do so again, and may not even vote Labour at the next election.
“Wes Streeting might have a good bashing when the election comes because this area [is home to] a lot of supporters from the Palestinian side,” he said. “I don’t support [him] any more. I don’t see that he’s playing fair.”
Another accountant, Imtyaz Vakil, 54, a Labour voter who switched to the Conservatives after the Iraq war, said he would never again vote for either party. He had joined RCAG and would be supporting Mohamed in the election, saying her candidacy was “the first piece in the whole jigsaw”.
Political parties would ignore Muslim voices at their peril, he said. “It’s the second, third generation of Muslims here and we’re growing. We’re not just going to sit back and accept that.”
In recent weeks, senior Labour figures have toughened their language in response to the scale of killing and destruction in Gaza. Last month, Streeting spoke of the need for a “sustainable ceasefire”  amid “intolerable civilian casualties”. On Tuesday, Starmer told the Commons: “What is needed in Gaza is a humanitarian truce now, a sustainable ceasefire to stop the killing of innocent civilians.”
Streeting told the Guardian: “For the last nine years I’ve consistently fought for all communities in Redbridge, including launching the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims … [and] campaigning for the recognition of a Palestinian state and the end of human rights abuses. The next election is a choice between five more years of Conservative failure or change for the better with Labour.”  This article was amended on 30 January 2024 to remove text stating incorrectly that the Palestine Solidarity Campaign had registered a new pro-Palestine party.

Highlight: UK PM steps up calls for humanitarian needs to be met in Israel-Hamas conflictIsrael-Hamas war: latest updates
Body


Rishi Sunak has increased his calls for humanitarian aid to Gaza, urging the restoration of water supplies where possible.
The prime minister said the UK supported “absolutely” Israel’s right to defend itself against the “murderous enemy” of Hamas, and that Israel had a duty to restore its security and bring back its citizens being held hostage.
He also said the people of Gaza were “suffering terribly at the moment, with the casualty numbers climbing constantly”.
Writing in the Telegraph, Sunak said: “We need to see a stream of trucks rolling through that crossing to bring aid to the civilian population. We also need to see all water supplies to Gaza restored where physically possible.
“All sides should commit to the sanctity of UN installations, hospitals and shelters. We’re working intensively with international partners to ensure that British nationals currently trapped in Gaza are also able to leave through this crossing while aid enters.”
His comments show the UK stepping up calls for humanitarian needs to be met in the conflict, amid continuing signs that Israel could launch a ground offensive in Gaza.
Sunak said he had been clear with his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, that “this must be done in line with international humanitarian law and taking every possible step to avoid harming civilians”.
Lisa Nandy, the shadow international development secretary, said Labour was calling for water supplies to be restored and aid delivered.
She said Labour supported Israel’s “right to self-defence and to return the hostages, and we support the Palestinian people, especially in Gaza, at what is a desperately, desperately critical, difficult time, where the world simply cannot afford to walk away.”
Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, said he expected Israel to strike in a “surgical” way but it was “entirely likely” that more civilian lives would be lost in Gaza.
“The real tragedy here is that Hamas, who started this war by committing those appalling barbaric atrocities in Israel, deliberately enmesh themselves with the civilian infrastructure in Gaza using Palestinians – innocent Palestinians – as hostages to their own political aims,” he said.
“And so it is entirely likely that more civilian lives will be lost in this appalling conflict. But we have to defend Israel’s right to secure its borders, to release the hostages and to bring a degree of security to their situation.
“What we need Israel to do is to surgically degrade and eradicate Hamas and their infrastructure in the Gaza Strip so that Palestinians can be free from Hamas and Israel can have the security that it needs.”
He told Sky News that the UK was doing “everything we can” to support British nationals trapped in Gaza, although so far no one has been allowed to leave across the border to Egypt, with the Rafah crossing only opened for a limited amount of aid to flow to Palestinians.
Twenty aid trucks were allowed through the crossing from Egypt over the weekend, and about 200 are waiting to go into Gaza.
The Palestinian ambassador to the UK has warned that a “humanitarian catastrophe” is unfolding in Gaza. Husam Zomlot told Sky News: “Carnage, horror, in every sense, families have to make choices of should they leave, should they stay. Families are thinking of rationing water with children, which child can sustain more. Oxfam, the UN are describing a situation that is simply unprecedented in recent history, and perhaps unprecedented period.”

Body


Good morning. In the first stage of Israel’s war with Hamas, Palestinian civilians were urged to flee the north of the Gaza Strip and find refuge in safer areas in the south. After the collapse of the weeklong truce on Friday, it is the south that has faced the brunt of Israel’s attacks.
The focal point of Israel’s airstrikes and artillery fire for the last few days has been Khan Younis, the second largest city in the region. People have been ordered to evacuate the city, and now the Israel Defence Forces say that they have expanded ground operations “across all of the Gaza Strip”.  An hour ago, Unicef spokesman James Elder described  a sleepless night “of utterly relentless bombardments” in Khan Younis. There have also been reports of clashes between Hamas and Israeli troops a mile from the city.
Israel says it is taking unprecedented steps to prevent civilian casualties. As the onslaught intensifies, a new question hovers over the conflict: is Israel doing enough to keep its key western allies – especially the US – behind it?
Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh in Jerusalem, is about the next phase of the war in Gaza: Israel’s plan of attack, the diplomatic limits on its freedom to operate, and what it means for the Palestinians being asked to evacuate again. Here are the headlines.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            UK politics  | Labour will not “turn on the spending taps” if it wins the next election , Keir Starmer will say on Monday, bolstering the view of some of his senior MPs that he is preparing to sign up to austerity-style public sector cuts. The Labour leader will use a speech on the economy to warn that Britain is in its worst economic state in more than half a century.
                                            Cop28  | The president of Cop28, Sultan Al Jaber, has claimed there is “no science” indicating that a phase-out of fossil fuels is needed to restrict global heating to 1.5C. In remarks during a live online event last month that scientists described as “verging on climate denial”, Al Jaber claimed a phase-out of fossil fuels risked “taking the world back into caves”. 
                                            Immigration  | Ministers are deliberately hiding  the mounting costs of the Rwanda deportation scheme from the public, the head of an influential parliamentary watchdog has told the Guardian, as insiders expect a new deal with the African country to be signed off within days.
                                            India  | A Sikh activist in Birmingham complained that Indian police were verbally harassing him  by phone and threatening his family in Punjab months before his sudden death in June, a Guardian investigation has found. Avtar Singh Khanda’s family have called his death suspicious, but British authorities have said that there is no reason to suspect foul play.
                                            UK news  | Glenys Kinnock, the senior Labour politician and wife of the former leader Neil Kinnock, has died aged 79.  Her family called her “a proud democratic socialist” who campaigned “for justice and against poverty all her life.”
                   In depth: ‘The window of opportunity is closing for Israel’                   
The seven-day ceasefire in Gaza that saw the release of 105 Israeli hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners now seems a very long time ago. Ismael al-Thawabteh, the director general of the government media office in Hamas-run Gaza, said yesterday that more than 700 Palestinians had been killed in 24 hours, while the health ministry said later that 316 had been killed “in the past hours”. The heaviest attacks have been in and around the city of Khan Younis, in the south of the strip.
People in areas to the south-east of the city have now been told by the Israeli military to leave, apparently paving the way for a ground incursion. “As soon as the truce ended, it was clear that the focus would now be on the south, and Khan Younis in particular,” Dan Sabbagh said. “That is where Israel believes Hamas’ leadership to be hiding out.” Israel’s political and military leadership argue that if they can kill senior Hamas commanders, they will take a significant step towards forcing the organisation’s collapse.
In the first phase of the conflict, Israel’s attacks produced limited diplomatic pressure from its allies; most significantly, the US placed few practical limits on its support, though it decried the loss of civilian life. Now it is taking a firmer line on the avoidance of civilian casualties. But it is not yet clear how deeply that will impact Israel’s strategy.
***
What is the US saying about the new phase of the war?
“Israel arguably has a higher tolerance for international condemnation of its actions than almost any other country,” Dan said. The only country with the leverage to seriously affect its actions is the United States. And in the last few days, US public statements have taken on a new tone.
On Thursday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken was reported to have told Israel’s war cabinet  that it may only have weeks to complete its plan to defeat Hamas in Gaza. In a press conference, he said that he had “underscored the imperative – for the United States – that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale that we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the South.” That warning was echoed by US vice-president Kamala Harris and defence secretary Lloyd Austin over the weekend.
“There is a sense that the window of opportunity is closing for Israel,” Dan said. “It is clearly having to frame its strategy in a way that keeps the US on board.” But more consequential than US public statements will be whether it backs them up with concrete actions. On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported  (£) a surge in US arms supplied to Israel since the war began, with tens of thousands of bombs and shells including heavy “bunker busters” provided on top of billions of dollars’ worth of existing annual support for its military operations. “One question is whether the military support continues in spite of the political narrative,” Dan said.
***
Have US warnings led to a change in Israel’s strategy?
Israel has devised a new map which subdivides Gaza into hundreds of small blocs, which it is using to announce its evacuation orders. Israel points to that initiative as evidence of its desire to protect civilians by focusing on the most precise areas possible and giving people time to flee by announcing them ahead of its attacks. By Sunday, residents of 34 of the blocs, all of them in and around Khan Younis, had been told to depart for safer territory. Israel’s minister of strategic affairs Ron Dermer called that approach “unprecedented”, adding: “If we wanted to do it fast, we’d harm a lot more civilians.”
But that system has come under heavy criticism  from agencies and aid workers on the ground, who say that a map accessed via a QR code on social media posts and leaflets dropped into Khan Younis will be of little use to those without access to reliable internet services – or electricity to charge their phones. Rohan Talbot, advocacy director at the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said that it amounted to nothing more than a “macabre game of Battleships”. There have been reports of bombing outside the designated areas.
“One problem is whether enough time is being given to civilians to escape,” Dan said. “The bombing started on Friday more or less as the leaflets were dropped. So there is some scepticism about whether this is truly a different strategy.” Fundamentally, he added, critics of Israel’s approach say that “whether you cut the cake into large pieces or small pieces, it amounts to the same thing. They ask where civilians are supposed to go to be safe.” Many have already fled from the bombardment in the north, and may fear that wherever they head next will also be targeted. “People who fled to Khan Younis can’t go back to the north, where large areas are a wasteland anyway,” Dan said. “The safe spaces in the south are being reduced too.”
Nonetheless, the US signalled on Sunday that it viewed the grid approach as evidence that Israel was taking its stance seriously. “We believe they have been receptive to our messages here of trying to minimise civilian casualties,” US national security council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC yesterday , pointing to the map as evidence. “There’s not a whole lot of modern militaries that would do that … to telegraph their punches in that way. So they are making an effort.”
***
What does all this mean for Palestinian civilians?
The Israeli maps feature large arrows pointing residents of the targeted areas around Khan Younis in the general direction of humanitarian shelters and a so-called “humanitarian zone” towards the coast, where the IDF has previously said  that “international humanitarian aid will be provided as needed”. But there are urgent questions about whether there will be any real measure of safety when aid supplies are already drying up under the pressure of vast numbers of displaced people.
The UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, said on Saturday  that about 1.8 million Palestinians have already been internally displaced – close to 80% of the Gaza Strip’s population. (It added that “obtaining an accurate count is challenging”.) The UN’s high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, told the BBC that people in Gaza are being “pushed more and more towards a narrow corner of what is already a very narrow territory”. And despite an increase in aid being allowed into Gaza during the pause, the supplies are still dwarfed by the need, Dan said.
“This is already a very severe humanitarian crisis,” he added. “But it is at risk of getting even more severe. Shelters are already badly overcrowded – there’s one in Khan Younis  designed for 1,000 people where there are now 35,000, with 600 people to every toilet. There is anxiety that there will not be enough fuel to run desalination plants that provide a lot of people with drinking water. And there has been no real opportunity in the last week for aid agencies to do a serious needs assessment for different areas.”
If a ground offensive now develops in the south, civilians will nonetheless have little alternative but to run again. Some are deeply sceptical that doing so will save their lives. Halima Abdel-Rahman, a widow and mother of four who has already fled her home for Khan Younis, told the Associated Press she would no longer listen to evacuation orders. “The occupation tells you to go to this area, then they bomb it,” she said. “The reality is that no place is safe in Gaza.”

Highlight: Assistance comes ahead of Israel’s anticipated ground assault into Gaza but advisers will not engage in fighting, says US official
Body


The Pentagon is sending military advisers and sophisticated air defense systems to Israel ahead of an anticipated ground assault into Gaza by Israel’s military.
One of the officers leading the assistance is Marine Corps Lt Gen James Glynn, who previously helped lead special operations forces against the Islamic State and served a high-profile role during intense combat in Falluja , one of the bloodiest and most controversial  centers of battle  for US forces during the war in Iraq.
Glynn will also be advising on how to mitigate civilian casualties during urban warfare, a US official told the Associated Press, on condition of anonymity.
Israel is preparing a large-scale ground operation in an environment in which Hamas militants based in Gaza have had years to prepare tunnel networks and set traps throughout northern Gaza’s dense urban blocks. Glynn and the other military officers who are advising Israel “have experience that is appropriate to the sorts of operations that Israel is conducting”, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said on Monday in a briefing at the White House.
The US advisers will not be engaged in any fighting, the US official said, adding that Glynn will also be offering guidance on mitigating civilian casualties during urban warfare.
The military team is one of many fast-moving pieces the Pentagon is getting in place to try to prevent the already intense conflict between Israel and Hamas from becoming a wider war.
It also is trying to protect US personnel, who in the last few days have come under repeated attacks  in Iraq and Syria, chiefly as a result of armed drones, that the Pentagon has said were probably endorsed by Iran.
Kirby said Iran was “in some cases actively facilitating these attacks and spurring on others who may want to exploit the conflict for their own good, or for that of Iran. We know that Iran’s goal is to maintain some level of deniability here. But we’re not going to allow them to do that.”
On Monday, the US military garrison at al-Tanf, Syria, came under attack again, this time by two drones.
Last Thursday, the US destroyer USS Carney shot down four land-attack cruise missiles launched from Yemen that the Pentagon has said were potentially headed towards Israel.
Over the weekend, the Pentagon announced it was sending multiple Patriot missile defense system battalions and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to the Middle East, as well as repositioning the US aircraft carrier Eisenhower-led strike group to the US Central Command (Centcom) area of responsibility. Florida-based Centcom has authority over US forces in the Middle East and in west and central Asia. The ship had previously been en route to the eastern Mediterranean.
The shift means that the navy will have a carrier strike group off the shore of Israel – the Ford carrier strike group – and another, the Eisenhower, potentially maneuvered to defend US forces and Israel from the Red Sea or the Gulf of Oman.
“We’re going to continue to do what we need to do to protect and safeguard our forces and take all necessary measures,” the official said. “No one wants to see a wider regional conflict. But we will not hesitate to protect our forces.”

US troops attacked in Iraq and Syria as west warns of ‘spillover’ from Israel conflict

Highlight: Iranian proxies appear to be stepping up threats as tensions rise on Israel’s border with LebanonIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Western officials are voicing mounting concern over the risk of a regional “spillover” from the conflict between Israel and Hamas, as US forces in the region come under repeated drone attack, including in Iraq.
Amid indications that Israel may be poised to launch a major ground offensive into Gaza, and escalating tensions on Israel’s boundary with Lebanon, Iranian proxies in particular appeared to be stepping up their threats.
The Ain al-Asad airbase, which hosts US and other international forces in western Iraq, was targeted by drones and missiles on Thursday evening, according to security sources. Multiple blasts were reportedly heard inside the base.
The Iraqi military said it had closed the area around the base and started a search operation. It was not clear yet whether the attacks had caused casualties or damages.
The assault came after rockets hit another military base hosting US forces near Baghdad’s international airport on Thursday, according to Iraqi police.
US military forces in Iraq were also targeted on Wednesday in two separate drone attacks, with one causing minor injuries to a small number of troops even though the US military managed to intercept the armed drone.
On Wednesday, a drone hit US forces in Syria, resulting in minor injuries, while another one was brought down.
Earlier on Thursday, the USS Carney, a navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea, intercepted three land attack cruise missiles and several drones that were launched by Houthi forces in Yemen.
A Pentagon spokesperson told reporters the missiles were “potentially” headed toward Israel but said the US had not finished its assessment of what they were targeting. The action by the Carney potentially represented the first shots by the US military in the defence of Israel in this conflict.
The events of the past fortnight, since Hamas massacred more than 1,400 Israelis in a surprise attack on communities near the Gaza border and took almost 200 hostages, have posed serious political dilemmas for states with peace treaties with Israel – Jordan and Egypt – and those that have been edging towards normalising relations, including a number of Gulf states.
The ferocity of Israel’s airstrikes on Gaza after Hamas’s murderous assault, and the accompanying rhetoric, has provoked demonstrations across the region, pushing governments from Cairo to Riyadh to walk a tightrope of political statements not always backed by the same sentiments in private.
That has been exploited by Tehran and its proxies in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, who have taken an increasingly hostile posture, including towards US forces in the region, as the prospect of an Israeli ground offensive edges ever closer.
Last week it was reported that Iran had warned Israel via the UN that it would have to “intervene” if Israel invaded Gaza.
That message was amplified on Thursday by a deputy commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Gholamhossein Gheybparvar, who in a speech said that Iran-backed militia in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen were ready to strike Israel if its ground forces invaded Gaza.
The posture of Iran and its proxies, not least Hezbollah in Lebanon, which poses the most direct threat to Israel from the north, continues to be ambiguous, with Hezbollah allowing Palestinian factions in Lebanon to fire missiles.
On Friday Hezbollah issued a statement saying it had targeted Israeli positions in the contested Shaba farms with guided missiles and other “appropriate” weapons. Earlier, unidentified gunmen were reported to have infiltrated the northern Israeli community of Margaliot, to which Israel retaliated with artillery fire.
More widely, Tehran appears to have reactivated a strategy – launched in 2019 before the US assassination of the head of the Iranian al-Quds force, Qassem Soleimani, in a missile strike in Baghdad – to target US forces.
While the death of Soleimani, the architect of Tehran’s modern iteration of the so-called “axis of resistance”, plunged that network of proxies into disarray, events of the past week suggest it has reconfigured, with attack drones so far its preferred weapon.
Iran historically has been highly averse to direct involvement in conflict, after its experiences of the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988 in which it lost at least 500,000 fighters, but in recent years it has pursued a much more aggressive regional policy via its proxies, increasing the risk of a catastrophic misjudgment.
Amid concerns over the potential for an intervention by Tehran and its allies, Joe Biden has sent two aircraft carriers, other warships and about 2,000 marines to the region. US officials have said Washington is on heightened alert for activity by Iran-backed groups.
This week the US also encouraged American citizens in Lebanon to leave by any available flight amid fears the violence could spill over, perhaps seeing the opening of a second front between Hezbollah and Israel.
One concern, increasingly being voiced by US officials, is that a deliberate effort could be made to draw Washington into the conflict via militias attacking US forces in Iraq and Syria.
Briefing journalists on Thursday, the Pentagon spokesperson, Gen Patrick Ryder, said: “Right now, this conflict is contained between Israel and Hamas, and we’re going to do everything we can to ensure deterrence in the region, so that this does not become a broader regional conflict.”
Israel has called up a record 360,000 reservists and has been bombarding the Gaza Strip after Hamas’s 7 October assault. At least 3,785 Palestinians have been killed and 12,493 wounded in Israeli strikes on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory.
On Thursday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the risk of regional spillover from the Israel-Hamas war was “real”.
Speaking at the Hudson Institute in Washington, Von der Leyen also said dialogue between Israel and its neighbours must continue.
“We have seen the Arab streets fill with rage all across the region. So the risk of a regional spillover is real,” she said. “Iran, Hamas’s patron, only wants to fuel the fire of chaos,” she added.
Underlining the risk, Belgium on Friday became the latest country to advise its citizens to leave Lebanon, seen as one of the most likely countries to be sucked in.
In Lebanon’s southern city of Tyre, the head of the municipal council said in a statement that 7,500 families had abandoned their houses in the southern border region and sought shelter in different municipalities of the city.

Highlight: Lt Gen Herzi Halevi also says Israeli troops are operating inside city ‘fighting in close quarters’Israel and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Israel forces have surrounded Gaza City on three sides and are operating inside the city, fighting in close quarters, their top military commander has said.
In a televised statement, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) chief of staff, said: “[Israeli forces] are in the heart of northern Gaza, operating in Gaza City, surrounding it.”
Halevi’s comments came as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was heading to Israel and Jordan for talks on Friday to push for the humanitarian pause requested by President Joe Biden. 
The intensifying Israeli bombardment has killed thousands of Palestinians, and those sheltering from the assault are running out of clean water and facing increasing health risks as public services become unable to operate and hospitals close.
In Khan Younis, in the south of the densely populated territory, nine-year-old Rafif Abu Ziyada said she was drinking dirty water and getting stomach pains and headaches. “There is no cooking gas, there is no water, we don’t eat well. We are getting sick,” she said. “There’s garbage on the ground and the whole place is polluted.”
Blinken said he planned to discuss concrete steps to minimise harm to civilians in Gaza, adding that in recent days civilians had continued to bear the brunt of the conflict.
Seven United Nations experts called on Thursday for a ceasefire in the territory, saying time was running out for Palestinian people there who were at “grave risk of genocide”. The Israeli mission to the UN in Geneva said it was preparing a response to the experts’ remarks.
Duiring heavy clashes on the outskirts of Gaza’s urban areas in recent days, 18 Israeli soldiers have been killed, including a senior officer, as troops have faced a series of ambushes.
Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Israeli forces had pushed through the outskirts of Gaza City. “We’re at the height of the battle,” the prime minister said. “We’ve had impressive successes and have passed the outskirts of Gaza City. We are advancing.”
Meanwhile, Israel and Hezbollah continued to exchange fire  on Thursday across the Lebanese border, with a rocket fired from Lebanon hitting a house in the northern town of Kiryat Shmona. Hezbollah claimed it had used two drones to target Israeli forces.
Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of the Lebanese Shia militant group, is due on Friday to make his first public remarks in Beirut since Hamas’s surprise attack on southern Israel.
In an apparent warning to Hezbollah, with whom the IDF has been engaged in daily cross-border exchanges, Halevi said “less than half” of the Israeli air force was involved in airstrikes on Gaza with “most of its force ready, with bombs loaded should the need arise, to attack on other fronts”.
The White House has called for “humanitarian pauses” to facilitate aid to and evacuations from Gaza but opposed a ceasefire, which it regarded as benefiting Hamas. Blinken’s planned talks were aimed at seeking “urgent mechanisms” to reduce regional tensions, his office said.
Arab countries, including those allied with the US and at peace with Israel, have expressed mounting unease over the war, with Jordan recalling its ambassador to Israel.
The conflict began on 7 October when Hamas launched an onslaught on southern Israel that killed more than 1,400 people and swept up hundreds more as hostages. The current Israeli estimate of the number of hostages is 242. Israeli bombardments have killed at least 8,796 people in Gaza, including 3,648 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Unicef has described “horrific and appalling” scenes of carnage after two rounds of Israeli airstrikes on the Jabalia refugee camp  on Tuesday and Wednesday. “People’s homes have been levelled, hundreds apparently injured and killed, with many children reportedly among the casualties.” The health ministry called the strikes a “heinous massacre” that killed 195 people, including seven hostages.
Israeli officials said the bombing had killed senior Hamas commanders who sought to shield behind civilians and its targeting sought to minimise civilian casualties.
Egypt, meanwhile, said it was preparing to receive “about 7,000” people  representing more than 60 nationalities through the newly opened crossing  that borders southern Gaza, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday, without specifying a timeline.
A trickle of aid  has flowed into Gaza from Rafah since the conflict began but until this week no one was allowed to leave the territory. Foreign governments say there are passport holders from 44 countries, as well as 28 agencies, including UN bodies, in Gaza. The United Arab Emirates said it planned to treat 1,000 children but did not specify how they would travel to the Gulf state.
Germany has said it will ban activities linked to Hamas, already a designated terrorist organisation in the country, as well as those of the pro-Palestinian group Samidoun, which was accused of handing out baked goods in Berlin to celebrate the 7 October attack.
Some Israeli commentators and analysts said that behind the government’s continued rhetoric of vanquishing Hamas and total victory a rethink was taking place, prompted in part by the prospect of mounting IDF casualties and waning international support for Israel amid carnage in Gaza.
“Defeating Hamas has evolved from an immediate tactical objective into a long-term Israeli strategy, one that will include establishing a security zone, mining the border with Gaza and applying ongoing pressure,” Nadav Eyal wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth. “I’m sorry to say, but to me that sounds like another southern Lebanon.”

Highlight: Israeli PM cancels White House visit by two ministers and says US ‘abandoned its policy in the UN’ after abstaining on vote
Body


The UN security council has voted to demand an immediate ceasefire in Gaza  for the first time since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, after the US dropped a threat to veto, bringing Israel to near total isolation on the world stage.
The vote result sets up the strongest public clash between the US president, Joe Biden, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, since the war began.
The US abstained and the 14 other council members all voted in favour of the security council ceasefire resolution, put forward by the 10 elected council members who voiced their frustration with more than five months of deadlock between the major powers. Applause broke out in the chamber after the vote.
The text demanded “an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan leading to a lasting sustainable ceasefire”. It also demanded the release of hostages but did not make a truce dependent on them being freed, as Washington had previously demanded.
Netanyahu alleged the US had “abandoned its policy in the UN” with Monday’s abstention, giving hope to Hamas of a truce without giving up its hostages, and therefore “harming both the war effort and the effort to release the hostages”.
Netanyahu’s office cancelled a visit to Washington by two of his ministers, intended to discuss a planned Israeli offensive on the southernmost Gazan city of Rafah, which the US opposes. The White House said it was “very disappointed” by the decision. However, a previously arranged visit by the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, went ahead.
The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, underscored in the meeting with Gallant that alternatives existed to a ground invasion of Rafah that would both better ensure Israel’s security and protect Palestinian civilians, the state department said.
White House spokesperson John Kirby said the UN vote did not represent a shift in US policy, but the resolution signaled a significant break between the Biden administration and the Israeli government – and represented a long-delayed show of international unity on Gaza after more than 32,000 Palestinians have been reported dead, thousands more are missing, and UN agencies are warning that a major famine is imminent.
The Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, called the security council vote a belated “vote for humanity to prevail”.
“This must be a turning point. This must lead to saving lives on the ground,” Mansour told the council. “Apologies to those who the world has failed, to those that could have been saved but were not.”
The isolation of the Israeli government was underlined even further on Monday, when the Israel Hayom newspaper published an interview with Donald Trump, a close political ally of Netanyahu, who said: “You have to finish up your war.
“Israel has to be very careful, because you’re losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support,” Trump said.
Hamas welcomed the resolution and said it stood ready for an immediate exchange of prisoners with Israel, raising hopes of a breakthrough in negotiations under way in Doha, where intelligence chiefs and other officials from the US, Egypt and Qatar are seeking to broker a deal that would involve the release of at least 40 of the estimated 130 hostages held by Hamas for several hundred Palestinian detainees and prisoners, and a truce that would last an initial six weeks.
On Tuesday, a UN human rights expert will deliver a report calling for Israel to be placed under an arms embargo, on the grounds that it has carried out acts of “genocide” in Gaza.
Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, said in her report, which has been seen by the Guardian, there were “reasonable grounds” to believe that Israel was carrying out three of the five acts defined as genocide. 
In Washington, Gallant insisted Israel would go on fighting until the hostages were released.
“We have no moral right to stop the war while there are still hostages held in Gaza,” Gallant said before his first meeting, with the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. “The lack of a decisive victory in Gaza may bring us closer to a war in the north.”
The “war in the north” appeared to a reference to a looming conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and a suggestion that that militant group would see the lack of victory in Gaza as a sign of weakness.
The US abstention followed three vetoes of earlier ceasefire resolutions, in October, December and February. It marks the significant widening of a rift with the Netanyahu government, reflecting mounting frustration in Washington at the prime minister’s defiant insistence that Israeli forces will go ahead with the Rafah attack, and at persistent Israeli hindrance of humanitarian aid deliveries.
Minutes before the vote on Monday morning, the US asked for an amendment adding a condemnation of Hamas for its attack on Israel on 7 October, leading to urgent huddles of diplomats on the chamber floor, but dropped that demand when it became clear the amendment would be resisted. The US did, however, prevail over the weekend in replacing the word “permanent” with “lasting” in describing the ceasefire that was the ultimate goal of the resolution.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US envoy to the UN, said: “Certain key edits were ignored, including our requests to add a condemnation of Hamas, and we did not agree with everything in the resolution. For that reason we were unfortunately not able to vote yes. However, as I’ve said before, we fully support some of the critical objectives in this non-binding resolution.”
Her claim that it was non-binding was quickly challenged by UN scholars. Resolutions passed by the UN security council are generally considered legally binding, particularly when the text demands action, reflecting the unequivocal will of the international community. In its own defeated resolution last week, the US had avoided the word “demands”, but rather called it “imperative” to have a ceasefire and a hostage release. 
The UK abstained on the three earlier ceasefire resolutions but voted in favour of Monday’s text. In explaining the vote, the British ambassador, Barbara Woodward, did not make clear what had allowed the change in the UK’s vote. British officials, however, have said that Downing Street policy was not to adopt positions at the UN that were directly at odds with Washington.
“This resolution needs to be implemented immediately,” Woodward said, on being asked if the text was binding. “It sends a clear council message, a united council message, and we expect all council resolutions to be implemented.”
Thomas-Greenfield had also insisted that the wording of the resolution “means a ceasefire of any duration must come with the release of hostages”. But the wording of the resolution, intensely debated over the weekend, demands a ceasefire and a hostage release in parallel. It does not make one conditional on the other.
The security council resolution also “emphasises the urgent need” for the expansion of the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza and for civilians to be protected, in acknowledgment of the huge civilian death toll and the UN warnings of famine.

                                                                                         At least                         11,240 Palestinians have been killed, including 4,630 children and 3,130 women,  within the Gaza Strip by Israeli military actions since 7 October, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said on Monday.                                                                                           Israeli forces have reached the gates of Gaza’s largest hospital as hundreds of patients, including dozens of babies, remained trapped inside.  Thousands of people have fled al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, but health officials said the remaining patients were dying due to energy shortages amid intense fighting between Israeli troops and Hamas militants. At least 32 patients, including three premature babies, had died over the past three days, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said. 
                                                                                         There are between 600 and 650 inpatients at Shifa, as well as 200 to 500 health workers, and about 1,500 displaced people seeking shelter there, according to information shared with the World Health Organization. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have repeatedly said that Hamas operates from bunkers underneath Shifa. This has been denied by Hamas and hospital staff.                                                                                          Joe Biden has said that Gaza’s largest hospital “must be protected” and called for “less intrusive action” by Israeli forces.  Speaking from the Oval Office, he said: “It is my hope and expectation that there will be less intrusive action.”                                                                 The Palestine Red Crescent Society said that an attempt to reach al-Quds hospital from Khan Younis in order to evacuate patients has been abandoned due to “continuing shelling and shooting”.                                                                                           All of the hospitals in northern Gaza are “out of service” amid fuel shortages and intense combat, the health ministry has said on Monday.                                                                                          The director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) Thomas White has warned that all of the group’s aid operations in Gaza will be shut down in the next 48 hours unless fuel is allowed in. UNRWA commissioner-general Philippe Lazzarini said the agency’s fuel depot in Gaza has run dry and will no longer be able to resupply hospitals, remove sewage and provide drinking water.                                                                                                                                The IDF issued an update on its military operation in Gaza, saying its forces have conducted 4,300 strikes to date. It claims to have struck “approximately 300 tunnel shafts” and “approximately 3,000 terrorist infrastructure sites”. Israel’s campaign was launched on 7 October after the Hamas massacre inside Israel’s border which killed 1,200 Israelis.                                                                                          UNRWA also reported that one of its buildings in Rafah has been struck by Israel’s navy.  Rafah is in the south of the Gaza Strip, within the area that Israel has insisted that Palestinians move to. In a statement, UNRWA said there were no casualties.                                                                                           At least three Palestinians have been killed and 20 others injured after an Israeli airstrike hit Bani Suheila, a town east of Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip, health officials have said on Monday.                                                                                            Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, has acknowledged the growing international pressure for a ceasefire.  He also estimated that Israel has a “diplomatic window” of between two and three weeks before pressure on the country seriously begins to increase, local media reported.                                                                  Haaretz reports that an Israeli civilian hit by anti-tank missile fire from Lebanon inside Israel’s north on Sunday has died of their wounds. Israel’s military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that fire is again being exchanged Monday between Israel and anti-Israeli forces in Lebanon.                                                                                           UN workers observed a minute’s silence on Monday for the more than 100 colleagues killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began last month,  marking the deadliest conflict ever for UN workers.                                                                                           The archbishop of Canterbury has called for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas,  saying the scale of civilian deaths and humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza cannot not be “morally justified”.                                                                 A vessel from Turkey carrying materials for field hospitals arrived on Monday in Egypt ’s port of El Arish, near the Rafah border crossing. A Turkish health official told AFP that the vessel was carrying “materials, generators, ambulances to establish eight field hospitals”.                                                                 Authorities in France on Monday detained eight minors over antisemitic chants on the Paris metro that were filmed and widely shared on social media, prosecutors said.                                                                 In the UK, former prime minister David Cameron has unexpectedly been appointed as the new foreign secretary  in a reshuffle of Rishi Sunak ’s government. Cameron replaces James Cleverly,  who visited Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and southern Israel on 11 October, just days after the Hamas attack.                                                                                           Tony Blair, t he former British prime minister, has let it be known that he is available if needed to help in an effort to end the growing crisis in Israel and Palestine.                                                                                           Ireland ’s deputy premier has announced he is to travel to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory later this week. Micheál Martin, who is also foreign affairs minister, will also travel to Egypt as part of the visit.

Highlight: Daily funerals bring little solace to a traumatised nation grieving for communities such as Kfar Aza, Ofakim and Sderot that took the brunt of the 7 October attackWarning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting
Body


The stench of death still pervades Kfar Aza, an Israeli kibbutz on the periphery of the blockaded Gaza Strip. The street closest to the barbed wire border fence, just 50m away from the three-mile (5km) buffer zone that separates the territories, previously housed the kibbutz’s volunteers. These young adults lived in around 40 small homes designed for single occupancy, staying for a few months at a time to explore the socialist and environmental principles typical of a kibbutz lifestyle.
As there are several communal bomb shelters in the vicinity, the houses were not designed with safe rooms in which to wait out rocket attacks. Even if they were, the occupants would not have escaped Kfar Aza’s fate on 7 October, when Hamas burst out of its cage.
What came next has forever changed the region. Four weeks after the Palestinian militant group’s horrifying attack that killed 1,400 Israelis across southern Israel, there is only silence in this community, previously home to 750 people, perforated by blasts of nearby Israeli artillery fire and a warning of an incoming anti-tank missile.
Several Kfar Aza homes are too damaged to enter, their roofs caved in and insides burned out. Others show clear signs of struggle; blood-soaked sofas and mattresses are still propped up against doors and shattered windows.
Family photographs, splintered guitars, and books and tchotchkes thrown from shelves lie among broken glass, while bread left on the countertop and the contents of fridges rot in the desert heat. Fat yellow pomelos wait on the branch, but no one is coming to pick them; beneath the tree, spent bullet casings clink and chime underfoot. Posters protesting the Israeli government’s judicial overhaul and advertising a tennis tournament remain up, relics of a different reality.
“It’s not the physical damage I am worried about. I think the psychological damage will be much harder to repair,” said Hava Dann, 34, one of the few Kfar Azar residents who visit most days to look after the kibbutz’s animals and check on the now-dormant local plastics factory.
“I think people will come back, but it depends on what happens in Gaza and whether the situation remains the same with Hamas in charge. No one can face that.”
Around 7am on Saturday 7 October – the Jewish holy day of Shabbat and Simchat Torah, the last of the autumnal high holidays – about 70 Hamas fighters attacked Kfar Aza from four directions, getting through Israel’s defences by blowing up security cameras, automated weapons systems and motion detectors before mowing down the fence with bulldozers or flying over on hang gliders. They then fanned out using pick-up trucks and motorcycles.
Heavily armed men destroyed the kibbutz’s gate and headed first to the home of its security director, killing him, leaving the community even more vulnerable as the wave of terror began. Rocket-propelled grenades were used to force entry to homes, and fires lit to suffocate residents or drive them out, to be murdered outside instead.
In one house, said Simcha Dizengoff, a first responder with the Zaka emergency response service, who arrived at the scene on 11 October after the Israel Defence Forces finally regained control of the village, a birthday cake still sat on the table from the weekend. Following the unmistakable smell of burned flesh, his team found the bodies of two adults, two children and their grandmother in the safe room, hugging each other on the floor in the corner. The family were now reminiscent of the dead of Pompeii, he said; it was impossible to separate their corpses into body bags.
In another Kfar Aza house, a woman, naked from the waist down, had been bent over a bed and then shot in the back of the head. When the team tried to move her, a live grenade rolled out of her clenched hand.
At least one child, aged about six, had been killed by a knife plunged into his skull. Several other victims appeared to have been beheaded.
“I picked up body after body,” Dizengoff said. “In 32 years of volunteering and responding to car crashes and terrorist attacks I have never seen anything like this.”
A month on from 7 October, many people are still missing and some of the dead have yet to be identified; Israel has drafted archaeologists to help determine what are human or animal remains amid the ruins. In total, it is thought that 50 members of Kfar Aza were killed, along with 21 soldiers, and another 17 people kidnapped and taken back to Gaza’s labyrinth of tunnels as bargaining chips. The bodies of 20 Hamas fighters were also recovered from the kibbutz.
There are thousands more stories of unfathomable brutality in 22 kibbutzim, towns, military bases and highways across Israel’s south, where people attending the SuperNova rave in Re’im kibbutz were ambushed as they tried to flee. For many Israelis, the scale of the violence committed against Jewish and Bedouin citizens, as well as dozens of foreign workers, is still difficult to comprehend.
Funerals are still held daily, as more of the dead being examined in morgues are returned to their loved ones, but they bring little solace to a nation grappling with trauma of a magnitude not experienced since the Holocaust.
The lack of progress on the fate of 240 hostages in Gaza, and attempts by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to blame his generals rather than take responsibility for so many intelligence and response failures, have compounded the prevailing sentiment that the state is floundering and unable to keep its people safe. Beneath the weight of grief and shock, anger towards the government is reaching boiling point.
The focus of the new war, already the bloodiest chapter in the entire 75-year-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has moved to the Gaza Strip, where the death toll from Israeli bombing is put at more than 9,000 people, and 2.3m civilians are suffering from a lack of water, food, and medicine trapped under the most intense airstrikes launched anywhere in the world this century. On Thursday, a week after the ground invasion started, the IDF said its troops had encircled Gaza City in fierce face to face ground battles.
Israeli soldiers, rather than civilians, are now dying. With 23 killed already in ambushes by well-prepared Hamas fighters, the country is expecting military casualties akin to the war of independence in 1948, or the surprise Yom Kippur war  launched by Egypt and Syria 50 years and a day before the 7 October massacres.
Israelis living near the southern and northern borders – approximately 120,000 people – have been subject to unprecedented evacuation orders.  The authorities fear an escalation in the hostilities  with the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, on top of ballistic missiles launched towards Israel by the Houthi militia in Yemen. The conflict has already become a regional one, drawing in Tehran and its allies.
Most evacuees are now living in upmarket hotels in Tel Aviv or the tourist spots of Tiberias and Eilat, at the government’s expense. They have been told they cannot expect to return home until the beginning of next year at the earliest, while their temporary new homes are chaotic with deliveries of aid supplies and bored children.
The only community hit by Hamas that has been allowed to stay in their homes is the conservative working-class town of Ofakim, home to 32,000 people, which lies outside the closed military zone. Blackhawk helicopters hover overhead, and dozens of soldiers patrol its damaged streets and new checkpoints. Many residents, however, have chosen to leave anyway.
The Guardian visited Ofakim the day after the Hamas attacks. The trail of destruction wreaked by the militants was easy to follow.
It was discovered later that dozens of militants were still hiding in the area, some only captured or killed three weeks later. Two white Hamas Hilux pick-up trucks, surrounded by scattered fatigues, first aid supplies and ammunition, had been abandoned on Herzl Boulevard, one of the engines still running, and another car was set alight after a rocket hit.
The IDF now believes that the Hamas fighters were trying to seize Ofakim’s police station, as they did in Sderot, but were derailed by armed residents and off-duty police. Instead, about 10 of them turned the nearby quiet residential Ha-Tamar Street into a battleground, going from house to house to kill and capture. About 50 civilians and security forces were killed.
In an orange house halfway up Ha-Tamar, five men forced entry through the the back door at the home of Rachel and David Adri, a couple in their 60s, seizing their phones and smashing windows to use as sniping positions. Earlier that morning Rachel had called her son, a policeman, to say she had heard shots in the area. After Hamas arrived, Rachel, who speaks some Arabic, engaged them in small talk for the next 20 hours, making food and even bandaging one captor’s hand, stalling for time until help arrived.
When she thought she could hear Israeli police in the garden – among them her son, who had briefed his colleagues about the structure of the house - Rachel put her head in her hands, pretending she had a headache, spreading out her fingers and thumb across her forehead to indicate that five men were inside.
“I knew that if they are hungry, they are angry … They pointed a weapon at me and also threatened a grenade. I told them I had to inject insulin, trying to distract them from the fact I have children who are police officers,” she told Israeli media.
During the Guardian’s return visit to Ofakim, there were candles and posters left in tribute to the two special forces officers who died rescuing the Adris. The couple are now in Tel Aviv; their bloodied home has been emptied of its belongings, a hollowed-out symbol of the horrors the town suffered.
Little in Ofakim has been repaired. On Ha-Tamar Street, most of the houses are still pockmarked with bullet holes, shot-up cars remain parked outside, and traditional Sukkot tents from the September holiday have not been taken down.
The Elkhazovs – Yuri, 55, Rosa, 52, and their children Elena, 25, and George, 23 – live across the road from the Adris. The family first realised something deeply frightening was happening on 7 October when a gunman carrying a rocket-propelled grenade and wearing the bright green insignia of Hamas rang the doorbell at about 7.30am. After seeing him through the intercom camera, they huddled behind the kitchen wall for 17 hours until the shooting was over, bullets piercing their windows and door.
On Wednesday afternoon, like the rest of the country, the Elkhazovs were glued to the television news. Rosa expressed anger and frustration at the world’s response to what is now known in Israel as Black Saturday.
“We came from the Soviet Union, but look at what happened in Dagestan.  We could never go back there,” she said, referring to the angry mob in the Muslim-majority Russian republic that rioted at an airport last week after rumours spread that a flight from Tel Aviv was bringing Jewish refugees. “There is nowhere else for Jews to go. The only country that stands with Israel is America.”
As she spoke, Israel’s Channel 12 cut to a story about Latin American countries breaking off diplomatic relations  and withdrawing ambassadors in protest at Israel’s military operations in Gaza.
Sderot, where Hamas took hostages in the local police station and engaged Israeli forces in a two-day battle before the IDF blew up the building, was evacuated three weeks ago; the town of 28,000 is now empty apart from street cats.
On a panoramic ridge facing west on the edge of town, home to a nursery school, Sderot’s residents used to gather during the four previous wars between Israel and Hamas since the group seized control of the strip in 2007. They had cheered and whistled as the bombs rained down on Gaza’s trapped civilians, sipping beers and settling in as though watching a fireworks display as the conflicts unfolded less than a mile away in Beit Hanoun, a town in the strip’s north-east corner.
The ridge, known to journalists as “the hill of shame”, on Wednesday afternoon only hosted a handful of television crews filming the aftermath of airstrikes and huge plumes of dust thrown up by the movement of Israeli tanks. The IDF continues to pummel the tiny territory in its mission to destroy Hamas.
The scene was quieter than previous days, but no less deadly: as Israeli troops move deeper into Gaza, the fighting has begun to shift to the ground, in what is likely to be gruelling house to house combat , complicated by the presence of thousands of civilians and Hamas’s vast network of tunnels.
A fire from an earlier airstrike that the IDF said hit a weapons depot was still burning, sending columns of black smoke into the orange Mediterranean sky; one Israeli cameraman, who said he was sympathetic to the plight of Gaza’s people, let out a long, sad sigh.
Israeli victory in Gaza remains an undefined – and unclear – possibility. The only certainty is more bloodshed in the days and weeks to come. Nothing here will ever be the same again.

Highlight: UN secretary general says situation ‘fast deteriorating into catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications’Israel-Hamas war – live updates
Body


Israeli forces and Hamas are fighting house-to-house battles along the length of the Gaza Strip, with devastating consequences for the civilian population amid a complete collapse in humanitarian relief.
As the war intensified on Wednesday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, invoked a rarely used clause in the UN charter to raise the issue on his own initiative before the security council, to warn that the conflict “may aggravate existing threats to international peace and security”.
“We are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system,” Guterres wrote in a letter to the council. “The situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region.”
He added: “Amid constant bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces, and without shelter or the essentials to survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible.
“An even worse situation could unfold, including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into neighboring countries.”
As the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been fighting their way through badly bomb-damaged urban areas in northern and southern Gaza, Hamas has increasingly relied on improvised bombs to inflict casualties and slow down the assault.
Gaza’s hospitals have reported a flood of civilian dead and injured, many of them women and children, as medical supplies dwindle, while the spread of ground combat to the south has stopped any delivery of humanitarian aid  much farther than the Rafah crossing point with Egypt.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 1,207 Palestinians had been killed since the collapse of a temporary ceasefire at the beginning of the month, and that 70% of the dead were women and children.
The ministry said more than 100 bodies were currently awaiting burial inside the Kamal Adwan hospital in northern Gaza, which it said was without fuel and was coming under fire. “The entire north of the Gaza Strip is left without health services,” Munir al-Bursh, the director, said. 
The focal points of the fighting over the past two days have been the Jabaliya refugee camp and the Shujai’iya district in northern Gaza, and Khan Younis and Bani Suheila in the south.
The IDF has taken control of most of the Salah al-Din Road, the main north-south highway running down the middle of the coastal strip.
On Wednesday morning, the IDF called on residents of Khan Younis to flee the city for safer areas, noting that there would be a pause until 2pm in the bombardment of Rafah, immediately to the south on the Egyptian border.
The UN and aid agencies say nowhere in Gaza is safe any more.  According to the UN, 1.87 million people, more than 80% of Gaza’s population, have left their homes. Many have had to flee shelter several times to avoid the Israeli advance.
The UN Human Rights Office said on Tuesday that “the pattern of attacks that target or impact on civilian infrastructure raises serious concerns about Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law and significantly raises the risk of atrocity crimes”.
The Norwegian Refugee Council said the Gaza war now ranked “amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age”.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, claimed that the IDF was winning the war and that more than half of Hamas’s battalion commanders had been killed.
“The ground shook in Khan Younis and Jabaliya. We have encircled them both. There is no place we cannot reach,” Netanyahu said on Tuesday. He said the IDF was winning every battle, but at “an unbearable price”.
The IDF reported seven casualties on Tuesday and two more on Wednesday morning. Since ground operations began, 84 IDF soldiers have been reported killed in the ground operation, many of them as a result of bombs and anti-tank missiles fired at close range.
“Palestinian militia fighters continued to use more sophisticated tactics to target Israeli forces throughout the Gaza Strip,” the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War  said in a report co-authored with the American Enterprise Institute’s critical threats project. It cited an incident on Tuesday in which Hamas’s military wing used explosives to bring down a house on top of Israeli soldiers in Khan Younis and detonated an armour-piercing shaped charge against an Israeli tank.
Hamas was also able to launch 15 rockets from Gaza hideouts on central and southern Israel on Tuesday.
The IDF said Khan Younis had become the main Hamas stronghold after the ground assault on the north began on 27 October, with four of the extremist movement’s 24 battalions based there.
Israeli commanders believe that the Hamas hierarchy, including its leader, Yahya Sinwar, could be hiding in the extensive tunnel network below the city. Sinwar was born in the Khan Younis refugee camp and late on Wednesday, Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the IDF were encircling the the Sinwar family home.
“Yesterday I said that our forces could reach anywhere in the Gaza Strip. Today they are encircling Sinwar’s house. His house may not be his fortress and he can escape but it’s only a matter of time before we get him,” Netanyahu said.
The Biden administration has continued to urge Israel to do more to limit civilian casualties. Martin Griffiths, the UN’s top aid official, said the IDF campaign in the south was just as devastating for the Palestinian population as its operations in the north, with US diplomacy making no difference to the outcome.
Officials from the US vice-president Kamala Harris’s office are in Israel for talks on what should happen to Gaza after the war, which was started by a Hamas rampage through Israeli villages that killed 1,200 people, more than two-thirds of them civilians, on 7 October.
Increasing evidence  is emerging of extreme sexual crimes committed by the Hamas attackers against female victims.
Washington has insisted there should be no long-term Israeli military presence in Gaza, but Netanyahu has claimed there is no option for his country’s security other than direct military control.
“Gaza must be demilitarised. And in order for Gaza to be demilitarised, there is only one force that can see to this demilitarisation – and that force is the IDF,” the prime minister said in a written statement on Tuesday.
“No international force can be responsible for this. We have seen what has happened in other places where they brought in international forces for the goal of demilitarisation. I am not prepared to close my eyes and accept any other arrangement.”

Highlight: Calls for independent inquiry as UN team visiting the wounded in Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital report seeing ‘large number of gunshot wounds’
Body


Israel is facing growing international pressure for an investigation after more than 100 Palestinians in Gaza were killed when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire on Thursday.
Israel said people died in a crush or were run over by aid lorries although it admitted its troops had opened fire on what it called a “mob”. But the head of a hospital in Gaza said 80% of injured people brought in had gunshot wounds.
On Friday, a UN team that visited some of the wounded in Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital saw a “large number of gunshot wounds”, UN chief Antonio Guterres’s spokesman said.
The hospital received 70 of the dead and treated more than 700 wounded, of whom around 200 were still there during the team’s visit, spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said.
“I’m not aware that our team examined the bodies of people who were killed. My understanding from what they saw in terms of the patients who were alive getting treatments is that there was a large number of gunshot wounds,” he said.
The UK called for an “urgent investigation and accountability”. In a statement, David Cameron, the foreign secretary, said: “The deaths of people in Gaza waiting for an aid convoy were horrific … this must not happen again.” Israel must allow more aid into Gaza, Lord Cameron added.
France called for an independent investigation into the circumstances of the disaster, and Germany said the Israeli army must fully explain what happened. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said: “Every effort must be made to investigate what happened and ensure transparency.”
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 112 people were killed and more than 750 others were injured as crowds rushed towards a convoy of trucks carrying food aid.
Accounts of what happened differed. Witnesses in Gaza and some of the injured said Israeli forces opened fire on the crowd, causing panic.
Dr Mohammed Salha, the acting director of al-Awda hospital in northern Gaza, told the Associated Press that 176 wounded were brought to the facility, of whom 142 had gunshot wounds. The other 34 showed injuries from a stampede.
An Israeli military spokesperson claimed “tens” of people were killed in a crush or run over by trucks as they tried to escape. He also said Israel Defense Forces troops had later “opened fire” in self-defence after feeling under threat, but that they did not target the convoy or the crowd.
R Adm Daniel Hagari said  : “Tens of Gazan residents were killed as a result of overcrowding, and the Palestinian trucks unfortunately ran over them during an attempt to escape.
“An IDF force that was securing the area passed by the crowd and opened fire only when they encountered danger, when the mob moved toward it in a manner that endangered the force.
“Contrary to accusations, we did not fire toward individuals seeking aid and we did not fire toward the humanitarian convoy from the ground nor from the air.”
Earlier, another Israeli military spokesperson appeared to give a different account of which forces had opened fire. Lt Col Peter Lerner said troops guarding a checkpoint into north Gaza were responsible.
“At the crossing point itself is where people approached the forces posing a threat and therefore the forces opened fire,” he told a press briefing. Asked for clarification, the Israeli military said Hagari’s statement was “the correct one”.
Despite a lack of clarity about the facts, international condemnation mounted on Friday. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said civilians had been “targeted by Israeli soldiers” and called for an immediate ceasefire.
“Deep indignation at the images coming from Gaza where civilians have been targeted by Israeli soldiers. I express my strongest condemnation of these shootings and call for truth, justice and respect for international law,” he posted on X. 
“The situation in Gaza is terrible. All civilian populations must be protected. A ceasefire must be implemented immediately to allow humanitarian aid to be distributed.” 
Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said she was shocked by reports of the incident. “People wanted relief supplies for themselves and their families and ended up dead. The reports from Gaza shock me. The Israeli army must fully explain how the mass panic and shooting could have happened,” she wrote on social media.
The White House said the deaths of 112 desperate people seeking food for their families were “tremendously alarming”. The state department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US was “urgently seeking additional information on exactly what took place” and not all the facts were known. He said Washington would be “pressing for answers”.
Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, said that at a closed-door emergency session of the UN security council the US had blocked a resolution put forward by Algeria that said the deaths were “due to opening fire by Israel forces”. 
He said: “This outrageous massacre is a testimony to the fact that as long as the security council is paralysed and vetoes [are cast] then it is costing the Palestinian people their lives.” Washington has three times blocked security council resolutions for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Joe Biden announced that the US will start airdrops of food and emergency supplies into Gaza  in the next few days, but critics suggested it represented no more than a gesture, which obscured Biden’s reluctance to use US leverage to force Israel to be more cooperative in the delivery of humanitarian aid.
“The loss of life is heartbreaking,” Biden said. “People are so desperate that innocent people got caught in a terrible war unable to feed their families and you saw the response when they tried to get aid in.”
Before news of the attack was widely reported on Friday, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) had said extreme hunger in north Gaza, which is getting even less aid than the south, was fuelling a “chaotic situation” around the few aid trucks approved to enter the area.
Philippe Lazzarini said the “deep level of distress and desperation prevailing in the north” was a “man-made” crisis, that could be easily reversed if Israeli authorities allowed in more aid, particularly food.
“We know the answer. We know what needs to be done,” he told journalists in Jerusalem. “You have about 300,000 people [in the north] right now, much fewer people in the north than you have in the south. Just open a crossing in the north [to let aid in], that’s it.”
Some major donors have suspended contributions to UNRWA since Israeli allegations a month ago that 12 of the agency’s employees had been involved in the Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the current conflict. A UN inquiry reported on Wednesday that it had yet to receive evidence from Israel to back up the allegations.
On Friday, the EU announced it would disburse €50m (£43m) of its funding for UNRWA immediately, with the remaining €32m to be paid in two further tranches, pending reforms and the completion of the investigation.
Speaking about Thursday’s deaths, Stéphane Séjourné, France’s minister for Europe and foreign affairs, told France Inter: “We will ask for explanations and there will have to be an independent probe to determine what happened. France calls things by their name.
“This applies when we designate Hamas as a terrorist group, but we must also call things by their name when there are atrocities in Gaza.”
If an investigation concluded that the Israeli shootings were a war crime, “then obviously this becomes a matter for the judiciary”, he said.
Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, said the “unacceptable” events underlined the “urgency of a ceasefire”, while the EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, expressed horror at “yet another carnage among civilians in Gaza desperate for humanitarian aid”.
Egypt said it still hoped that talks initiated by Qatar could agree on a ceasefire in Gaza before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in about 10 days’ time.
Thursday’s casualties added to a death toll in Gaza that the Hamas-run health ministry said had exceeded 30,000, mainly women and children.
The war began after the Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October that resulted in the deaths of nearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians. About 250 people were taken hostage.

Body


Good morning. For more than 80 days, a bloody conflict has been raging in Israel and Gaza. On 7 October Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israel, and gunmen broke through security barriers in the worst breach of the country’s defences in five decades – 1,200 Israelis were killed  and more than 200 were taken hostage. Harrowing reports have emerged of sexual violence against women, of torture and abuse of adults and children.
The response from Israel was swift and brutal, with the government promising a “mighty vengeance” against Hamas, vowing to destroy the militant group altogether. In the months since the attack, the Israeli military has unleashed one of the heaviest conventional bombing campaigns in history, according to one expert.  More than 20,400 people  have been killed, including nearly 8,000 children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, in the two and a half months since the bombardment began. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced; entire neighbourhoods have been reduced  to rubble. The UN has described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “ apocalyptic  ” and the World Food Programme has said that there is a “catastrophic hunger crisis”. Safe drinking water is desperately scarce , raising the risk of disease outbreaks.
The number of civilian deaths in this conflict has restarted the global conversation about the route to peace in the region, although to date there has been little consensus. I spoke with Guardian foreign correspondent Emma Graham-Harrison about the situation in Israel and the occupied territories before Hamas’ attacks, the big turning points of the war and the possible next steps. That’s right after the headlines.
                   In depth: The buildup to a conflict without a solution                   
Benjamin Netanyahu’s long-term strategy of containing Hamas was seemingly working for him. “Concerns about conditions in Gaza slipped down the international agenda. Even though it endured regular bombings and blockades and was often described as an open-air prison, there was less international focus on the small strip,” Emma Graham-Harrison says, and US-backed efforts to normalise relations with regional powers were enjoying increasing success. Israel thought Hamas had been “slightly defanged” as a threat to their country. “Netanyahu was perhaps too eager to believe his own policies had worked, and Hamas was focused more on the economic side of things, so no longer an existential threat to Israel despite a charter that calls for its destruction.”
This may go some way to explain why the Israeli government ignored significant internal and external intelligence warnings about Hamas’ plans.
Two days after the 7 October attack and Netanyahu’s declaration of all-out war, a complete siege on Gaza began. Water, food or fuel were not allowed into the strip. Within 10 days, various world leaders, including Joe Biden, visited Israel to show their support. It took a month and a half to negotiate a humanitarian pause to allow the exchange of 105 Israeli hostages for more than 240 Palestinians who were being held in Israeli prisons. The ceasefire collapsed however after eight days, and airstrikes recommenced.
***
                     Shifting international responses                   
Initially, some western governments were firm in their support of Israel. The US, Israel’s most important ally, has been steadfast in its support of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, saying it has a right to defend itself against Hamas. However, “the numbers of civilian casualties and the horrific levels of suffering”, Emma says, has changed the tenor of the conversation. When the war started, the population in Gaza had a certain level of resilience – they had their homes and access to food and water. “Now they are fleeing again, but this time people are hungry, massively traumatised and there are high levels of disease,” Emma says. “And I think you see this reality reflected in even Israel’s closest allies”. President Biden has recently begun ratcheting up his criticism of Israel, warning that it was beginning to lose support because of the “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza.
Other allies have tempered their support: Emmanuel Macron  has hardened his criticism of Israel’s military strategy, demanding that Israeli authorities “define more precisely” their aims in Gaza. He added that an acceptable response to a terrorist group was not “to bomb the entirety of civilian capabilities”. EU leaders have reportedly rejected requests from Netanyahu to lobby Egypt to open its borders to Palestinian refugees. Despite growing international pressure, Netanyahu recently said that the war “ isn’t close to finished  ”.
***
                     What are Israel’s long term plans?                   
Israel’s military strategy is to demilitarise Hamas by degrading its capabilities so that it cannot attack again. Netanyahu  has dismissed the prospect of the Palestinian Authority running Gaza, a suggestion from Biden, and has rejected the idea of foreign peacekeepers brokering a deal, insisting that only the Israeli army could be trusted to make sure that Gaza stays demilitarised. The only stated and clear military goal is to “destroy Hamas”. But this is not “an achievable military goal”, Emma says, because Hamas is an ideological organisation that operates beyond Gaza in practical and political terms.
Netanyahu has said that there is a chance the Israeli military would maintain  indefinite security control over Gaza after the war ends, which suggests that the plan is to reintroduce a form of extended Israeli occupation over the strip. Biden has warned Netanyahu against this strongly. “Israeli officials have also discussed the possibility of having a buffer zone in Gaza – as Gaza is really tiny already, taking away more land for this would be massively controversial,” Emma says.
Biden has warned Israel that “vengeance” is not a viable military strategy. He sees the danger in waging a war like this, as he remembers the Bush administration’s war in Afghanistan. “What you had was almost 20 years over which the Taliban grew stronger and stronger and reversed the original American military victory,” Emma says. “Biden clearly sees the danger in something similar happening in this conflict.”
***
                     Netanyahu’s precarious                     position                   
“Right from the beginning, it was clear that the vast majority of Israeli society  held Netanyahu responsible for the attack,” Emma says. Even though Netanyahu, the longest-serving leader in Israel’s history, has a reputation for being the ultimate political survivor, this latest war feels like the beginning of the end for his time in power. Many have said that thoughts of his political future have influenced the way that he has prosecuted the war: “Netanyahu presented himself as the strong man who would keep Israel safe. The question in his mind is: if he managed a war that destroyed Hamas, could he redeem himself to the Israeli public and somehow cling on?”
***
                     The humanitarian crisis                   
The scale of the crisis in Gaza has led to humanitarian organisations and the United Nations to issue unusually explicit statements on the conflict. “The strength of their statements in condemning the situation in Gaza is a reflection of how, even in the context of a world with many very brutal, complex and terrible wars, this is a particularly dire situation in terms of the level of humanitarian suffering,” Emma says.
Inside Israel though, there is little public pressure to curb the attacks on Gaza. Most people see the war as an existential campaign. When Emma asked one reservist about Biden’s warnings, and the military catastrophes in Afghanistan and Iraq, fed in part by civilian casualties from aerial bombing campaigns, he said: “British and American soldiers could go home, we don’t have anywhere else to go.”
As we go into 2024, no end is in sight. This conflict will probably continue, leaving in its wake a trail of unfathomable destruction and death.

Could the Israel-Gaza war spark a wider conflict involving the US, Iran or others?

Highlight: So far the risks of the horrific Gaza crisis escalating to a wider war remain low – but they can’t be ruled out entirely
Body


Soon after Hamas’s 7 October attack and Israel’s retaliatory bombing campaign in Gaza, pundits began debating the odds of escalation. For its part, the Biden administration has tried to prevent the fighting between Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from spreading to other areas of the Middle East, if only to spare the roughly 45,000 US troops based there from another ill-fated war.
“Escalation” lacks a singular meaning. For some, it connotes a vast increase in death and destruction after at least one warring party starts using weapons that are far more powerful than it had employed previously. For others, escalation refers to wars that spread because additional countries or armed groups decide to join the fighting.
Israel’s war in Gaza has already escalated in both these respects, albeit only to a limited extent.
The magnitude and scale of the firepower that the IDF has used in Gaza has increased substantially, even before its ground invasion began at the end of October. According to a recent estimate , 70% of Gaza’s homes and half of all other buildings are damaged or demolished. More than 22,000 residents have been killed and 85%  have been displaced from their homes – and within 90 days. The magnitude of the devastation has prompted comparisons to the Allied bombing of Dresden and Hamburg  during the second world war.
The Israel-Hamas war has also expanded to other places. There are daily skirmishes along the Israel-Lebanon border between Israel and the Iran-aligned Shia militia Hezbollah. Approximately 150,000 people  have fled northern Israel and southern Lebanon, and, despite American attempts at mediating a solution that would push Hezbollah further away from the border, the firefights continue. 
The region’s major powers have not entered the fray. But there are plausible scenarios in which they could
Furthermore, the IDF has been attacking Iranian proxies in Syrian-controlled territory, targeting air defense systems , weapons depots and even senior Iranian generals.  In Yemen, the Houthis, another Iranian-linked militia, have attacked Red Sea shipping lanes more than two dozen times, prompting the US to create an international maritime coalition to maintain freedom of navigation and, along with 11 other nations, to issue a warning  : cease or face the consequences.
Still, the region’s major powers have not entered the fray. But there are plausible scenarios in which they could.
One involves an Iranian attack on Israel, perhaps in response to increasing IDF strikes against Hezbollah or an Israeli military strike in Syria that kills numerous advisers or officers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Israel has already killed  several IRGC officers since the war in Gaza began, including, on Christmas Day, Sayyed Razi Mousavi , a general overseeing the supply of Iranian weapons to Hezbollah.
Another pathway to escalation is Iranian retaliation for an American attack on the Iran-backed, Yemen-based Houthis, an option that the Biden administration has reportedly considered.  Indeed, on 31 December, an American destroyer downed Houthi missiles that targeted a cargo ship in the Red Sea and then fired on Houthi boats that attacked the same vessel, killing the Houthi fighters onboard.
However, incidents like these are not likely to compel Iran to take direct aim at Israel or American warships. Iranian leaders understand that Israel sees it as that country’s biggest threat and would retaliate in force if Iran made the reckless decision to target its territory. Plus, Iran could not exclude the possibility that the US would attack if Israel were bogged down in a two-front war.
Above all else, Iranian leaders are rational actors concerned about preserving their state and will therefore avoid steps that could trigger a runaway spiral that drags their country into a war with Israel or the United States – one it would probably lose.
There’s no indication that pressure from ‘the street’ will force any major Arab country to intervene militarily to support Gazans
The war could also spread if Israel attacked Iran in order to stop its support for Hezbollah, particularly if the latter launched a fusillade of rockets and missiles on Israeli cities and towns from southern Lebanon. But in practice, Hezbollah has chosen a middle-ground strategy, engaging in localized attacks against Israeli military posts along the border but nevertheless avoiding strikes on a scale that could cause significant Israeli casualties and lead to a full-scale war that Lebanon can’t absorb. And the IDF has demonstrated ample capacity to punish Hezbollah without having to take the drastic step of also striking Iran directly.
The prospects of Arab countries entering the war are also slim. The huge death toll created by Israel’s relentless attacks on Gaza have produced outrage and sparked demonstrations  across the Arab world as well as mounting opposition  in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to the normalization of relations (past or prospective) with Israel.
Yet there’s no indication that pressure from “the street” will force any major Arab country to intervene militarily to support Gazans. Arab states want the war in Gaza to end as soon as possible, which direct Arab participation would probably prevent. Furthermore, some of these states, notably Egypt, have little sympathy for Hamas.
The war in Gaza is certainly horrifying, but the risks of it escalating remains low, even if they cannot be ruled out entirely.

Hundreds feared dead after blast at Gaza hospital as Biden set to fly in

Highlight: Health ministry run by Hamas says more than 500 were killed, while civil defence official puts figure at above 300Israel-Hamas war: latest updates
Body


Hundreds of people are reported to have died in a massive explosion at a hospital in Gaza City, on the eve of Joe Biden’s arrival for a visit that was intended to fend off the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and prevent the conflict escalating into a regional war.
The Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, claimed that more than 500 people had been killed an Israeli airstrike on the al-Ahli Arabi Baptist hospital which, if confirmed, would make it the deadliest single bombing of all the five wars Israel and Hamas have fought over Gaza. 
An official from the Gaza civil defence said more than 300 people had been killed in the blast.
The Israeli military denied responsibility, suggesting the hospital was hit by a rocket barrage launched by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group. Islamic Jihad also denied responsibility, saying: “The occupation is trying to cover for the horrifying crime and massacre they committed against civilians.”
The bombing of the hospital threw a dark shadow over Biden’s visit on Wednesday, which was already the most difficult and critical foreign trip of his presidency.
Late on Tuesday, Jordan cancelled a summit in Amman where Biden had been due to hold talks with King Abdullah, and the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, after the US president’s visit to Israel.
Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi told Al Jazeera the summit was cancelled because “there is no use in talking now about anything except stopping the war”.
The White House later issued a statement, saying: “After consulting with King Abdullah II of Jordan and in light of the days of mourning announced by President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, President Biden will postpone his travel to Jordan and the planned meeting with these two leaders and President Sisi of Egypt.”
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas had earlier pulled out of meeting, after declaring three days of national mourning.
In a statement, Abbas said: “What is taking place is genocide. We call on the international community to intervene immediately to stop this massacre. Silence is no longer acceptable.”
Protests broke out across the West Bank after the hospital blast, and in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, demonstrators threw rocks at the Palestinian security forces who fired on the crowds with stun grenades.
Biden was still scheduled to hold talks with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , seeking to show US solidarity with Israel in the wake of the 7 October Hamas attack which killed more than 1,300 Israelis, in the hope of deterring intervention from the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia from across the border with Lebanon.
At the same time, the US president was hoping to rein in Israeli retribution against Gaza and its 2.3 million population, who are under constant bombardment while running out of water, food and medical supplies. The UN says more than 3,000 Palestinians have died in the 10 days since the Hamas attack.
As a condition of Biden’s visit, Israel agreed to a humanitarian package which included corridors into Gaza for relief supplies and safe areas for Palestinian civilians. But on the eve of his arrival, the border with Egypt, where aid has been stockpiled, remained closed.
Gaza City is in northern Gaza, which Israel ordered to be evacuated of civilians ahead of a planned ground offensive, but many Palestinian residents refused to leave their homes or were unable to travel, including the patients at the al-Ahli hospital. It was packed with Gazans wounded by earlier airstrikes and those seeking shelter from the bombardment.
Over the past two days, the Israeli air force has also struck urban areas in Khan Younis and Rafah, both of which are in the south of the enclave, where Gazans were told to seek shelter.
The border crossing at Rafah, through which aid convoys are waiting to enter, was among the targets. The UN Relief and Works Agency, UNWRA, reported an airstrike on Tuesday on one of its schools in central Gaza, where families displaced from the north had sought refuge. Six people were reported to have been killed.
The UNWRA commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, called the bombing at the al-Maghazi refugee camp “outrageous” and warned the death toll was likely to rise.
“It again shows a flagrant disregard for the lives of civilians. No place is safe in Gaza any more, not even UNWRA facilities,” Lazzarini added.
Even before the blast at the Gaza hospital, the visit was a gamble for Biden in terms of his international reputation and his domestic standing before an election year. The US believed it had struck humanitarian agreements with Netanyahu’s government over the past two days but these did not come to fruition.
The president’s trip was announced by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, after more than seven hours of talks with Netanyahu and his national security cabinet. The Washington Post and Haaretz reported that the announcement was held back until the Israeli leadership agreed corridors for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza and the creation of safe areas for civilians that would not be bombed.
Blinken said Biden was coming “at a critical moment for Israel, for the region and for the world”.
He said Israel would brief Biden on its war aims and strategy, and on how it would conduct operations “in a way that minimises civilian casualties and enables humanitarian assistance to flow to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not benefit Hamas”.
Rishi Sunak is understood to be considering a visit to Israel, with sources saying it could be as early as this week. However, plans are still being drawn up and could change as a result of the situation on the ground, including the bombing of a hospital in Gaza.
Convoys of lorries carrying emergency food water and medical supplies are waiting on the Egyptian side of the border with Gaza waiting for the crossing point at Rafah to open, while Palestinians with foreign citizenship wait on the other side to leave the enclave. Egypt controls the border but requires Israeli agreement on what and who is allowed to pass through it.
By Tuesday evening, the gate had still not been opened, but the border post and nearby urban areas were hit by airstrikes. At least 49 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes that hit homes in Rafah and Khan Younis, Gaza’s interior ministry said.
The UN human rights office denounced the “appalling reports” of civilians being killed in southern Gaza where they had been told to flee for their own safety by the Israeli authorities. The office’s spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, appealed to Israel to avoid “indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks”.
Asked about airstrikes on Rafah, an Israeli military spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, said on Tuesday: “When we see a target, when we see something moving that is Hamas, we take care of it. It’s as simple as that.”
Israel has partly restored water supply to southern Gaza but the UN said it constituted only 4% of the normal flow into the territory. The lack of clean water and the presence of bodies under the rubble has brought fears of an epidemic. Hospitals are in a state of collapse in the absence of electricity and fuel for generators.
“We are overwhelmed. We’re running out of supplies. We have got to get supplies into the Gaza Strip. Time is of the essence here. The clock is ticking,” UNRWA spokesperson Juliette Touma told the BBC. 
Israel has amassed a large force around Gaza’s borders in preparation for a potential invasion, in the wake of the Hamas attack on 7 October. The extremist group is holding hostage 199 Israelis, including women and children, inside Gaza.
Standing alongside the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Tuesday, Netanyahu compared Hamas to the Nazis. “The savagery that we witnessed perpetrated by the Hamas murderers coming out of Gaza were the worst crimes committed against Jews since the Holocaust,” he said.
The Israeli ground assault has been held back during Blinken’s diplomatic initiative and amid fears that it could trigger an offensive by Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border.
Briefing reporters on Tuesday, Hecht suggested a ground assault was not an inevitability. “We are preparing for the next stages of war,” he said. “We haven’t said what it will be. Everyone is talking about a ground offensive but maybe it will be something different.”
The UN human rights office said on Tuesday that Israel’s order to evacuate northern Gaza could constitute the forcible transfer of civilians, which is a crime under international humanitarian law. The UN has said more than a million people have been forced from their homes.
“We are concerned that this order, combined with the imposition of a complete siege of Gaza, may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians in breach of international law,” the UN’s Shamdasani said.
In his talks with Israeli and Arab leaders this week, Biden will also be seeking to ward off a wider regional conflagration after threats from Hezbollah and its backer, Iran.
Israel has ordered the evacuation of 28 villages to create a 2km security zone on its Lebanese border, as Netanyahu warned Israelis they should prepare for a long battle.
“And I have a message for Iran and Hezbollah: don’t test us in the north. Don’t make the same mistake you once made. Because today the price you will pay will be much heavier,” the prime minister told the Knesset on Monday.
The US has deployed two aircraft carrier groups to the region and about 2,000 US troops had been put on alert for non-combat roles in possible support of Israel.
The White House has asked Congress to approve more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in additional assistance for both Israel and Ukraine.

Al Jazeera faces ‘security threat’ ban as Israel passes new law

Highlight: Benjamin Netanyahu says after approval of bill he will ‘act immediately … to stop channel’s activities’
Body


Israeli legislators have approved a bill paving the way for a ban on Al Jazeera  and other international news outlets perceived as posing a threat to security.
After the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, promised to take prompt measures to force the end of Al Jazeera’s operations within the country, parliament granted senior ministers authority to shut down foreign news networks.
Netanyahu confirmed the decision on social media, declaring that the Qatari satellite television station will no longer be aired in Israel and vowing immediate action under the new law.
“Al Jazeera will no longer be broadcast from Israel,” Netanyahu wrote in a post on X after the law was approved in its final readings on Monday. “I intend to act immediately in accordance with the new law to stop the channel’s activity.”
Telecommunications minister, Shlomo Karhi, announced that the closure of Al Jazeera was imminent.
Al Jazeera condemned Netanyahu’s remarks, calling them “a dangerous and ridiculous lie” and saying they were the prime minister’s justification “for the ongoing assault” on the media network and press freedom. In a statement, the network vowed to persist in its reporting with “boldness and professionalism”.
White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre expressed concern about the ban.
“We believe in the freedom of the press. It is critical. It is critically important, and the United States supports the critically important work journalists do around the world, and that includes those who are reporting on the conflict in Gaza,” Jean-Pierre told reporters.
“So, we believe that work is important. The freedom of the press is important. And if those reports are true, it is concerning to us.”
Al Jazeera, which has been fiercely critical of Israel’s military operation in Gaza , has previously accused Israel of systematically targeting its offices and personnel.
Karhi accused Al Jazeera of encouraging hostilities against Israel.
“It is impossible to tolerate a media outlet, with press credentials from the government press office and with offices in Israel, acting from within against us, certainly in wartime,” he said.
This is not the first time Israel has threatened the use of emergency regulations to crack down on Al Jazeera’s operations in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.
In mid-October, Israel’s government approved wartime regulations permitting the temporary closure of foreign media outlets that were viewed as posing a threat to the nation’s interests.
At that time, Karhi said he anticipated that the measures would be directed at Al Jazeera, which has been broadcasting live from Gaza during theconflict with Israel.
Several press freedom organisations criticised the moves to close down Al Jazeera and other media entities.
Israel has frequently clashed with Al Jazeera, which maintains offices in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
In 2017, Israel vowed to expel Al Jazeera’s journalists, shut down its offices and prevent it from broadcasting.
The then communications minister, Ayoob Kara, accused the network of fostering violence, particularly in relation to issues concerning al-Aqsa mosque.
In 2022, Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh was killed by Israeli forces while reporting in Jenin, located in the occupied West Bank.
In January, Al Jazeera accused Israel of the targeted killing of two of its journalists in Gaza.
Hamza Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuria were killed while on assignment for Al Jazeera, while a third freelancer, Hazem Rajab, was wounded.
Dahdouh was the eldest son of Al Jazeera’s bureau chief in Gaza, Wael Dahdouh,  whose wife, two other children and a grandson were killed  by a previous Israeli strike in October.
According to Reporters Without Borders, 103 Palestinian journalists have been killed by the Israel Defense Forces since Hamas launched its attack on Israel, sparking the war in Gaza.

The Israeli death toll  after the surprise attack by the militant group Hamas on communities in the country’s south on Saturday has risen to at least 800, as Israel has declared a “complete siege” of Gaza. In Gaza,officials have reported at least 560 deaths.
                                                                                        Israel’s death toll has risen to at least 800, with 2,616 injured, according to Israeli authorities.                                                                                          The death toll in Gaza has risen to 560, with 2,900 injured, according to Palestinian authorities.                                                                                          Gaza fired rockets toward southern and central Israel.  There are injuries.                                                                                          Israel has declared a “complete siege” of Gaza , cutting it off from water and power supplies, and launched hundreds of strikes on the Palestinian enclave, as Hamas claimed Israeli bombings had killed hostages held there.                                                                                          Israeli authorities said they restored control in southern communities but that some Hamas militants might still be present inside Israel.                                                                                          Israeli forces exchanged fire with armed individuals in northern Israel who crossed the border from Lebanon. Militants were killed, while Israeli soldiers were wounded.                                                                                          Israeli combat helicopters carrying out strikes inside Lebanon, and Israelis living                         near the Lebanese border were told to seek shelter until further notice.                                                                                          Spokesperson for the IDF, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, said “almost 48 hours into the fighting … the situation in Israel is a dire one”. “It is by far the worst day in Israeli history. Never before have so many Israelis been killed by one single thing on one day.”                                                                                          Israeli rescue service Zaka said that its paramedics have removed approximately 260 bodies from a music festival                          that was attacked by Hamas. 
 Videos posted online showed festival goers running frantically and getting into cars after the attacks.                                                                                          Numerous members of the UN security council denounced Hamas on Sunday but the United States regretted the lack of unanimity. At an emergency session, the United States and Israel urged strong condemnation of the Palestinian Islamists. “There are a good number of countries that condemned the Hamas  attacks. They’re obviously not all,” senior US diplomat Robert Wood told reporters after the closed-door session. “You could probably figure out one of them without me saying anything,” said Wood, in a clear allusion to Russia.                                                                                          The Israeli military has said there is no concrete evidence of Iranian involvement in the Hamas attack from Gaza, after denials issued by the Iranian foreign ministry.                                                                                          Iran helped Hamas plan its surprise attacks against Israel  over the weekend, according to senior members of Hamas and Hezbollah who spoke to the Wall Street Journal.  Details of the operation were refined during several meetings in Beirut attended by IRGC officers and representatives of four Iran-backed militant groups, including Hamas, which holds power in Gaza , and Hezbollah, they said. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken has however said that Washington had not seen any evidence that Iran was behind the attack.                                                                 An Israeli airstrike has killed 19 members of a Palestinian family in a Gaza refugee camp, according to the Associated Press.                                                                                          The permanent observer mission of the state of Palestine to the UN has issued a response on Sunday to the Israel-Hamas war, saying that “these developments did not occur in a vacuum”.  “They are preceded by the killing this year of hundreds of Palestinians … and preceded by decades of Israel’s unrelenting military raids on Palestinian villages, towns, cities and refugee camps,” it said.                                                                                          Nine American citizens are confirmed to have been killed  in the violence following Hamas’s attacks on Israel                          at the weekend, the US state department says. Matthew Miller, a US state department spokesperson, said: “At this time, we can confirm the deaths of nine US citizens. We can confirm that there are unaccounted-for US citizens, and we are working with our Israeli partners to determine their whereabouts.”                                                                                          The BBC reported that at least 10 British citizens were dead or missing.                         France confirmed the deaths of two of its citizens, and there were reports that as many as nine French people were missing, dead or taken hostage. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said two Ukrainians had also been killed.                                                                                          Protesters gathered in the US cities of New York, Chicago and Washington DC as renewed conflict in Israel  and Gaza sparked outpourings of support and anger. In New York, around a thousand pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators took to Times Square on Sunday to voice their opposition to Hamas  attacks on Israel and IDF counterattacks on Gaza.                                                                                          The United States defence secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford to head its “strike group” of forces as it sails to the eastern Mediterranean to be closer to Israel  following Hamas’s “heinous” attacks.  “In addition, the United States government will be rapidly providing the Israel Defense Forces with additional equipment and resources, including munitions,” he added.                                                                                          Joe Biden told the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , on Sunday that “additional assistance for the Israeli Defense Forces is now on its way to Israel with more to follow over the coming days.”  After the call between the two leaders, the White House released a statement, saying: “The President … pledged his full support for the Government and people of Israel in the face of an unprecedented and appalling assault by Hamas terrorists.”                                                                                          The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has pledged  to provide diplomatic, intelligence or security support to Israel if requested after attacks by Hamas, as he prepared to chair an emergency meeting of Cobra. He has told the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu , on Sunday that Britain stands with Israel “unequivocally”.                                                                                          More airlines have suspended flights into Tel Aviv following Hamas’s attacks on Israel  over the weekend.  Those airlines include Delta, American Airlines, United and Air France.                                                                                          The UN’s World Food Programme has called on the establishment of humanitarian corridors to deliver food supplies into Gaza following Israeli airstrikes in response to Hamas’s attacks.  “As the conflict intensifies, civilians, including vulnerable children and families, face mounting challenges in accessing essential food supplies,” the WFP said.                                                                                          The UK Foreign Office has issued a travel advisory advising against all but essential travel to Israel and the Palestinian territories.   British nationals requiring consular assistance should call the following numbers: +972 (0)3 725 1222 or +972 (2) 5414100, the advisory said.                                                                                           The Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has said Iran supports the Palestinians’ right to self-defence, Agence France-Presse reports.  “Iran supports the legitimate defence of the Palestinian nation,” Raisi said on Iranian state television.                                                                                          Mexican foreign secretary Alicia Bárcena has announced that two Mexican citizens, a man and a woman, have allegedly been taken hostage by Hamas  in Gaza on Saturday.  “We are in contact with authorities in Israel  and family members to provide follow-up, support and care,” Bárcena said.                                                                                          Eight hundred Hamas targets were struck in Gaza with hundreds of Hamas fighters killed, Reuters reports an Israeli military spokesperson saying.  Dozens more had been captured, added the spokesperson.                                                                                          The UN’s relief agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said thousands of people were sheltering in its 44 schools around Gaza and food distribution for more than 112,000 families had had to be put on hold.                                                                                          The German government said on Sunday it was reviewing its hundreds of millions of euros of aid for Palestinians after the militant group Hamas attacked Israel.   Development minister Svenja Schulze said the government had always been careful to check that the money was only used for peaceful ends. “But these attacks on Israel mark a terrible fracture,” she said.                                                                                          Up to 100 Israeli hostages, including women and children, may have been taken into Gaza by Hamas, hugely complicating any Israeli military operation to free them.  The whereabouts and fate of the captives has become one of the most pressing issues for military planners.

Highlight: Evidence from conflict zone suggests the IDF is seeking to encircle Gaza City as the military and Hamas report fierce initial battlesIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Israel’s ground invasion of the northern Gaza Strip began on Friday evening, an urban warfare operation that is likely to be lengthy, fraught with danger for its military and Palestinian civilians and whose ultimate goals remain uncertain.
It began more than three weeks after Hamas’s surprising and brutal cross-border attack of 7 October, in which 1,400 Israelis were killed, and comes amid what the monitoring group Airwars says is an aerial bombardment that “far outpaces” the number of bombs dropped in “the deadliest months” of the US-led war against Islamic State.
Israeli forces have already fired more than 8,000 munitions into north and south Gaza, according to the country’s military, in an attempt to soften up Hamas resistance, but which has also led to thousands of casualties, including dozens at the Jabalia camp in the north of the strip that was hit on Tuesday.
Video and pictures released by the Israel Defence Force on Tuesday show soldiers and tanks entering a shattered urban terrain , with the Israeli military and Hamas describing fighting fierce battles, although these are likely to be only initial skirmishes for strategic position.
Verifiable information is hard to come by, but the limited evidence emerging from the combat zone suggests that the IDF is seeking to encircle Gaza City, probably as a prelude to trying to capture what was the capital of the strip.
Tanks were filmed having advanced to cut the main north-south Salah al-Din road south of Gaza  City on Monday, although subsequent reports suggested the road had reopened, potentially to allow a porous encirclement, where fighters and civilians are allowed to escape a looming siege, in theory making it easier for the attackers.
Urban warfare is the most dangerous form of fighting, and as the near year-long battle of Bakhmut in Ukraine showed, even a ruined landscape still confers significant advantages to the defenders. But Hamas has gone further, building a sophisticated, cement reinforced tunnel network underground , from which fighters can endure the most sustained aerial attack, knowing that an Israeli invasion may one day come.
A battle in three dimensions is complex enough, but Ben Barry, an analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said that Israel’s military had also been set contradictory political goals by the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Saturday, Netanyahu said the invasion’s objective was to destroy “Hamas’s governing and military capabilities and to bring the hostages home”. The first part may imply an aggressive assault with less regard for casualties, where Hamas tunnels are mined by armed Israeli robots, or simply sealed off.
But freeing hostages, Barry argues, requires a more measured approach where the 240 people held by Hamas are located and rescued in what are likely to be complex individual operations. “You would need good intelligence and to proceed carefully,” Barry added.
Another question is how Hamas will respond. Its military strength and capacity is unclear, but its leaders have choices. Conventionally, Israel measures the size of the Hamas fighting force at about 30,000, and while about 1,200 were killed during the October attack, the impact of the Israeli bombardment is unclear.
If its fighters remain cohesive, there is the option of fighting for Gaza City and trying to inflict immediate casualties on the Israeli military. Alternatively, they could hang back, retreating to the southern part of Gaza and taking hostages with them if possible, and allowing Israel to take control of the north relatively quickly.
Israel retains formidable conventional military advantages: air superiority and a well-trained, modern fighting force with 400 tanks at the ready and more in storage. Its standing army is estimated to number 126,000, strengthened by the call-up of 360,000 reservists, but its military has to guard the north from Hezbollah in Lebanon and contend with a deteriorating security situation on the West Bank.
By contrast, Hamas has limited equipment. A video it released  of its fighters showed they were armed with rocket-propelled grenades.
If the initial plan is to seize Gaza City in the north, which the IDF believes is at the heart of Hamas’s operation, the fighting is likely to be hard on both sides, complicated by how many civilians choose to remain in a congested urban setting where civilian and Hamas military objects are frequently located side by side or intertwined.
The destruction of urban areas will be almost unavoidable – a study in the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  observed that during the battle of Raqqa, recaptured from IS in Syria 2017, 80% of buildings were destroyed in 90 days of fighting. At least 1,600 civilians were killed in that battle, significantly fewer than the 8,000 Palestinians declared dead by Gaza’s health ministry in the fighting so far.
A more significant complication is the sheer danger and uncertainty in the fighting that is to unfold. A fortnight ago it appeared the Middle East was on the brink of wider unrest, when Hamas claimed the Israeli air force had bombed al-Ahli Arab hospital; in fact the blast that authorities in Gaza say killed 471 civilians was probably caused by a missile launched from inside the territory.
Israel says that Hamas’s main command centre operates from underneath the overcrowded Dar al-Shifa hospital  in Gaza City, where doctors say that 19,000 wounded people remain and another 14,000 are seeking shelter, despite calls from the IDF for it to be evacuated. Hamas officials deny Israel’s claim, but sites such as the Shifa hospital will, at the very least, be encompassed by the fighting in the weeks to come.

Highlight: Whereabouts and fate of captives is one of the most pressing issues for military plannersIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


More than 100 Israeli hostages, including women and children, may have been taken into Gaza by Hamas, hugely complicating any Israeli military operation to free them.
Amid shocking images of terrified Israeli soldiers and civilians – some bloodied, others hooded and with their hands tied – being marched away by Hamas militants, the whereabouts and fate of the captives has become one of the most pressing issues for military planners.
While a spokesperson for the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, has said only that a “significant number” of Israeli civilians and soldiers are being held hostage, that number is believed to be in the dozens, with some Israeli news outlets speculating that more than 100 have been taken hostage.
Officials in the US and UK were urgently investigating claims that several Americans and one British citizen may have been captured.
According to reports, while most hostages were taken by Palestinian armed factions, some Palestinian civilians who also entered Israel may have taken captives too.
Among those reported as missing is Jake Marlowe – a British citizen who was attending a music festival in the south of Israel. His family have been unable to reach him since Hamas infiltrators attacked the event.
Conricus said some hostages were alive while others were presumed dead, in line with the practice of Gaza’s militant factions of taking human remains to exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
“These are numbers that were up until now unimaginable,” said Conricus. “This will shape the future of this war.”
Israeli TV news aired a stream of accounts from the relatives of captive or missing Israelis, who begged for assistance amid a fog of uncertainty surrounding the fate of their loved ones.
Among them was Ora Kuperstein who was interviewed on Israeli Channel 12 and said her family was looking for her nephew, 21-year-old Bar, who was working at the rave that was attacked by Hamas, and taken into Gaza. “Nobody has told us anything. Nobody is helping us. It’s chaos,” she said. “His parents know nothing. He got there on Friday evening. From the videos we’ve seen he was next to the guards, who were the first to get shot.
“He had no weapon, they took him with other young people.”
Videos circulating online appear to show Israelis in the hands of Hamas fighters both during their seizure from communities in southern Israel and later in locations in Gaza, with one geolocated video showing a truck being driven through crowds on the Gaza Strip with Israeli hostages.
Another video circulating appeared to show an Israeli child in the coastal strip, while yet another appeared to show a wounded Israeli soldier in Gaza being beaten by bystanders.
Despite the displaying of the hostages on their arrival in Gaza, the working assumption is that they will have been quickly dispersed amid fears they will be used as human shields in the likelihood of an Israeli ground assault.
IDF officials have announced they are compiling a “situational picture” for locating the captives, both soldiers and civilians, saying: “Some families have already received messages about their loved ones.”
An Egyptian official said Israel had already sought help from Cairo to ensure the safety of the hostages, and that Egypt’s intelligence chief had contacted Hamas and the smaller but more radical Islamic Jihad group, which also took part in the incursion, to seek information.
The official said Palestinian leaders claimed that they did not yet have a “full picture” of hostages, but said those who were brought into Gaza were taken to secure locations across the territory. “It’s clear that they have a big number – several dozens,” said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to brief media.
The sheer scale of the hostage crisis confronting Israel suggests that the experience of the country’s most high profile former hostage in Gaza, Gilad Shalit , who was held for more than five years after being taken prisoner in 2006 is unlikely to be indicative of how they will be treated.
While Hamas has probably based its judgments over how Israeli society will react to a large hostage-taking on the precedent of Shalit, who was exchanged for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, it is far from a given that Israel, reeling from the shock of Hamas’s assault and after declaring war , will see its hands as being tied by Hamas in its military response.
While Conricus spoke of the hostages as “shaping the future of the war”, military planning for a land incursion into Gaza will also be coloured by other considerations. One factor will be the awareness in the Israeli military command that in launching Saturday’s surprise attack , Hamas’s own planning in all likelihood was that it would prompt Israeli forces to enter built-up urban areas of Gaza.
Hamas’s thinking – rightly or wrongly – is that based on previous rounds of fighting in Gaza, its prepared positions, including tunnel systems, level the playing field with Israeli forces, with armour vulnerable to anti-tank missiles and mines at close quarters.
In particular the IDF will be mindful of its experiences during the 2014 Gaza war when 13 soldiers were killed in one night of heavy urban fighting in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City after soldiers were ambushed with an anti-tank mine and machine gun fire.
While Israeli forces have leaned heavily on their overwhelming advantage in air power and artillery placed on the higher ground to the east of Gaza, one of the enduring lessons of the periodic bouts of fighting is how Hamas, including its leadership, has always managed to emerge after the end of periods of conflict able to begin rearming almost immediately.
In part that is because of the geography of the Gaza Strip. With its dense and maze-like urban landscape, the Israeli military’s tactic of approaching through more open rural areas of farmland in the north, centre and south of Gaza – where tanks are able to operate more easily – are now familiar to both sides.
Over the years of fighting, Hamas has also shown its ability to adapt its approach to Israeli tactics, applying lessons from elsewhere, including those learned from other groups under Iran’s tutelage such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.
That message was underlined by Hamas itself. “We are prepared for all options, including all-out war,” said Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy head of the Hamas political bureau. “We are ready to do whatever is necessary for the dignity and freedom of our people.”

Israel is losing the war against Hamas – but Netanyahu and his government will never admit it

Highlight: The official narrative has been that Hamas is weakened, but in reality the IDF’s doctrine of massive force is failingPaul Rogers is emeritus professor of peace studies at Bradford University
Body


Until recently the war narrative on Gaza has been very largely controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the country’s ministry of defence. Israel’s international reputation may have plummeted with the killing of more than 20,000 Palestinians, the wounding of more than 50,000 and the destruction of much of Gaza, but the IDF could still sell a plausible narrative of a severely weakened Hamas, even claiming that the war in northern Gaza was largely complete, and success in southern Gaza would follow before too long.
The narrative was helped by severe difficulties for the few journalists still operating in Gaza, including the risk to their personal safety, while the international press corps was stuck in Jerusalem and dependent on IDF sources for much of their information.
That changed as a different picture began to emerge. First there was a lack of evidence to support  the IDF’s claim of a Hamas headquarters under al-Shifa hospital, then the IDF could not identify the location of the Israeli hostages, despite having some of the world’s most advanced intelligence.
Very recently there have been two further incidents. On 12 December, there was a skilful triple ambush staged by Hamas paramilitaries in a part of Gaza supposedly controlled by Israeli forces. An IDF unit was ambushed and took casualties. Further troops were sent to aid that unit, and they were then ambushed, as were reinforcements.
Ten IDF soldiers were reported killed and other seriously wounded, but it was their seniority that counted, including  as it did a colonel and three majors from the elite Golani Brigade. That Hamas, supposedly decimated and with thousands of troops already killed, could mount such an operation anywhere in Gaza, let alone a district reportedly already under IDF control, should  raise doubts about  the idea that Israel is making substantial progress in the war.
A further indication came a few days later, when three Israeli hostages succeeded in getting away from their captors, only to be killed  by IDF soldiers, even though shirtless and carrying a white flag. What has since made that worse, and is causing considerable anger in Israel, is that calls from the hostages were picked up  by an audio-equipped IDF search-dog five days before they were killed.
There are other, wider indications of the IDF’s problems. Official casualty figures have shown more than 460  military personnel killed in Gaza, Israel and the occupied West Bank and about 1,900 wounded. But other sources suggest far greater numbers of wounded. 
Ten days ago, Israel’s leading daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, published information obtained from the ministry of defence’s rehabilitation department. The head of the department, Limor Luria, was reported as saying that more than 2,000 IDF soldiers had been registered as disabled  since the conflict began – with 58% of all those it had treated suffering from severe injuries to their hands and feet – suggesting a far higher casualty toll than the official figure. Meanwhile, the Times of Israel has reported  the number of injured IDF soldiers, Israel Police and other security forces as 6,125. There have also been a number of friendly fire casualties, with the same paper reporting 20 out of 105 deaths due to such fire or accidents during fighting.
Overall, the IDF is still following the well-rehearsed Dahiya  doctrine of massive force in responding to irregular war, causing extensive social and economic damage, undermining the will of the insurgents to fight while deterring future threats to Israel’s security. But it is going badly wrong. Criticism is coming from unexpected quarters, including from  the former UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, who has warned of an impact lasting 50 years. Even the Biden administration is becoming thoroughly uneasy at what is unfolding, yet Benjamin Netanyahu and the war cabinet are determined to continue for as long as they can.
It is worth recognising why. The 7 October attacks and the brutality involved struck Israel’s assumption of security to the core, which means that the great majority of Israeli Jews have so far continued to support Netanyahu’s response. Even that, though, is fraying and is made worse by the killing of the three hostages by IDF troops.
An effect of all this is that the IDF commanders are coming under huge pressure to succeed, and will go as far as the war cabinet will allow. Many of those commanders are highly intelligent if inevitably single-minded people, and will now know that for all Netanyahu’s rhetoric, Hamas, or at least Hamas’s ideas, cannot be defeated by military force. They also know that while talks are stalling , pressure from the families of hostages may soon result in another humanitarian pause. Therefore, their aim will be to damage Hamas as much as they can, as quickly as they can, while they can, whatever the cost to Palestinians. For evidence of this approach, witness this week’s intense air raids.
What makes that possible is Netanyahu’s dependence on an extremist minority of religious fundamentalists and trenchant Zionists in his government. They would not have anything like the wider support in Israel were it not for the tragedy of 7 October, yet they are doing more and more harm to Israel’s long-term security. Not only does Israel risk becoming a pariah state, even among its allies, but it will also fuel a generation of radical opposition from a reconstituted Hamas or its inevitable successor.
It needs saving from itself, but that will depend, more than anything, on Joe Biden and the people around him. Perhaps pushed on by the rapidly changing public mood in western Europe, they must recognise their role in bringing an immediate end to this conflict.
 This article was amended on 22 December 2023 to remove an unverified casualty figure for military personnel, and to include an equivalent figure from a different source.

Australia has abstained from casting a vote in a UN resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza, arguing it was “incomplete” because it did not mention Hamas as the perpetrator of the 7 October attack.
On Friday, the United Nations general assembly overwhelmingly called for an “immediate, durable and sustainable humanitarian truce” between Israel  and Hamas and demanded unhindered aid access to the besieged Gaza Strip.
The motion, drafted by Jordan, is not binding but carries political weight, with 120 nations voting in favour and only 14 – including the US and Israel – voting no. Meanwhile, 45 countries – including Australia, the UK, Germany, India and Canada – abstained from voting.
James Larsen, Australia’s representative to the United Nations, told the assembly that Australia agreed with the aims of the resolution and repeated Australia’s calls for a humanitarian pause to allow food, water and medicine to reach Gazans.
“We agree with the central proposition, that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire and human suffering is widespread and unacceptable,” he said.
But, Larsen said, Australia abstained from voting with “disappointment” because the resolution as drafted was “incomplete” because it did not name Hamas.

“The resolution did not recognise terror group Hamas as the perpetrator of the 7 October attack,” he said. “And Australia again explicitly calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages.”
The US also took issue with Hamas not being named in the resolution.
“It is outrageous that this resolution fails to name the perpetrators of the October 7th terrorist attacks: Hamas. Hamas. It is outrageous,” said the United States ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “Another key word missing in this resolution is: hostage.”
The resolution did call for the “immediate and unconditional release” of all civilians illegally held captive and demanded their safety and humane treatment, and condemned attacks on both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.
Australia’s decision to abstain has drawn fierce criticism. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, wrote on X (formerly Twitter): “Labor’s failure to vote with most of the world for a ceasefire is unacceptable.
“Labor needs to work towards peace, not war, in Gaza and the Middle East.”
The former Australian of the year and human rights advocate Craig Forster said Australia’s decision to abstain was “deeply, deeply sad”.
“News overnight that Australia abstained from a United Nations vote on the protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations is deplorable and deeply, deeply sad,” he said. “Commitment to international human rights and humanitarian law by Australia should be a given.”
The president of the Australian Palestinian Network, Nasser Mashni, also expressed dismay, saying the situation in Gaza is “catastrophic”.
“We are deeply disappointed Australia didn’t join the majority of the world in calling for what the people of Gaza desperately need,” he told Guardian Australia.
But Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said the UN should be calling for Hamas to surrender and the immediate release of the 222 Israeli hostages.
“Hamas has used truces in the past to replenish its arsenal. Every effort must be made to avoid civilian casualties in the ensuing war but the delusion that peace for Palestinians and Israelis is possible while Hamas is in power have been dispelled,’ he said.
“Palestinians deserve peace and safety and I deeply hope that the complete destruction of Hamas can finally put Israelis and Palestinians on the path to mutual recognition and peace.”
On Wednesday Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, called for “humanitarian pauses” in the Israel-Hamas war to allow essential supplies to “reach people in desperate need”.
“There has been access in recent days but nowhere near enough,” Wong said.
The UN resolution demands essential supplies be allowed into the Gaza  Strip and humanitarian workers have sustained access. It also stressed the need “to urgently establish a mechanism to ensure the protection of the Palestinian civilian population”.
Larsen told the general assembly Australia believes Israel’s right to exist can be affirmed without denying the aspiration of Palestinian people for statehood.
“We can affirm Israel’s right to defend itself, while also saying the way it does so matters,’ he said. “It matters for innocent civilians, who should not pay for horrors perpetrated by Hamas.
“And it matters for Israel’s ongoing security, which would face grave threats if conflict were to spill over across the region.”
Another UN vote attempting to condemn Hamas by name, and demanding an immediate release of hostages, was passed by 88 to 55, with Australia’s support, but failed to win the required two-thirds majority.

After six months, the war in Gaza is making Israel a pariah state

Body


Six months after the attacks of 7 October, and it’s time to count again the losses. They begin with the dead, with the 1,200 Israelis killed on that day and the estimated 33,000 Palestinians killed in the 182 days since. Some are sceptical of a Gaza figure that comes from a health ministry controlled by Hamas – while others suspect those numbers are, if anything, an underestimate, fearing that many thousands of uncounted Palestinian dead  lie under the rubble.
Then you have to reckon with those who were neither Israeli nor Palestinian, but outsiders who wanted to help and paid for that kindness with their lives – like six of the seven aid workers of World Central Kitchen  who were killed in three separate strikes from an Israeli drone this week.
But the tally of suffering does not end with the dead. It must include the pain of maimed and orphaned Palestinians, and of the 134 Israelis and others who have spent the past six months held hostage, many presumed to be imprisoned underground, with some tortured and sexually abused. 
The accounting of all that agony could last a lifetime and still it would not be enough. But any audit of this vicious half-year has to go wider still. The impact of the six-day war of 1967 is felt to this day, marking out the territories that remain under Israeli occupation. So what might be the lasting consequences of this six-month war? Who will emerge weaker and who stronger?
At first glance, you might assume Hamas would be disappointed by the results of its murderous efforts on 7 October. It had high ambitions: this week, a former Gaza official revealed  that the Hamas leaders were so convinced “that they were going to bring Israel down that they started dividing Israel into cantons, for the day after the conquest”. (They approached that ex-official to be a canton governor.) It did not pan out that way. Instead, Hamas’s rampage through southern Israel brought hellfire down on the people of Gaza, provoking an Israeli response that has left as much as  2% of the population dead and displaced the rest.
That scale of destruction won’t unduly trouble the zealots at the top of Hamas: the death of others is a sacrifice they are willing to make. But they will lament the losses among their own: an estimated 10,000 men, more than a third of their fighting force, along with three battalion commanders and seven members of the ruling political bureau, according to Michael Milshtein, the former senior intelligence officer widely regarded as Israel’s foremost expert on Hamas. The group has lost or used up almost all its arsenal of rockets – and, its greatest disappointment, the action failed to spark the wider regional onslaught against Israel  it dreamed of. 
And yet, Hamas will regard itself as anything but the loser in the six-month war. For all of Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of the “total defeat” of Hamas, it is still standing. Most of its key Gaza leaders remain alive and present; it is still “the prominent actor in Gaza”, Milshtein told me, adding that there is no realistic prospect any of the mooted alternatives will take its place. Despite all that the people of Gaza have endured, their approval of Hamas’s role in the war stands at 70% , according to the veteran Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki.
Still, the chief source of the satisfaction Hamas will be feeling, six months on from 7 October, lies elsewhere – not in what’s happened to it, but rather in what’s happened to its mortal enemy: Israel.
In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, the country enjoyed widespread – though not universal – sympathy, especially from western governments. Joe Biden rushed to Tel Aviv , to sit with the bereaved and to stand with their leaders. But look at the picture now.
Israel has never been more isolated. The president of the United States, which for decades has been Israel’s genuinely indispensable ally, is so “ outraged  ” – his word – at Israel’s killing of those aid workers that on Thursday night he issued a barely veiled ultimatum to the country’s prime minister: do as I say or there will be no more arms. The threat is hardly empty: other western allies have already cut off weapons supplies  or are considering it.
Those governments are responding to a global mood they can no longer ignore. Because it’s not Israel’s perennial critics who are denouncing the country; it’s Israel’s friends. In Britain, the WCK killings saw Lord Ricketts , a former UK national security adviser who earlier served Tony Blair, demand a suspension of arms sales. His call was echoed throughout the Conservative party, in a letter from hundreds of lawyers, including several former justices of the supreme court , and by usually pro-Israel, right-leaning voices in the media. When you’ve lost Nick Ferrari , who can regularly be seen acting as MC at major UK Jewish charity events, you know you’re alone. 
Some in Israel will hope the current outrage is narrowly focused on Monday’s appalling incident. But that’s not quite right. For one thing, the conduct that led to those seven deaths is hardly a one-off – it’s just that this time the victims were not all Palestinian. As the much-admired defence analyst Amos Harel wrote in Haaretz this week, the WCK killings are “ a symptom of a broader phenomenon  ” in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), a carelessness or worse “when it comes to shooting near civilians” and “a serious discipline problem” that has led to “many violations of the laws of war”.
For six months, Israel has asked for the world’s understanding, trying to explain that it faces an exceptional enemy – one that hides underground, among and underneath a civilian population, and thinks nothing of firing rockets and missiles from hospitals, schools and mosques. For that reason, foreign governments have granted Israel a rare patience. But that has now run out. And much of it comes down to the decisions Israel took not on combat, but on aid.
Even those allies who, like Biden, accepted that Israel’s war on Hamas would come at an unbearably heavy price could see no logic or justification in a pattern of restrictions and obstacles that inflicts suffering not on Hamas, but on ordinary Palestinians. Anger at the shortages of food and medicine, at the warnings of an avoidable famine, reached breaking point following Monday’s killings. After Biden’s demarche, Netanyahu promised to change and to open new aid crossings into Gaza  – though there was a promise of a “flood” of aid from Israel  last month, and it never came.
The result is that Israel, whose founders longed to be a light unto the nations, stands today as a leper among the nations. Many Israelis are barely aware of the change: their media don’t show the war the rest of the world sees and deplores. They are focused instead on the threatened retaliation from Tehran, which could come at any moment after Israel’s assassination of two Iranian generals in Damascus  earlier this week, and the looming peril of Hezbollah’s arsenal across the northern border. And, frozen by the failure to bring the hostages home – the focus of growing anti-Netanyahu protests  – they remain caught in the trauma of 7 October, replaying the horror of that day, the deadliest in Israel’s history, over and over again. 
I don’t blame the Israeli public for that. But I do blame their leaders. Even if they did nothing to address the root causes of the conflict, their job was to transcend the rage and terror of that moment, to think calmly and strategically even amid the panic. To realise in that moment that their fight was with Hamas, not the entire population of Gaza. Instead, they have sown hatred in the hearts of a new generation, and they have made lonely a country that cannot function alone.
So, no, there are no winners in this dreadful war. But Hamas can enjoy a wicked smile of satisfaction: it laid a deadly trap  – and Benjamin Netanyahu led Israel right into it.

Body


US forces were targeted in three attacks in Iraq on Thursday but suffered no casualties, security sources have said, in the most geographically widespread series of strikes on US assets in a single day since the Israel-Hamas conflict started.
Spokespeople for the US embassy in Baghdad and US-led international forces stationed in Iraq did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A joint patrol of US forces and the Iraqi counter-terrorism service was targeted by an explosive device near the northern city of Mosul, causing damage to a vehicle but no casualties, two security sources said.
Armed drones also targeted the al-Harir airbase in Erbil and the Ain al-Asad airbase west of Baghdad, both of which house US and international forces. The drones were downed by air defences and caused no casualties, security sources said.
A statement from Iraqi Kurdistan’s counter-terrorism service, which differs to the federal Iraqi service, said attacks by drones at the al-Harir airbase caused a fire at one of its fuel depots. It said the base had been evacuated of US-led forces on 20 October.
US-led troops have been attacked at least 40 times in Iraq and Syria since early October over Israel’s devastating attack on Gaza in retaliation for Hamas militants’ 7 October attack on Israel.
Forty-five US soldiers have been injured, US officials say.
Washington blames the attacks on groups backed by Iran and says Tehran is ultimately responsible, a claim which Tehran denies, saying groups engaging in the attacks were doing so on their own accord.
Iran-backed militias in Iraq have publicly stated that US assets will continue to be targeted as long as the US backs Israel in its war on Gaza.
The latest attacks come after the White House said on Thursday the US military had struck targets in Syria to destroy weaponry and deter Iranian-backed separatist groups from targeting American personnel in the region.
The US has occasionally carried out retaliatory strikes against Iranian-backed forces in the region after they attack American forces, including a strike on 26 October.
The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said in statement that Wednesday’s strikes were conducted by two F-15 fighters and were in response to the recent attacks against US forces.
Austin said the attacks must stop. “If attacks by Iran’s proxies against US forces continue, we will not hesitate to take further necessary measures to protect our people,” he said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday’s strike killed nine people affiliated with Iran-backed groups in Syria, a toll that could not be independently confirmed.
Reuters has reported that the US military was taking new measures to protect its Middle East forces during the increase in attacks by suspected Iran-backed groups, and was leaving open the possibility of evacuating military families if needed.
The measures include increasing patrols, restricting access to base facilities and boosting intelligence collection, including through drone and other surveillance operations, officials said.

Body


Eight Labour frontbenchers including Jess Phillips have resigned as Keir Starmer was hit by a major rebellion over a vote for a ceasefire in Gaza.
Overall, 56 Labour MPs voted for an amendment to the king’s speech brought by the Scottish National party, a major blow to the Labour leader’s attempts to keep unity over the Israel-Hamas war.
Labour officials had said in advance that any frontbencher doing so would be sacked for backing the amendment, which called explicitly for a ceasefire.
Phillips, Afzal Khan, Yasmin Qureshi and Paula Barker quit their frontbench roles on Wednesday night after voting for the amendment and defying the whip.
Rachel Hopkins, Sarah Owen, Naz Shah, and Andy Slaughter were sacked by the Labour leader after the vote. Mary Foy, Angela Rayner’s parliamentary private secretary (PPS), and Dan Carden, another PPS, have also left the frontbench.
As votes closed, Starmer said he regretted that party colleagues had not backed his position.
“Alongside leaders around the world, I have called throughout for adherence to international law, for humanitarian pauses to allow access for aid, food, water, utilities and medicine, and have expressed our concerns at the scale of civilian casualties.”
He added: “Leadership is about doing the right thing. That is the least the public deserves. And the least that leadership demands.”
The Labour leader had hoped to avert a rebellion with a separate amendment criticising Israel’s military actions but stopping short of calling for a ceasefire, and instructed his members to abstain on the SNP motion. Many chose to vote for both, however, amid anger among Labour members over how Starmer has handled the issue.
MPs voted 293 to 125, a majority of 168, to reject the SNP’s amendment, with Qureshi, Khan and Barker quitting before the vote.
Phillips, the most high-profile frontbencher, said it was with a “heavy heart” that she was quitting.
“This week has been one of the toughest weeks in politics since I entered parliament,” the Birmingham Yardley MP said in her resignation letter.
“I have tried to do everything that I could to make it so that this was not the outcome, but it is with a heavy heart that I will be leaving my post in the shadow Home Office team.
“On this occasion I must vote with my constituents, my head, and my heart which has felt as if it were breaking over the last four weeks with the horror of the situation in Israel and Palestine.
“I can see no route where the current military action does anything but put at risk the hope of peace and security for anyone in the region now and in the future.”
Shah (Bradford West) and Khan (Manchester Gorton) told fellow MPs in the Commons of their intention to vote for an immediate ceasefire. Helen Hayes (Dulwich and West Norwood) said she was going to vote for the amendment but decided to abstain.
After the vote, Shah said: “We have to make our positions clear … our job in parliament is to use our platforms to convince people, which is what I did in the chamber earlier.
“I’m not alone in calling for a ceasefire … my inbox has thousands of emails about a ceasefire,” she told Sky News. “This is an issue that the British public feel strongly about.
“At some point there will be a ceasefire. Had we called for a ceasefire yesterday, 144 children might still be alive. A child dies every 10 minutes.”
Earlier, she told the Commons: “Our values push us to do better and this is why, despite all the risk to our personal positions, we must do what is right.
“Whilst it may be a matter of convention to follow our closest ally, the US, in interests of foreign policy, it is a matter of conscience to step away from our closest ally in the interests of peace.
“We know that eventually there will be a ceasefire in this current crisis – every war ends with a cessation of hostilities.
“The question is not if there will be a ceasefire but when. For the people of Palestine, every minute, every hour, every day we wait is another orphan, another grieving mother and another family wiped out.”
The Guardian understands that Khan notified Starmer of his intention to vote for a ceasefire not long before he spoke in the Commons. It is understood Khan was asked if there was anything the leadership could do to change his mind.
Khan told the Commons: “If we had a ceasefire yesterday, 144 Gazan children would still be alive today. Israel has already crossed every red line imaginable and broken international humanitarian laws.” 
Starmer has faced a growing backlash over his position on the conflict since he gave an interview last month  in which he appeared to suggest Israel had the right to withhold water and power from civilians in Gaza.
He attempted to heal those divisions in a recent speech at the Chatham House thinktank, in which he urged Israel to adhere to international law but stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.
Starmer spent much of Wednesday locked in meetings with his shadow ministers as he attempted to minimise the expected rebellion.

Highlight: Heavy bombing continues, while Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has shown unparalleled ‘morality’ in its conduct in Gaza Israel-Gaza war – live updates
Body


At least 100 people have been killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, as the three-month-old conflict between Israel and Hamas rolls into the new year with no end in sight and only tentative Israeli government plans for discussing the day after the war is over.
The Hamas-run territory’s health authority said about 48 people were killed overnight on Sunday in heavy Israeli bombing of Gaza City, where pockets of fierce fighting are ongoing despite claims by the Israel Defense Forces that the north of the blockaded exclave is largely under Israeli operational control.
Another strike killed 20 people sheltering at al-Aqsa University in the west of Gaza City, witnesses said.
In the southern half of Gaza, areas previously identified as evacuation zones for the strip’s population of 2.3 million, about 85% of whom have fled their homes, have been heavily attacked with airstrikes and artillery over the past week as Israel broadens its ground operation.
Israel is now targeting Nuseirat, Maghazi and Bureij, a belt of overcrowded and poorly serviced camps in the centre of the strip built to house Palestinian refugees who fled their homes during the 1948 war over Israel’s creation. About 35 people were killed by bombardment of the area on Sunday.
“They were innocent people,” Hussein Siam, whose relatives were among the dead in a strike on the central neighbourhood of Zawayda, told the Associated Press. “Israeli warplanes bombarded the whole family.”
The camps’ populations have swelled with hundreds of thousands of newly displaced people since the war broke out after Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, in which the militant group killed 1,140 people and seized up to another 250 as hostages.
Rear Adm Daniel Hagari, the chief military spokesperson, said late on Sunday that Israel was withdrawing some forces from Gaza as part of its “smart management” of the war. He did not say how many, and held out the possibility they would return at a later point in the war.
Israeli media said up to five brigades, numbering thousands of soldiers, would be withdrawn, but it was not immediately clear if it represented a normal troop rotation or a new phase in the fighting. Hagari also said some reservists would return to civilian life to bolster Israel’s wartime economy.
Israel’s retaliatory war has killed about 21,800 people, injured another 55,000 and left approximately half of Gaza’s housing stock in ruins from bombings and ground fighting.
New estimates suggest that a quarter of Gaza’s population could die within a year from preventable diseases owing to a lack of sanitation, the collapse of the health system and hunger as desperate families weather the winter conditions in tents and makeshift shelters.
On Sunday, the Israeli foreign minister said the country was prepared to let ships deliver aid to the Gaza Strip immediately as part of a proposed sea corridor from Cyprus, a plan first proposed in November.
The Israeli military said on Sunday it had killed around a dozen enemy fighters in multiple ground battles across Gaza and it was homing in on the southern town of Khan Younis, where it believes senior Hamas officials are hiding. 
Israel has vowed to continue the war effort until “total victory” over Hamas, despite the growing casualty toll and international pressure for a ceasefire, including from the country’s most important ally, the US. Its war goals seem to be slipping away: troops are bogged down in ground fighting, senior Hamas leadership figures have not been killed, and Hamas has retained its ability to fire rockets at Israel.
On Sunday the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel had displayed unparalleled “morality” in its conduct in Gaza. He rejected a case filed by South Africa  at the international court of justice on Friday alleging that Israel was committing genocidal acts in Gaza.
The threat of a wider war looms large over the region, as skirmishes with the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah intensify on Israel’s northern boundary with Lebanon.
The US military said on Sunday that its forces had shot and killed several Iran-backed Houthi rebels  from Yemen when they tried to attack a cargo ship in the Red Sea, a serious escalation in Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes that the fundamentalist group says are in solidarity with Palestine. Washington has assembled a multinational naval taskforce to deter such attacks.
For now there seems little hope of even a temporary break in the fighting in Gaza, even after Egypt hosted Hamas leaders for talks last week and pushed plans for a staged break in the war involving a second release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners before an eventual ceasefire.
The US news outlet Axios and the Israeli website Ynet, both citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that Qatari mediators had told Israel that Hamas was prepared to resume talks on new hostage releases in exchange for a ceasefire.
Netanyahu, when asked about the process on Saturday, said Hamas had been “giving all kinds of ultimatums that we didn’t accept”. “We are seeing a certain shift [but] I don’t want to create an expectation,” he said, without elaborating.
Since 7 October, the normally fractious country has somewhat united, but that solidarity is showing signs of waning. Saturday night’s weekly protests in Tel Aviv aimed at putting pressure on the government to prioritise the release of the estimated 129 hostages still in Hamas captivity were joined this week by thousands of people protesting against Netanyahu and his government.
Israel is deeply divided over the longtime leader’s suitability for high office, as well as by this year’s controversial judicial overhaul, which could help him evade corruption charges he denies.
What happens to Gaza when Israel declares that the war is over is still unclear. Netanyahu has reportedly repeatedly refused to hold meetings, or has cancelled scheduled meetings, with security officials on discussing the “day after”, which are now set for Tuesday.

Highlight: Staff say situation at Nasser hospital ‘catastrophic’ as Israeli airstrikes hit metres away
Body


Israeli forces have advanced further into southern Gaza, with airstrikes and close-combat fighting nearing areas crowded with more than a million people who have sought refuge from fighting and destruction across the rest of the territory.
The prospect of major operations taking place in terrain with such a dense and vulnerable population is “deeply concerning”, say aid officials, who fear Gaza’s largest remaining hospital may have to be closed or evacuated.
Witnesses reported the sound of ground combat and explosions early on Friday in the west of Khan Younis, the main city in the south of Gaza, where Israel says many members and leaders of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas are hiding.
Medical staff said the fighting had come within metres of Nasser hospital, the biggest hospital still partly working in Gaza, over the past week. It has been receiving hundreds of wounded patients every day since the fighting shifted to the south last month. There are fears it could be forced to close because of Israeli bombardments and evacuation orders.
The Palestinian Red Crescent also reported “intense” artillery fire near the al-Amal hospital, while Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said 77 people were killed and dozens injured overnight.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is fighting its farthest south so far in the campaign. Soldiers had “eliminated dozens of terrorists in close-quarters combat and with the assistance of tank fire and air support”, officials said. Israeli officials have accused Hamas fighters of operating from Nasser hospital, which staff deny.
So far, the conflict has displaced roughly 85% of Gaza’s 2.4 million people. Many fled to Khan Younis and Rafah after Israel ordered civilians in the north to evacuate at the beginning of the war. They are packed into UN-run shelters, where food, water, fuel and medical care are limited.
Others are living in crowded private apartments, makeshift camps, under plastic sheeting pegged to poles on wasteland, or even on roads.
Aid officials who have visited Gaza say the crowding is almost unprecedented. Aid convoys have difficulty travelling along roads half-blocked by displaced families, and a journey that might have taken 10 minutes takes an hour.
Israeli officials say they try to avoid civilian casualties and issue evacuation orders designed to clear areas of residents before they attack. They accuse Hamas of using the population as a human shield. Hamas denies the charge.
Analysts in Israel say securing control of Khan Younis and Rafah is essential to achieve its war aims of destroying the military capabilities of Hamas and freeing more than 132 hostages abducted by the group in the 7 October attacks. About half of the 240 hostages seized by Hamas were freed in November during a short-lived ceasefire in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Some of those remaining hostages are thought to have been killed.
Many of the hostages are thought to be held in Khan Younis, possibly in tunnels below the city. Control of Rafah is seen as essential to cutting off Hamas from its supply routes from Egypt, the analysts said.
The prospect of a major Israeli assault in or near Rafah, a town on the border with Egypt that has become a refuge for almost a million displaced people, has alarmed humanitarian officials.
“Everybody is deeply, deeply anxious. Many have been displaced multiple times. People don’t see anywhere else to go. There is no real shelter anywhere else,” said Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, shortly after returning from a three-day visit to Gaza earlier this week.
Attempts are being made to reopen al-Shifa hospital, Gaza’s largest, which became the centre of a fierce propaganda war last year when Israel was accused of deliberately targeting the site. Israeli officials denied this, and said Hamas had built a command complex under the hospital and used its facilities.
The hospital, which the World Health Organization described as “a death zone” after it largely ceased operations after raids and occupation by Israeli troops in November, has restarted basic services.
Dr Marwan Abu Saada, the director of surgery at al-Shifa hospital, said he was hoping to open an ICU next week and that some basic services had been restored but that fuel, power and medicine were still in very short supply. “The major oxygen generators are destroyed so we are relying on cylinders,” he said.
Residents of Khan Younis described heavy fighting and intense bombardment in the north and east of the city and, for the first time, in the west on Thursday, where they said tanks had advanced to carry out a raid before withdrawing.
“What is happening in Khan Younis now is complete madness: the occupation bombards the city in all directions, from the air and the ground too,” said Abu El-Abed. The 45-year-old lives in Khan Younis after being displaced several times with his family of seven since leaving Gaza City in the north earlier in the war.
Leo Cans, the MSF head of mission for Palestine, said the situation at the Nasser hospital there was “catastrophic”. Fighting had come “very close” and an airstrike 150 metres from the hospital had killed eight people and injured 80 on Monday, he said.
The IDF confirmed on Thursday that it had removed bodies from An Namsawi cemetery near Nasser hospital, after reports that the graveyard had been destroyed by tanks and graves emptied. The IDF told broadcaster CNN  it had taken the bodies to identify whether any Israeli hostages were among them.
Footage also emerged on Thursday of Israeli troops blowing up the main campus of a university outside Gaza City in a controlled detonation – one of multiple universities they have destroyed.
The video, apparently taken by drone, showed a giant explosion engulfing the complex of buildings of al-Israa University.
The university, a private institution founded in 2014, said in a statement that its main building for graduate studies and bachelor’s colleges were destroyed. It said Israeli forces seized the complex 70 days ago and used it as a base. The Israeli army had no immediate comment.
In a briefing note, the UN said the explosion had taken place on Wednesday and said reports suggested it had “been used by the Israeli military as a military base and an ad hoc detention facility for interrogating Palestinian detainees before their transfer to an unknown location.”
A US state department spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said at a press briefing that Washington had raised the issue of the destruction of the university with Israel.
Elsewhere in Gaza, where a communications blackout entered a sixth day on Thursday, hindering rescue and relief efforts, medics said an Israeli airstrike on a home killed 16 people, half of them children, in the southern Gaza town of Rafah.
The war began when Hamas launched bloody attacks on Israel on 7 October that killed 1,200, mostly civilians.
A total of 24,620 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Gaza since – according to the territory’s health ministry – with thousands more thought to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Tens of thousands more have been wounded.
Reuters reported that a strike had wiped out a branch of the Zemeli family in the early hours of Thursday. “Yesterday, I was playing with the children over there. They have all died,” Mahmoud al-Zameli, 10, who lived next door and was a cousin to some of those who died, told the news wire. “I’m the only one still alive.”

Highlight: IDF says no damage or casualties caused after Lebanese militant group launches explosives at Safed baseMiddle East crisis – live updates
Body


Israel and Hezbollah edged closer towards full scale war on Tuesday, as the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group launched explosive drones at a key Israeli command base, declaring the attack part of its response to recent high-level Israeli assassinations in Lebanon.
Hezbollah announced it had launched “a number of explosive attack drones” at the Israeli northern military command base in Safed, the first time it has targeted the site.
As air raid sirens sounded across northern Israel on Tuesday, Israeli aircraft, drones and artillery struck multiple targets inside southern Lebanon, including a strike on a car during the funeral of a senior commander in the group’s elite Radwan force who had been killed the day before.
Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati – a Sunni businessman and politician who describes himself as “liberal” and is not part of Hezbollah – said that while his country was open to negotiations, it was being threatened with war.
“We seek permanent stability and call for a lasting peaceful solution,” said Mikati. “But in return we receive warnings through international envoys about a war on Lebanon,” he added, in reference to reported threats from Israel passed through foreign diplomats. “The position I repeat to these delegates is: do you support the idea of destruction? Is what is happening in Gaza acceptable?”
Hezbollah cited the killings of Wissam al-Tawil, a senior figure in the group, on Monday and Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas deputy chief, last week in its statement about the strike on the Safed base. Both killings took place on Lebanese soil.
Hezbollah is both a political party with ministers in the Lebanese cabinet and a militant movement with forces that are stronger than the national army. Lebanon has a power-sharing system with key roles divided up along sectarian lines.
Hezbollah said it also attacked at least six Israeli military posts along the border on Tuesday.
Israeli media reports and video footage posted on social media confirmed that at least one drone had landed inside the area of the Safed base.
Hezbollah announced that several had been launched. The drone appeared to have landed in an open area of the base close to a car park, with smoke from the explosion visible in some footage.
The Israeli army confirmed that a “hostile aircraft” had come down at one of its bases in the north and said that “no injuries or damage were reported”.
The border violence has forced tens of thousands of people to flee on both sides and raised fears the conflict could increase.
Israel has said it was giving a chance for diplomacy to prevent Hezbollah firing on people living in its north and to push Hezbollah back from the border, warning that the Israeli army would otherwise take action to achieve these aims.
However, Israel has launched a series of highly provocative attacks against targets in Lebanon in the past week, including the high-profile assassination of Arouri, the first strike on the Lebanese capital Beirut since 2006.
According to reports, the man killed at the funeral on Tuesday was Ali Hussein Barji, the commander of Hezbollah’s aerial forces in southern Lebanon. Israeli media said he had directed the Safed attack.
The killing took place as hundreds of Hezbollah supporters attended Tawil’s funeral procession, the group’s yellow flag draped over his coffin.
Tawil was regarded as an important figure in Hezbollah. He was involved in the abduction of Israeli soldiers, which triggered the group’s last war with Israel in 2006, as well as high-calibre operations in Syria. He had also “directed numerous operations” against Israeli forces since the Gaza war began, Hezbollah said.
The escalating violence came as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, tours the Middle East  in an attempt to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas from spreading regionally.
In a pointed warning, the Hezbollah deputy leader, Naim Qassem, said in a televised speech on Tuesday that his group did not want to expand the war from Lebanon, “but if Israel expands [it], the response is inevitable to the maximum extent required to deter Israel”.
Qassem added that Israel’s wave of targeted killings “cannot lead to a phase of retreat but rather to a push forward for the resistance”.
Earlier on Tuesday, an Israeli drone strike hit a car in southern Lebanon, some 10km from the border, killing three people inside it, security officials in the area and the state news agency said. Sources did not immediately identify those killed.
The Safed strike was the second to hit a significant Israeli military location in recent days after an attack on the Mount Meron airbase on Saturday, which caused significant damage.
A sharp escalation of violence between Israel and Hezbollah is fuelling fears that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza is in danger of spreading across the region.
Tuesday’s attacks, including several relatively far from the immediate border area, have underlined the rising tensions along the frontier since Hezbollah started attacking Israeli military posts a day after the 7 October assault on southern Israel by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas.
Hezbollah has said that by keeping Israel’s northern front active, it is helping to reduce pressure on Hamas in Gaza.

Highlight: In today’s newsletter: We pick through the data on the humanitarian catastrophe afflicting the Palestinian people Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition
Body


Good morning. Last night, Jason Burke reported  new warnings that Israel’s campaign in Gaza could last for a year – and even if the intensity of the conflict diminishes, that promises an ever-worsening humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinian civilians.
What, exactly, does “humanitarian catastrophe” mean? Pictures  and video  tell part of the story, as do personal accounts  and on-the-ground reporting.  To understand the scale of the crisis, it’s also helpful to understand the numbers. Even then, we might struggle to grasp what they are telling us: a single figure, which could be subject to challenge, can end up confusing or incomprehensible, and stripped of the accumulated human experience that it seeks to represent.
Today’s newsletter is an attempt at summarising some of the most robust information available about what’s happened in Gaza since 7 October – and to make sense of the numbers through context and comparison. Here are the headlines.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            Health inequality  | More than 1 million people in England died prematurely in the decade after 2011 owing to a combination of poverty, austerity and Covid, according to new research by one of the UK’s leading public health experts.  Sir Michael Marmot, who leads the Institute of Health Equity, called the findings evidence of “a shocking political failure”.
                                            Conservatives | The Conservatives face defeat at the next election after leaving the country in a worse state than in 2010, a senior Tory MP has said.  Danny Kruger, who was recorded making the comments at a private event in October, told the Guardian last night: “Either we remember the people we work for, or we face obliteration”.
                                            Post Office  | Victims of the Horizon scandal could be exonerated under plans being considered by the government , Rishi Sunak has said. The prime minister’s intervention on Sunday follows an ITV drama highlighting the scandal of Post Office operators who were wrongly convicted because of faulty computer software in their branches.
                                            US politics  | The US defence secretary has said he takes “full responsibility” after he was hospitalised without the knowledge of his deputy or President Joe Biden , in a break from normal practice. Lloyd Austin was first admitted on 22 December for a day before returning to hospital last Monday, with Biden and other senior White House officials not becoming aware of his admission until Thursday.
                                            Golden Globes | Last summer’s Barbenheimer phenomenon continued into the Golden Globes on Sunday night , with Barbie taking home best cinematic and box office achievement and Oppenheimer best drama. Oppenheimer led the way in the movie categories with five awards, while the last series Succession dominated the TV awards with four. See the red carpet fashion  and a list of the winners. 
                   In depth: The statistics that cut through the fog of war                   
The situation in Gaza over the last three months has been so chaotic that much of the data available comes with some sort of asterisk: it might be incomplete, or out of date, or drawn from a source that is claimed to be unreliable.
But on even the most frequently disputed point – casualty figures from Gaza’s Hamas-run ministry of health – there are few plausible critiques of the broad scale of what is being shown. And in many cases, the numbers published by the UN, independent aid agencies and others are likely to be at the low end of the possible range. So it is reasonable to view the picture presented by these sources as a conservative account of the situation, rather than conclude that the reality is hopelessly occluded by the fog of war.
Here are some details on specific aspects of the crisis.
***
                     Deaths                   
Gaza’s ministry of health says that at least 22,835 Palestinians had been killed  by yesterday, with another 58,416 reportedly injured. That figure does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but an estimated 70% are women and children. 7,000 more are reportedly missing and most are likely dead.
Israel’s final count  for Hamas’s 7 October massacre is 1,139: 685 Israeli civilians, 373 members of the security forces, and 71 foreigners. Deaths in Israel since then bring the total to about 1,200. 36 of the victims were children. The Israeli military says that 174 soldiers have been killed in Gaza, and 1,023 injured.
Because Gaza’s ministry of health (MoH) is run by Hamas, the tally it provides has been repeatedly questioned by Israel. But last month, when the MoH figure stood at 15,899 , a senior Israeli official confirmed  a reported Israeli estimate of 5,000 dead Hamas militants and roughly twice as many civilians, giving a similar total of 15,000. (An IDF spokesperson called that ratio  of two civilians to one combatant “tremendously positive”.) The MoH’s track record  across multiple conflicts is broadly consistent with other sources: for example, after a short war between Israel and Hamas in 2014, it gave a figure of 2,310 dead, while the UN later arrived at an estimate of 2,251 and Israel put it at 2,125.
The 22,835 dead represent about one in a hundred of Gaza’s total population. They have been killed at a rate of just under 250 a day (an average that has come down a bit in the last few weeks). It is not known exactly how many of those killed were combatants, but Israel’s own ratio would suggest that on average, more than 160 civilians have died each day.
That is a much faster rate than in other broadly comparable recent conflicts. The US-led coalition fighting Islamic State in Raqqa  killed 20 civilians a day during a four-month offensive, the BBC reported , while the nine-month battle for Mosul between US-backed Iraqi forces and IS killed fewer than 40 civilians a day. 
***
                     Internal displacement                   
Because of the scale of the crisis, it is hard to maintain precise figures. But by the end of the year, the UN Palestinian relief agency, UNRWA, estimated that  1.9 million people had been internally displaced by the war in Gaza – nearly 85% of the population.
Many have been forced to move multiple times as the focus of the IDF campaign shifts. About 1.4 million people are sheltering in UNRWA facilities, with most of the rest staying with friends, family, or strangers, or sleeping rough. About a million people – half of Gaza’s population – are now living in and around the southern border settlement of Rafah. About 280,000 lived there before the war began. The Council on Foreign Relations estimated that by early December, only about 1,100 people  had been allowed to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing to Egypt.
To rank the situation in Gaza among the world’s most pressing refugee crises may be moot – but the numbers do suggest that the crisis there bears comparison to those in Sudan and Syria. In Sudan, the International Organisation for Migration says that  just under 6 million of a population of 48 million have been displaced by the war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces, which started in April – a much lower percentage of the whole population, but a much higher raw number. The biggest refugee crisis of recent years is the one that unfolded during Syria’s civil war: of a pre-war population of 22 million, 14 million have been forced to flee their homes  over 12 years, and 6.8 million remain internally displaced with millions more abroad.
***
                     Destruction                   
Figures from the government media office in Gaza cited by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  (OCHA) estimate that about 65,000 residential units have been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable. Another 290,000 have been damaged. That means that about half a million people have no home to return to.
Analysis of satellite data cited by the Associated Press  suggests that about two-thirds of all structures in the north of Gaza have been destroyed, and about a quarter in the southern Khan Younis area. Across the whole territory, about 33% of buildings have been destroyed. The AP said that the rate of devastation was worse than either the razing of Aleppo in Syria or Russia’s bombing of Mariupol. 
That is a reflection of the intensity of the IDF campaign. Data from conflict-tracking group Airwars  suggests that the US-led coalition against IS in Iraq carried out 15,000 strikes between 2014 and 2017; the Israeli military has carried out 22,000 in Gaza in less than three months.
***
                     Critical infrastructure                   
While 500,000 people have no home to return to, many more will remain displaced because of the scale of the devastation of Gaza’s crucial public facilities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that 23 of 36 hospitals had been rendered completely inoperable  by 3 January, with a previous count of 3,500 beds down to 1,400 by 10 December  amid vastly increased need.
Gaza’s education system has also been severely compromised  : 104 schools have either been destroyed or sustained major damage. In total, about 70% of school buildings have been damaged – and those still standing are largely being used to shelter internally displaced people.
Meanwhile, water production stood at 7% of the pre-war supply on 30 December, and there is only one shower for every 4,500 people and one toilet for every 220. Those conditions make the spread of disease a very urgent problem: for example, the WHO said on 21 December  that more than 100,000 cases of diarrhoea had been reported since mid-October, half of them among children under the age of five. That is 25 times the pre-conflict rate. The WHO says  that it expects the number of deaths from disease to eventually outstrip those killed directly by military action.
***
                     Humanitarian aid                   
For two weeks at the beginning of the war, no humanitarian assistance – including food – was allowed into Gaza at all. The flow of aid has gradually increased as the war has gone on, according to figures shared by UNRWA: there were 20 trucks a day in the last 10 days of October, 85 a day in November, and 104 a day in December. But that is still way down on the pre-conflict level of 500 trucks a day.
Humanitarian aid is meanwhile far harder to distribute because of the damage caused by Israel’s bombardment – and 142 UNRWA workers have been killed , while 128 of the organisation’s buildings have been damaged. The World Food Program (WFP) says that  about one in four households are already at risk of starvation, and the entire population is facing food shortages that could lead to malnutrition.
Arif Husain, the WFP’s chief economist, told the New Yorker  that famine would follow within six months unless conditions changed. “I’ve been to all kinds of conflicts and all kinds of crises,” he said. “And, for me, this is unprecedented.” There are about 700,000 people in the world currently facing catastrophic hunger, he added; 577,000 of them are in Gaza.
                   What else we’ve been reading                                                               John Harris uses his column  to tell the enraging story of England’s special needs crisis through one father’s struggle to get help for his children. Recent coverage of councils’ financial woes has pinned the blame on “golden tickets” for too many families with education, health and care plans; the result, Harris argues, will be “more kids stuck at home and families locked into despair”.Archie                                                                                          Rebecca Nicholson  spoke to veteran actor Willem Dafoe about how the industry has changed since he started his career in 1977, the many animals on his small farm and his role in new film Poor Things.Nimo                                                                 For Saturday magazine, Julian Borger told the remarkable story  of his great-aunt Malci’s part in the Austrian resistance to the Nazis – a tale all the more remarkable for having been hidden for decades.Archie                                                                 After he had a stroke, Fanny Johnstone’s father developed vascular dementia.

Viche is a sugar cane-based alcoholic drink that has been produced by African-Colombian communities for about 300 years. It also has medicinal purposes and is used as a pick-me-up instead of coffee. Now it is being used to fight the threat of armed gangs recruiting young people  in Colombia.
On 15 January, a three-month ceasefire negotiated between armed groups by the Colombian president comes to an end. This creates a renewed risk for young people, particularly African-Colombian youth, becoming entangled with organised crime. Community leaders from Triana are hoping that viche production will create jobs and opportunities. Doña Gloria, master viche maker and leader of the Association of Black and Indigenous Peasant Women of Buenaventura, helps communities develop business strategies for commercialising the drink, enabling them to revitalise local economies. “For us, viche is a distillate of wisdom, ancestry and culture,” says Gloria.

Highlight: Conflict highlights growing gulf with west, as other big developing powers face difficult diplomatic choicesIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


China and Russia have hardened their positions towards the conflict in Gaza in recent days, as the war between Israel and Hamas aggravates existing geopolitical tensions and underscores the growing gulf between the cold war allies and western powers such as the US, UK and France.
The Chinese foreign minister said  over the weekend that Israel’s bombing campaign had gone “beyond the scope of self-defence” and that it “should stop collective punishment of the people of Gaza”.
On Friday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, raised the possibility that an intensified siege of Gaza by Israel may resemble that of Leningrad by German armies during the second world war, a reference likely to cause deep offence in Israel.
Russia’s top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in Beijing on Monday before an expected visit by Putin, which will raise western concerns about increasingly close links between the two powers.
China has historically backed the Palestinian cause for decades, as did the USSR throughout the cold war. More recently, both powers have sought to balance closer ties with Israel with their broader diplomatic efforts to win allies in the Arab world and more broadly.
Russia is seeking support for its continuing war in Ukraine while China is looking to build a broader coalition of developing countries to extend Beijing’s influence and reinforce its efforts to compete with the US on the global stage. 
“Beijing has been pro-Palestinian since Mao’s days and is mindful about the US’s close ties with Israel … [now] almost anything that the US supports, China must be against. Beijing also wishes to be seen as a key supporter to the global south, which includes most Arab countries retaining friendly ties with China. It’s a matter of maintaining those relations by continuing to support the Palestinians?,” said Dr Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at the Chatham House thinktank in London.
Analysts have suggested China is looking to offset concern in the Islamic and Arab worlds about Beijing’s treatment of the Muslim ethnic Uyghurs  in the north-western Chinese region of Xinjiang.
The Middle East supplies much of China’s oil needs and is a nexus in the belt and road  initiative, President Xi Jinping’s ambitious infrastructure project to connect markets around the world and so extend Beijing’s influence.
Since the war began, Chinese state media have been critical of Israel and blamed the US, Israel’s strongest supporter, for fanning tensions in the region. There has also been an increase in antisemitic content on the heavily policed Chinese internet, according to Yaqiu Wang, the research director for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan at the US-based not-for-profit organisation Freedom House.
Putin said on Friday that Israel had been subjected to “an attack unprecedented in its cruelty” by Hamas militants and had the right to defend itself but was responding with cruel methods of its own. “The civilian casualties [likely in the event of an Israeli ground offensive] will be absolutely unacceptable. Now the main thing is to stop the bloodshed,” he said.
Russian officials have insisted Moscow can help mediate because it has relations with Israel, the Palestinians, groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran and major Arab powers.
Russian officials have also been keen to blame the US for the conflict. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, has said the US bears “responsibility for the looming war in the Middle East”.
Other big powers in the developing world face difficult diplomatic choices.
India has made a global fight against terrorism a central principle of its foreign policy for decades and has, like Russia and China, developed economic and other ties with Israel in recent years.
But the government of Narendra Modi has also built new relationships with leading actors in the Arab world such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia that it does not want to jeopardise. As elsewhere, officials in Delhi are deeply concerned about any further escalation.
“India is slightly different from other countries in the global south in that India itself has been the victim of this kind of terrorism so this hits close to home,” said Prof Harsh Pant of the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi.
“There has been a triangulation of foreign policy for some time, with the idea that India can get along with Iran, the Arab world and Israel all at once … but if the faultlines become sharper then [Indian] diplomacy will have its work cut out.”
Reactions in Africa have been varied, with a statement from the African Union that analysts have described as “carefully balanced”.
Israel has made a significant diplomatic effort on the continent, which may be paying dividends.
Nevertheless, harsh criticism has come from South Africa, which has a specific and troubled history with Israel, which grew close to the racist, repressive apartheid regime in the 1980s.
Priyal Singh, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria, described South Africa as an outlier on the continent.
“The Israel-Palestine issue speaks to South Africa’s own divided society and history of inequality. So it is a national domestic issue too and that’s pretty unique on the continent,” he said.

Fears of regional escalation as Israel warns of ‘multi-front’ war

Highlight: Defence minister tells Knesset that country under attack from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank, Iraq, Yemen and IranIsrael-Gaza war – live updates
Body


Israel is engaged in a “multi-front war”, its defence minister has said, hinting at military operations across the Middle East as the war in Gaza showed new signs of a dangerous regional escalation.
Speaking in parliament on Tuesday, Yoav Gallant said Israel was “coming under attack from seven theatres: Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria [an Israeli term for the West Bank], Iraq, Yemen and Iran”.
“We have already responded and taken action in six of these theatres,” he told the Knesset, without specifying.
Iran-allied militias around the Middle East have attacked Israel and US military installations across the region since Hamas launched its devastating attack on southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,140 people and taking up to 250 hostage.
Israel’s retaliatory war on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has already become one of the most destructive conflicts of the 21st century , with estimates suggesting more than 20,600 people have been killed, 55,000 injured, and 85% of the Palestinian territory’s 2.3 million people forced to flee their homes.
Fighting in the 41km-by-12km territory has intensified since a seven-day ceasefire collapsed at the beginning of December. Israeli forces continued to bombard refugee camps in the centre of the strip for a fourth day on Tuesday, in an apparent sign of its promised broadening of the offensive.
A total of 241 people had been killed and 382 injured over the past 24 hours, the health ministry in Gaza said on Tuesday afternoon. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties, but about 70% of the toll is estimated to be women and children. 
Gallant’s comments on Tuesday came as the war in Gaza threatened to spill outside the borders of Israel and the Palestinian territories. Earlier in the day, Egypt said a drone was shot down near the Red Sea resort city of Dahab, the second such occurrence in a month.
The drone’s origin was not immediately clear, but Yemen’s Houthi rebels have disrupted global trade in the Red Sea with attacks on international vessels, and have launched drones and missiles towards Israel.
Late on Tuesday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack on a container ship in the Red Sea, and for an attempt to attack Israel with drones. MSC Mediterranean Shipping said there were no injuries to its crew from the attack on its ship, the United VIII, en route from Saudi Arabia to Pakistan. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a televised address the group had targeted the vessel. He also said the Houthis, which are aligned to Iran, had carried out a military operation targeting Eilat and other areas in Israel. He did not say whether any of the targets were hit.
On Saturday, the US defence department explicitly blamed Iran  for the first time since the Gaza conflict broke out for a drone attack targeting a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean.
Tuesday’s explosions occurred a day after an Israeli airstrike outside the Syrian capital of Damascus killed a senior general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards.  An Iranian statement on national television said Israel would “pay for this crime”.
In Iraq, the US bombed three sites associated with Kata’ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia it blamed for a drone strike that wounded three American soldiers based in the northern city of Erbil. The airstrikes drew sharp condemnation from the Iraqi government.
And far from the Middle East, in India, there was an explosion near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi, Israel’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Indian and Israeli officials are investigating the cause of the blast, in which no one was hurt.
Separately, Israel and the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah have traded near-daily volleys of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the frontier since 7 October. About 150 people in Lebanon have been killed, including 17 civilians, and 11 in Israel, including four civilians. Behind the scenes, the US is leading intense negotiations to try to de-escalate the hostilities on the Blue Line that separates the two countries, where the risk of miscalculation setting off a regional war is highest.
Despite increasing international outcry over the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, including growing criticism from Israel’s most important ally, the US, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said Israel would push on until achieving “complete victory” over Hamas. He reiterated during a visit to Israeli troops in Gaza on Monday that the fight “isn’t close to finished”.
“We are not stopping. The war will continue until the end, until we finish it, no less,” he said.
Israel says it does what it can to protect civilians, and blames Hamas for using Gaza’s population as human shields – a charge the group denies.
Israel’s military issued orders on Tuesday afternoon telling residents of central Gaza’s Bureij, Nuseirat and Maghazi refugee camps to leave, despite designating the camps as “evacuation zones” earlier in the war, meaning that the strip’s civilians are being forced to seek shelter in ever-smaller areas.
The UN’s human rights office said in a statement: “We are gravely concerned about the continued bombardment of Middle Gaza by Israeli forces, which has claimed more than 100 Palestinian lives since Christmas Eve.” 
Gaza and the West Bank are home to 68 refugee camps, most of which were set up to house Palestinians who fled their homes after the creation of Israel in 1948. Today, they are overcrowded and poverty-stricken, with few services.
Fighting in the northern half of the strip also appears to be fierce, despite assessments from the Israeli army’s chief of staff over the weekend that Israel had near “total operational control” over Gaza City.
Around a quarter of Gaza’s population are starving, the UN’s latest estimate said, while only nine of the territory’s 36 hospitals are functioning. Doctors, overwhelmed with injured people and lacking basic medical supplies, say that in many cases they have been forced to amputate limbs that could have been saved under different circumstances.
While since mid-December there has been an increase in aid reaching Gaza – about 200 trucks a day – aid agencies say this is still a fraction of what is needed for the population to cope with the winter, and is difficult to distribute aid because of the fighting. Before the conflict broke out, about 500 goods and aid trucks entered the territory every day.
Phone and internet lines appeared to have been blocked on Tuesday afternoon, with Gaza’s main telecoms provider, PalTel, announcing another “complete interruption of service”. Such outages are now frequent, especially before big Israeli ground operations.
Hamas cells using improvised explosive devices, ambushes and an extensive tunnel network have inflicted significant losses on the Israel Defense Forces in recent days, bringing the total number of Israeli soldiers killed to 156.
A ceasefire proposal put forward by Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, was rejected by both parties on Monday night. Talks mediated by Qatar, which led to a seven-day ceasefire at the end of November and the release of 100 hostages in exchange for 240 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails, also appear to have stalled.

                                                                                        Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has promised to “dismantle” Hamas, whom he described as “bloodthirsty monsters” at the first cabinet meeting of the new national emergency government in Tel Aviv.  Speaking before the session, which began with a moment of silence for Israeli victims of the violence, he said “We are working around the clock, as a team and a united front. The unity among us gives a clear message to the nation, the enemy and the world. I have seen our amazing soldiers who are now on the frontline. They know that the entire nation is behind them. They understand the scope of the mission. They are ready to take action at any time in order to defeat the bloodthirsty monsters who have risen against us to destroy us. Hamas thought that we would come apart – we will dismantle Hamas.”                                                                                          The Israel  Defense Forces (IDF) has said that the number of confirmed Israeli hostages being held in Gaza is 126.  Hamas has previously claimed that 13 hostages have been killed within Gaza by Israeli airstrikes. 
It said there were foreigners among those who died, without specifying their nationalities.                                                                                          The Israeli military also said that at least 279 of its soldiers have been killed since 7 October, when Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel. At least 1,300 Israelis have been killed and at least 3,400 wounded in total. A sign with a prayer for IDF forces and those killed or missing has been placed on Sunday at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where Psalms are being recited.                                                                                          The World Health Organization has condemned Israel’s order to evacuate 22 hospitals in northern Gaza that are treating more than 2,000 inpatients.  Moving that many patients to southern Gaza, “where health facilities are already running at maximum capacity and unable to absorb a dramatic rise in the number patients, could be tantamount to a death sentence”, the organisation said.                                                                                          Medics in Gaza said on Sunday that thousands could die if hospitals packed with wounded people ran out of fuel and basic supplies, as civilians under an air bombardment struggled to find food, water and safety before an expected Israeli ground offensive.  Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip have killedat least 2,329 Palestinians, with more than 9,714 wounded. In addition at least 53 people have been reported killed in the West Bank, with more than 1,100 wounded.                                                                                          Egypt is intensifying efforts with its international and regional partners to deliver aid to Gaza, according to a statement released by Egypt’s presidency on Sunday.  Egypt said its national security was a red line and that it rejects any plan to displace Palestinians. Egypt is proposing hosting a summit that would cover recent developments involving the crisis in Gaza and the future of the Palestinian issue.                                                                 The Egyptian Red Crescent, World Health Organization and other NGOs and volunteer groups remain poised to deliver aid through the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, but as yet it remains closed.                                                                                          One person was killed and three others wounded in a northern Israeli village after fire across the blue line from Lebanon into Israel. The Israeli military it was striking in Lebanon in retaliation, and it declared a zone within 4 km (2.5 miles) of the blue line off-limits to public access. It said it is deliberately disrupting GPS operations in northern Israel near Lebanon, and also in the south near Gaza.                                                                                          Israel’s communications minister has said he is seeking a possible closure of Al Jazeera’s local bureau and accused the Qatari news station of pro-Hamas incitement and of exposing Israeli soldiers to potential attack from Gaza.  Shloma Karhi said the proposal to shut Al Jazeera had been vetted by Israeli security officials and was being examined by legal experts. He would bring it to the cabinet later in the day, he said. Al Jazeera and the government in Doha had no immediate comment.                                                                                          Pope Francis on Sunday called for humanitarian corridors to help those under siege in Gaza and renewed his appeal for the release of hostages held by militant Islamist group Hamas.   “I strongly ask that the children, the sick, the elderly, women and all civilians do not become victims of the conflict,” the pope said during his weekly address to the crowds in St Peter’s square. “Humanitarian right must be respected, above all in Gaza.”                                                                                          The US is sending a second aircraft carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean, the US defence secretary has confirmed, saying it is “to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas’s attack”.                                                                 The US embassy in Israel has published details of how it will attempt to evacuate people by sea from Haifa to Cyprus tomorrow.                                                                                          US secretary of state Antony Blinken said his meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, in Riyadh was “very productive”.                                                                                          The EU is to convene an emergency meeting of its member states to discuss the consequences of the deteriorating situation in Israel  and Palestine.  Sending out an invitation for a summit on Tuesday, the European Council president, Charles Michel, said if the EU was “not careful” the conflict could “feed extremism” across Europe. He said he is also concerned about the consequences for neighbouring countries’ capacity to deal with refugees and the potential for onward crisis support in the EU.                                                                                          Israel ’s actions in Gaza have gone “beyond the scope of self-defence” and the Israeli government must “cease its collective punishment of the people of Gaza”, China ’s foreign minister said in remarks published on Sunday.                                                                 The Jerusalem Post reported earlier that Iran had sent a private message to Israel through the UN that it could intervene if Israel continues its military campaign in Gaza.                                                                                          Britain’s foreign secretary has said Israel should show “restraint” as it prepares to invade Gaza , marking a slight change of tone from the UK government.  James Cleverly on Sunday urged the Israel  Defence Forces to show “discipline” and avoid mass casualties. He told the BBC the UK government had been lobbying Egypt to open the Rafah border crossing.                                                                                          Cleverly said that considering about 10 British people dead or missing was not an “unreasonable estimate”, and declined to say if the UK believed actions by Israel so far had been a breach of international law.  The UN’s OHCHR position has been that the evacuation order imposed by the Israeli military on the civilian population of the Gaza Strip is  “a crime against humanity, and collective punishment is prohibited under international humanitarian law”.                                                                                          The Scottish National party has supported the UN’s calls for an immediate ceasefire on the Gaza Strip. The motion, passed by acclaim on Sunday morning at its conference in Aberdeen, follows repeated pleas from Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s first minister and SNP leader, for restraint in the conflict. Yousaf’s mother-in-law and father-in-law, who is Palestinian, are stranded in Gaza and living without enough food, water and power.

Body


Fierce fighting across the besieged Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours has killed 166 Palestinians and 13 Israeli soldiers, in one of the single deadliest days of the new conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas to date.
Heavy bombing and shelling of Jabaliya, in the north of the Palestinian territory, overnight continued into Sunday morning, residents of the area said, while in Gaza City, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have begun a ground operation in the central neighbourhood of Tufah. In the southern half of the strip, aerial and ground attacks continue in the territory’s second city, Khan Younis.
At least 166 people had been killed since Saturday, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said, bringing the total number of dead to 20,424, although thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble. The ministry does not distinguish between civilian and militant deaths, but about 70% of those killed are believed to be women and children.
This figure did not include the toll of at least 70 killed late on Sunday night following an Israeli airstrike that hit central Gaza’s Maghazi refugee camp. Palestinian authorities said the number of casualties was likely to climb.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society reported an attack on one of its main bases in Khan Younis and said a 13-year-old child had been shot dead by an Israeli drone while inside the city’s al-Amal hospital. Another six people were killed in a strike on a house in the central Bureij refugee camp and two in a strike in Rafah, the strip’s southernmost town, on the border with Egypt, the agency said.
On Sunday morning the IDF announced the names of eight soldiers who were killed on top of another five announced killed in action on Saturday night, bringing the total to 154 combat losses since Israel declared war in response to Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel in which militants killed 1,140 people and seized another 240 as hostages.
On Sunday, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said: “The war is exacting a very heavy cost from us; however we have no choice [but] to continue to fight.” At least some of the weekend’s Israeli casualties were killed in friendly fire incidents, two Israeli newspapers reported.
Also on Sunday, an Israeli military spokesperson said its forces had killed 8,000 Palestinian fighters, saying that the figure was drawn from accounts of targeted strikes, battlefield tallies and interrogations of captives. Hamas has never said how many of its members have been killed.
The mounting death tolls come despite Israeli claims that after 12 weeks of conflict it has achieved almost complete operational control over northern Gaza, and growing worries for desperate civilians in the south as Israel expands its operations into that half of the territory. Almost all of the strip’s 2.3 million residents have already sought shelter south of the Gaza River after being told by the Israeli army it would be safer.
Joudat Imad, 55, a father of six, had to leave an area of the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Sunday. He had taken his family there from Gaza City after a map published by the IDF marked it as an evacuation zone.
“I was lucky to get a tent in Rafah,” he told Reuters by phone. “From an owner of two buildings to a refugee in a tent awaiting aid – that is what this brutal war has turned us to. The world is sick and inhumane that it can’t see Israel’s brutality and it is helpless to stop this war of destruction and starvation. ”
Conditions across Gaza are dire. The World Food Programme’s (WFP) most recent food security update said the situation is worst in the north, where 90% of people have gone a full day and night without eating. Clean water, electricity and access to medical treatment are also hard to find, with aid agencies warning that an increase in aid since 17 December  is a fraction of what is needed for the population to survive the winter. Aid that gets in, the WFP said, is difficult to distribute because of the fighting and lack of fuel and usable roads.
After days of objections from the US, Israel’s most important ally, the UN security council managed to pass a resolution on Friday  which urges steps to allow “safe, unhindered, and expanded humanitarian access” to Gaza and “conditions for a sustainable cessation” of fighting. Washington eventually abstained from the vote, contending it would let Iran-backed Hamas regroup and rearm.
Efforts mediated by Qatar aimed at brokering a second ceasefire and round of hostage exchanges, after a first at the end of November saw about 100 Israelis released in return for 240 Palestinian women and children in Israeli jails, appear to have faltered, with Israeli officials turning to the Egyptian channel in search of progress. A number of Hamas leaders who live outside Gaza travelled last week to Cairo, a positive sign that indirect talks were held.
Joe Biden discussed the Israeli campaign in Gaza in a 45-minute phone call with Netanyahu on Saturday night, a statement from the White House said.
The US president “emphasised the critical need to protect the civilian population including those supporting the humanitarian aid operation, and the importance of allowing civilians to move safely away from areas of ongoing fighting”, as well as “the importance of securing the release of all remaining hostages,” his office said.
Despite growing international outcry over the humanitarian disaster in Gaza, including growing criticism in Washington, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that Israel will push on until “complete victory” over Hamas is achieved. US officials have urged their Israeli counterparts to shift away from large-scale aerial and ground operations in the Gaza Strip to a new phrase in the war focused on the precise targeting of Hamas leaders, but have also stressed that they will not “dictate timelines or terms”.
The IDF’s main focus now appears to be finding and destroying Hamas’s extensive network of tunnels  in the Gaza Strip, which high-ranking officers have admitted has proved to be far more difficult than anticipated. Generals have estimated that the army will need at least several more weeks to fulfil that goal.
Meanwhile, the situation on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, where it has been engaged in cross-border attacks with the powerful Iran-backed militia Hezbollah since 7 October, remains volatile; behind the scenes, the US is leading intense negotiations to try to de-escalate tensions that could spark a regional war.
In the Red Sea, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, also aligned with Iran, have disrupted global trade with missile and drone attacks on international vessels, ostensibly in solidarity with the Palestinian people. A drone the US defence department said it believed was launched from Iran also struck a chemical tanker in the Indian Ocean on Saturday.
In comments made at his weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Netanyahu denied reports that Biden had persuaded him not to launch a pre-emptive attack on Hezbollah during the first days of the war.
“Israel is a sovereign state,” Netanyahu said. “Our decisions in the war are based on our operational considerations, and I will not elaborate on that.”

Body


The US should place “no limit” to civilian casualties Israel might inflict in Gaza in response to the Hamas terror attacks of 7 October, a senior Republican senator said.
Speaking to CNN, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina was asked  : “Is there a threshold for you, and do you think there should be one for the United States government, in which the US would say, ‘Let’s hold off for a second in terms of civilian casualties?’”
Graham said  : “No. If somebody asked us after world war two, ‘Is there a limit what would you do to make sure that Japan and Germany don’t conquer the world? Is there any limit what Israel should do to the people who are trying to slaughter the Jews?’
“The answer is no. There is no limit.”
Graham said Israel should “be smart” and “try to limit civilian casualties the best we can. Let’s put humanitarian aid in areas that protect the innocent. I’m all for that.”
At least  1,400 people were killed on 7 October, when Hamas fighters attacked Israeli targets. More than 200 hostages were taken. The Gaza health ministry says nearly  9,000 people have since been killed in Israeli strikes.
Graham appeared on CNN on Tuesday night, in the aftermath of airstrikes on a Gaza refugee camp which killed dozens.  The Israeli military said it targeted a Hamas commander. Hamas said  hostages, including foreign passport holders, were killed.
The CNN host, Abby Phillip, asked Graham: “In 2023 … is it acceptable to drop bombs on a densely populated civilian area where there are refugees, where people are living, where there are children?”
Recounting atrocities reportedly carried out by Hamas, Graham said its destruction was “non-negotiable”. He also said he “hate[d] the loss of innocent lives”, and claimed Israel was trying to limit civilian casualties as Hamas tried to increase them.
“The day after Hamas is destroyed,” Graham said, “I hope we have a better life for the Palestinian people. But I’m not blaming Israel. I’m blaming Hamas. I’m not blaming Israel at all.”
Graham has long been one of the most extreme voices on the Israel-Hamas conflict in American politics. He told Fox News  previously that “Gaza is going to look like Tokyo and Berlin at the end of world war two when this is over. And if it doesn’t look that way, Israel made a mistake.”
He also called for the US to attack Iran  if that country’s allied militia in Lebanon – Hezbollah – were to attack Israel.

Highlight: Hundreds are dead after a surprise attack by Hamas, prompting Israel to declare a state of war and launch retaliatory strikesLive: Hamas Gaza hideouts will be turned to ‘rubble’, Netanyahu says
Body


Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories are reeling after the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas launched the biggest attack on the Jewish state in 50 years. Hundreds are dead after a surprise attack on the morning of a Jewish holiday and Israel has declared a state of war.
Here is what we know so far:
                                                               Israeli forces continued to battle Hamas fighters on the streets of southern Israel on Sunday and launched strikes that levelled buildings in Gaza, more than 24 hours after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise and unprecedented incursion into Israel – the deadliest in decades.                                                                 At least 600 Israelis were killed, including 44 soldiers, and more than 2,000 wounded, Israeli media reported.                                                                 At least 370 Palestinians were killed, including 20 children, and 2,200 wounded as a result of airstrikes in Gaza since Saturday, the Palestinian authority said. Seven people were also killed by Israeli army fire in the West Bank.                                                                 Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was at war and would exact a heavy price from its enemies. Hamas leaders said they were prepared for further escalation.                                                                 Israel military officials said “hundreds of terrorists” had been killed and dozens captured as the fighting continued on Sunday.                                                                 Israeli military said a “substantial” number of civilians and soldiers had been taken to Gaza and were being held hostage.                                                                 In northern Israel, a brief exchange of strikes between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group raised fears of a broader conflict.                                                                 In neighbouring Egypt, a policeman shot dead two Israeli tourists and an Egyptian at a tourist site in Alexandria.                                                                 The UN security council is due to meet on Sunday after the secretary general, António Guterres, urged “all diplomatic efforts to avoid a wider conflagration”.                                                                 Israel will stop supplying electricity, fuel and goods to Gaza, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office on Saturday night.                                                                 The US president, Joe Biden, issued a staunch condemnation of the attacks by Hamas against Israel, saying in an address on Saturday: “ The United States stands with Israel”. He issued a statement earlier calling the attacks “horrific” and an “appalling assault”.

Highlight: On day of high tension, Israel also releases Palestinian prisoners and humanitarian convoy enters GazaIsrael-Hamas war: latest updates
Body


The first group of hostages walked free from Gaza on Friday on a day of high tension and profound relief – but also acute concern for the future after weeks of relentless violence in the war between Israel and Hamas.
Twenty-four hostages were released by Hamas – 13 Israelis, 10 Thais and a Philippine national – as part of a deal that has brought about a temporary pause in hostilities and includes the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
There was celebration in Israel and a day of relative calm in Gaza, where thousands have been killed and more than 1 million people displaced. But though the deal has raised hopes of a more durable ceasefire, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed he would not end Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas. 
The 13 Israelis had reached their home country by early evening. Several were recognised by friends and neighbours from their kibbutz communities. They included very young children whose seven-week ordeal in captivity is finally over after they were abducted during bloody attacks launched by Hamas last month.
A total of 39 Palestinian prisoners – 24 women, including some convicted of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers jailed for offences such as throwing stones – were also released by Israel on Friday evening. Some had not seen their homes for many years.
The four-day ceasefire marks the first break in seven weeks of war in Gaza and offers some relief for the 2.3 million Palestinians who have endured intensive Israeli bombardment, as well as for families in Israel fearful for the fate of their loved ones taken captive during the attack that triggered the conflict.
Under the agreement, Hamas is due to free at least 50 of the approximately 240 mostly Israeli hostages  it has held since launching attacks into southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed. In return, Israel will release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and allow up to 300 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Netanyahu hailed the return of the Israeli hostages, among them an 85-year-old woman and a two-year-old girl.
“Each of them is an entire world. But I emphasise … we are committed to returning all the hostages. This is one of the aims of the war and we are committed to achieving all the aims of the war,” Netanyahu said.
Israel said it had received a list of hostages set to be freed by Hamas on Saturday following Friday’s release. Israeli security officials were reviewing the list, Netanyahu’s office said. 
The ceasefire, initially lasting four or five days, was announced early on Wednesday  and has raised hopes for a more durable pause in the violence.
The Israeli offensive on Gaza has killed more than 14,000 people, thousands of them children, according to Palestinian officials. More are thought to be buried under rubble.
Underlining the fragility of the four-day pause, an alert sounded in Israel 15 minutes after the ceasefire began at 7am, warning of a possible incoming rocket from Gaza targeting a village in southern Israel, followed by reports of the sound of artillery firing from Israel.
But through the morning and into the afternoon a relative calm seemed to have been established across much of Gaza.
In a surprise development, the Thai prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, said a number of Thai hostages had been released.  They are thought to be farm workers who had been employed in communities around Gaza where Gelienor Pacheco, from the Philippines, was a carer.
The Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, said he was “overjoyed”  to confirm the release.
“He is now safely in the custody of officials in our Israel Embassy,” Marcos said on X (formerly Twitter). “I salute the work of the Philippine foreign service in securing his release, and once again thank the state of Qatar for their invaluable assistance in making Jimmy’s release possible.”
Marcos said the search for a second missing person was continuing.
Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs said 10 Thai hostages  had been released and their families had been notified.
“This group will stay in the hospital for at least 48 hours, while RTE [the royal Thai embassy] will make all the necessary arrangements for their travel back to Thailand and their families as soon as possible,” the ministry said in a statement.
The hostages were transferred out of Gaza and handed over to Egyptian authorities at the Rafah border crossing, accompanied by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
“The deep pain that family members separated from their loved ones feel is indescribable,” said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC’s regional director for the Near and Middle East. “We are relieved that some will be reunited after long agony.”
The Israeli military said the hostages had undergone an initial medical assessment inside Israeli territory.
The released hostages were then flown to medical facilities around Israel, where they would be reunited with loved ones. There was celebration among hostages’ families and supporters gathered in Tel Aviv.
“We couldn’t wait for the hours to pass,” said Corinne Moshe, the daughter-in-law of released hostage Adina Moshe, 72.
Her husband and his siblings were waiting at a hospital to reunite with their mother, she told Israel’s Kan public broadcaster.
Corinne’s son Erez said he was waiting to see his grandmother.
“I miss her very, very much. I want her to be back already. I want to have dinner with her and the entire family again.”
The Schneider Children’s Medical Centre said it was treating eight Israelis – four children and four women – and that all appeared to be in good physical condition, according to Associated Press. The centre said they were also receiving psychological treatment, adding that “these are sensitive moments” for the families.
The vocal campaign led by the families has been a significant factor in pushing Netanyahu to accept a deal with Hamas, an organisation he has sworn to “crush”.
“We hope the picture will be beautiful at the end of the day,” Ziv Agmon, a legal adviser to Netanyahu’s office, told reporters, adding that Israel would “follow the agreement”.
Ismail Haniyeh, the main political leader of Hamas outside Gaza, said in a recording on Friday that the Islamist group was committed to the agreement, struck after lengthy and complex talks  mediated by Qatar, the US and Egypt, as long as Israel was committed as well.
In the occupied West Bank, families waited anxiously throughout the day for news of the prisoners due to be freed.
Two white coaches, escorted by armoured vehicles, were seen leaving the Ofer military camp in the West Bank during the early evening.
The Palestinian prisoners inside the buses were greeted by large crowds on reaching the Beitunia checkpoint, many of whom chanted “God is great”, and bursts of fire crackers lit up the night sky.
They included Malak Salman, who was arrested seven years ago for trying to stab a police officer in Jerusalem. Now 23, she was returned to her home in Beit Safafa, in annexed East Jerusalem, under Israeli police escort.
“The police are in our house and are stopping people coming to see us,” her mother, Fatina, said. “My daughter is weak, she has not eaten since yesterday.” 
The exchange of female and child hostages and prisoners was initially scheduled for Thursday afternoon but was postponed as last-minute logistical issues were worked out during 24 hours of frantic diplomacy.
The agreement includes a halt to Israeli military flights over southern Gaza, with air activity over northern Gaza restricted to six hours a day. Israel has agreed not to arrest anyone in Gaza for the duration of the truce, according to a Hamas statement.
Reports suggest that if the first exchanges go well, and Hamas can locate more female hostages or children, there will be further releases on both sides. Some sources have suggested the ceasefire could last up to 10 days as a result.
Aid trucks began entering the Gaza Strip from Egypt about 90 minutes after the ceasefire began at 5am local time. 
Humanitarian officials said the aid was a fraction of what was needed, and that there were robust procedures to prevent Hamas commandeering fuel and other basics, a concern voiced repeatedly by Israeli officials. An almost total blockade of Gaza by Israel had led to acute shortages of all essentials and “catastrophic” conditions , aid agencies said.
Medical facilities have been wrecked across the territory, and doctors have described trying to treat “overwhelming” numbers of seriously injured casualties with inadequate supplies.
Swaths of northern Gaza have been destroyed and up to 1 million people displaced. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters, without presenting evidence for its count.
The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) told residents of Gaza the war was not over. “The humanitarian pause is temporary,” it said on social media. “The northern Gaza Strip is a dangerous war zone and it is forbidden to move north. For your safety, you must remain in the humanitarian zone in the south.”
A similar message was repeated in leaflets dropped over southern Gaza, where almost all Gaza residents are living after being told to leave the north, where fighting between the IDF and Hamas has been the most intense.
Despite the warnings, many joyful but wary Palestinians emerged from makeshift shelters in southern Gaza at the start of the ceasefire to attempt the long journey back to their homes in the north of the territory. Many found their way barred by Israeli troops.
The Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, has described the ceasefire as “a short respite, at the end of which the fighting will continue intensely”.
“We will create pressure to bring back more hostages. At least another two months of fighting is expected,” he said.
Israel’s northern border with Lebanon was quiet on Friday, a day after Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, carried out the highest number of attacks in one day since fighting there began on 8 October.
The militant Islamist movement and militia is not a party to the ceasefire agreement, but was widely expected to halt its attacks.

Good morning.
With much of Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital in ruins, Israeli forces say they have withdrawn from the area  after a two-week operation.
Israel has described the raid as one of the most successful operations of the nearly six-month war, with the Israeli military saying it had killed about 200 militants in fighting in and around al-Shifa, and that it seized weapons and valuable intelligence.
The scene left behind was one of devastation: windows blown out, concrete walls blackened; and volunteers carrying away shrouded corpses across the sandy wasteland, Agence France-Presse reported.
The World Health Organization said 21 patients had died in the past two weeks and that more than 100 others requiring care needed to be urgently moved to safety amid unsanitary conditions.
“Among the patients are four children and 28 critical patients lacking necessary means of care – no diapers, urine bags, water to clean wounds. Many have infected wounds and are dehydrated,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, wrote on X on Sunday.
“Since yesterday only one bottle of water remains for every 15 people. Contagious diseases are spreading due to extremely unsanitary conditions, and a lack of water.”
                                                                                        Six months later, how are Israelis feeling about the Israel-Hamas war? Tens of thousands of people across Israel joined the families of hostages at the weekend to protest and call for the removal of Benjamin Netanyahu , labelling the Israeli prime minister as an obstacle in a deal to bring home those held captive.                                                                                          What is the future of the Gaza Strip? Experts and people in the territory fear that Gaza is facing deepening anarchy  as the last remnants of civil order break down, leaving a vacuum increasingly filled by armed gangs, clans, powerful families and criminals.                                                                                Seven children wounded in Indianapolis mass shooting                                      
Seven children between the ages of 12 and 17 were wounded outside a shopping mall in Indianapolis, in the latest mass shooting in the US. Police believe more than one gun was used in the shooting, but no arrests have been made. Police did not immediately have any suspects.
“Once again, we have a situation in which young people are resolving conflict with firearms, and it has to stop,” said Tanya Terry, the deputy chief of the Indianapolis metropolitan police department. “Conflict should not lead to somebody pulling out a gun and trying to resolve it. The consequences are eternal.”

Crews of engineers have begun the dangerous and intricate job of removing the mangled wreckage of the Francis Scott Key Bridge  from the Patapsco River outside Baltimore.                                                                                          A total solar eclipse will sweep across the Pacific Ocean, Mexico, the US and Canada on 8 April.                                                                                           A Chinese scientist who was imprisoned for his role in creating the world’s first genetically edited babies says he has returned to his laboratory  to work on the treatment of Alzheimer’s and other genetic diseases.                                                                                          A Republican congressman has said the US should ensure Gaza is subjected to nuclear bombing in the way                         “Nagasaki and Hiroshima” were at the end of the second world war, comments that have drawn condemnation  from progressive political quarters and civil rights groups.                                                                                Stat of the day: 8% of Americans strongly believe in baseless                     ‘chemtrails                     ’ conspiracy theory                                      
The Tennessee state senate passed a bill  this month endorsing the baseless concept of chemtrails – the belief that the cloudy white lines left behind by planes high in the sky are chemicals being released into the atmosphere at the behest of the government, or shadowy private organizations, for anything from modifying the weather to controlling a population’s minds. There is also a movement to pass a similar law in Pennsylvania.
“There’s no such thing as chemtrails,” said Alan Robock, a climate science professor at Rutgers University. “There’s no evidence that anybody is pumping chemicals into airplanes. If this was a huge [government] conspiracy to do those things, do you think nobody would sort of, tell on them?” he said.

In March 2016, Honduran Indigenous and environmental leader Berta Cáceres was murdered  for her opposition to an internationally financed dam – three employees of the energy company behind the construction project have since been convicted in her killing. But more than 11 years later, Honduras remains the most dangerous country for nature defenders in the world, with 70 environmental activists killed since Cáceres’ murder. An estimated 90% of violent incidents towards human rights defender in Honduras go unpunished.

With Jakarta rapidly sinking, construction has begun on Nusantara , Indonesia’s planned new capital in the province of East Kalimantan. But critics say the development is too ambitious and rushed, and warn it could come with high costs, not only to the state, but also to the surrounding environment and local Indigenous communities.
“Nusantara is changing the shape of everything,” said Pandi, a member of the Indigenous Balik community.

While the focus of storage for the energy industry has been mainly on giant conventional batteries, there’s growing interest in storing energy in the form of heat.  A number of startups are now looking to form batteries out of air, salt and bricks because those materials are good at holding in warmth.

Japan’s royal family is now on Instagram , marking a shift in the agency’s careful management of the family’s senior members. The initial images released follow a steady course favored by other royal families around the world – a dignified attendance at a medical awards ceremony, a bonsai exhibition and a meeting with the president and first lady of Kenya.

                                                                                        The Rafah border                          crossing between Gaza  and Egypt has opened for the first time in more than three weeks of brutal conflict to allow the evacuation of dozens of Palestinian injured requiring hospital treatment and hundreds of foreign passport holders.  Live pictures from television crews at the border on the Gaza’s side showed scores of people and cars moving through the gates towards the Egyptian side through the damaged terminal area, some carrying their belongings. By late Wednesday, at least 335 dual nationals and 76 injured seriously wounded and sick people had crossed the border, with more expected to follow. 
                                                                                          The opening of the crossing was negotiated between Egypt, Israel and Hamas, in coordination with the US, after the intervention of Qatar, which mediated in the talks.  There is no indication of how long the Rafah crossing would remain open. The border authority in Gaza added that Egypt had agreed to let in 81 of the most badly wounded on Wednesday, seeking evacuation. A security source told Reuters up to 500 people may be able to leave.                                                                                           The families of British citizens trapped in Gaza have said it is devastating that their loved ones have been turned away from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, as the Foreign Office said the first UK nationals had made it through. It is understood that initially only two of the 500 people on a list of those eligible to leave were British nationals.                                                                                            Israeli forces continued to bomb the Palestinian enclave from land, sea and air                         as they pressed their offensive against Hamas militants. Another blast shook Jabalia, Gaza’s largest refugee camp, on Wednesday, a day after Palestinian health officials said an Israeli airstrike killed about 50 people and wounded 150 there. Israel said it killed a Hamas commander in the attack. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it has killed Muhammad A’sar, the commander of Hamas’s anti-tank guided missile array, in an airstrike in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday.                                                                                           Hamas’s armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, claimed on Wednesday that seven civilian hostages were killed in Israeli strikes on Jabalia refugee camp, including three foreign passport holders.  Hamas seized more than 240 hostages during its murderous rampage inside Israel on 7 October, including children, women and elderly people. Since then it has released four civilians, the Israeli army claims to have rescued one IDF soldier who was a hostage, and Shani Louk, who was thought to be a hostage, has been declared killed.                                                                                           Saudi Arabia on Wednesday roundly condemned the deadly Israeli bombing of Gaza’s largest refugee camp that killed dozens of people.  Israel claimed it had targeted a Hamas  tunnel complex under the densely populated Jabalia camp, killing local battalion commander Ibrahim Biari, who it believes was involved in the militant group’s 7 October attacks. AFP witnessed at least 47 bodies being recovered from the scene.                                                                                           The UN human rights office said Israel’s airstrike on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday could amount to war crimes. The agency said it had “serious concerns” given the “high number of civilian casualties and the scale of destruction” following the strikes. The UN’s humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said the airstrikes were  “ just the latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza” and said the world “seems unable, or unwilling, to act.”                                                                                           Benjamin Netanyahu has mourned the loss of Israeli soldiers inside Gaza, saying “We are in a difficult war”. In a statement he said “This will be a long war. We have so many important achievements but also painful losses. Our soldiers have fallen in the most just of wars, the war for our home”.                                                                                            The only cancer treatment hospital in the Gaza Strip has gone out of service after it ran out of fuel,  health officials said  on Wednesday. The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital told a press conference “We tell the world – don’t leave cancer patients to a certain death due to the hospital being out of service.”                                                                                          Internet and phone networks were down across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, the Palestinian telecommunications agency said. It is the second such blackout in Gaza in less than a week.                                                                                           The UN child rights committee has warned that “grave” human rights violations against children are “mounting by the minute” in the Gaza Strip, and called for an immediate ceasefire. “There are no winners in a war where thousands of children are killed,” the UN committee on the rights of the child said in a statement on Wednesday.                                                                                           At least 8,525 Palestinians, including 3,542 children, have been killed in bombardments in Gaza, according to Hamas health ministry figures  issued before the strikes on Jabalia. Gaza has become “a graveyard for thousands of children,” a Unicef spokesperson said.                                                                                           Pope Francis said on Wednesday that a two-state solution was needed for Israel and Palestine. The head of the Catholic church noted that Jerusalem should be given special status.                                                                                           Palestine solidarity protesters have gathered outside Downing Street                         as Kamala Harris arrived for a meeting with Rishi Sunak. The White House said on Monday that Harris would be visiting the UK and meeting Sunak to discuss matters including the Israel-Hamas conflict and “next steps in our support for Ukraine”.                                                                                           The BBC has announced  it is launching an emergency radio service for Gaza in response to the conflict in the region.

Body


Israel has re-established control of all the communities that were overrun by Hamas fighters over the weekend, but militants may still be present on its territory, a defence forces spokesperson has said.
The chief military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, said the country had drafted a record 300,000 reservists in response to Saturday’s surprise, multi-front Hamas attack from Gaza and was “going on the offensive”.
“We are now carrying out searches in all of the communities and clearing the area,” he said in a televised briefing on Monday. Military officials had previously said their focus was on securing Israel’s side of the border before carrying out any major escalation of the counteroffensive in Gaza.
Hagari confirmed reports that 700 people had been killed in Israel – a staggering toll by the scale of recent conflicts – including at least 73 members of the security forces. The Palestinian health ministry said retaliatory Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip killed more than 100 people overnight on Sunday, bringing the Palestinian death toll since Saturday to 493, with more than 2,750 wounded.
Late on Sunday, the Israeli rescue service Zaka said it had recovered at least 260 bodies from the site of the Supernova music festival, near the Re’im kibbutz close to the Gaza border, which was overrun by Hamas fighters  on Saturday. Shocking images and video from the site showed festivalgoers running across open fields as Hamas gunmen targeted them.
Some of the revellers were among the more than 100 hostages  taken into Gaza since the incursion, which caught Israel’s vaunted military and intelligence apparatus off guard and brought heavy battles to its streets for the first time in decades.
There were reports on Monday morning of an active hostage situation in a kibbutz in southern Israel, and ongoing rocket and artillery fire in the southern city of Ashkelon. Israeli forces reported fighting between an Israeli paratroop brigade and militants in the southern city of Sderot.
Breaches remain in the triple-layered and electrified barrier that surrounds Gaza’s eastern border. Hamas militants are believed to have used a tunnel that emerges close to the kibbutz of Be’eri, 4 miles from the border. An Israeli military spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, said 70 Hamas militants fought there overnight.
Hecht called the events of the last three days “a change of paradigm”. There were reports that an airstrike on a building in Rafah, which killed 25 people, was launched without a warning shot being fired, suggesting the Israel Defence Forces may have abandoned this practice.
The IDF spokesperson provided no comment on whether it had halted the practice, or the reported use of white phosphorus in Gaza, a densely populated area and home to more than 2 million people.
Early on Monday, Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, an IDF spokesperson, said the situation in Israel was dire. “It is by far the worst day in Israeli history. Never before have so many Israelis been killed by one single thing on one day.”
Drawing a US analogy, he said the weekend’s attack, for Israel, “could be a 9/11 and a Pearl Harbor wrapped into one”.
Conricus said a significant number of Israeli civilians and military personnel had been taken hostage and moved into Gaza. He did not specify a figure, but said “many, many Israelis [have been] forcefully taken from Israel”.
He said the IDF military response had two primary objectives. “At the end of this war, Hamas will no longer have any military capabilities to threaten Israeli civilians … [and] Hamas will not be able to govern the Gaza Strip.”
Survivors of the festival attack described the rockets and gunfire  coming from several directions as the assault unfolded on Saturday morning.
Arik Nani went to the party to celebrate his 26th birthday on Friday night but ended up fleeing a massacre the following morning. “I heard shots from every direction, they were firing at us from both sides,” he told Reuters. “Everyone was running and didn’t know what to do. It was total chaos.”
After hours of running, Nani and his friend reached shelter where he heard horrifying stories from others who had escaped. “People speaking about murder they saw in front of their eyes, someone who saw an entire kidnapped family and a small girl who was murdered,” he said.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared war on Hamas on Sunday , raising the prospect of a ground assault on Gaza, a move that in the past has brought further casualties.
Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militia claimed to have abducted more than 130 people from Israel, saying they would be traded for the release of thousands of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The announcement, though unconfirmed, was the first sign of the scope of the abductions.
The captives are known to include soldiers and civilians, including women, children and older adults – mostly Israelis but also people of other nationalities. Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, told the US news channel CBS that “dozens” of American citizens, largely dual nationals, were among the hostages.
The Israeli military said only that the number of captives was “significant”.
An Egyptian official told the Associated Press that Israel sought help from Cairo to ensure the safety of the hostages, amid frantic negotiations by Egyptian officials in a vain attempt to broker a ceasefire.
Egypt had discussed a potential ceasefire with both Palestinian militants and Israeli officials, it said, but Israel was not open to a truce “at this stage”, according to the official, who asked not to be identified.
Israeli forces have continued their attacks by land and sea on the Gaza Strip, including strikes that levelled much of the town of Beit Hanoun in the north-east of the enclave. 
Hagari told journalists Hamas used the town as a staging ground for attacks. “We will continue to attack in this way, with this force, continuously, on all gathering [places] and routes used by Hamas,” he said.
Across Gaza, a densely populated strip of land housing 2.3 million people, residents described their terror at having nowhere to seek shelter  from the increasing bombardments. The area has been sealed off by an Israeli blockade since the 2006 election of Hamas, as well as by routine closures on the southern border with Egypt.
Nasser Abu Quta told the AP news agency that 19 members of his family and five of his neighbours were killed in an airstrike on their building in a refugee camp in Rafah, southern Gaza.
The building housed only civilians, he insisted. “This is a safe house, with children and women,” the 57-year-old said by telephone.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the strike. Another strike in the same city early on Monday killed 11, including women and children.
In a UN security council emergency meeting on Sunday, the US demanded all 15 members strongly condemn “these heinous terrorist attacks committed by Hamas”, but they took no immediate action.
The US deputy ambassador, Robert Wood, said afterwards that “a good number of countries” did condemn the Hamas attack.
Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, told AP that the US tried to say during the meeting that Russia was not condemning the attacks, but “that’s untrue”.
“It was in my comments,” he said. “We condemn all the attacks on civilians.”
The US special antisemitism envoy, Deborah Lipstadt, who is one of the world’s most renowned Holocaust scholars, called the Hamas attacks “the most lethal assault against Jews since the Holocaust”.
She said there was “no justification” for the “heinous, barbaric terrorism against Israeli civilians” and mass murder.

Highlight: Comments by David Barnea follow assassination of Hamas deputy political chief Saleh al-Arouri in LebanonIsrael-Gaza war – live updates
Body


The head of Israel’s foreign intelligence service has vowed to track down and kill all Hamas leaders responsible for attacking Israel, less than a day after a drone strike in Lebanon killed the militant organisation’s second most senior official. 
David Barnea said on Wednesday the Mossad was “committed to settling the score with the murderers who descended upon the Gaza envelope” on 7 October and with those who planned the attacks.
Barnea spoke at the funeral of the former Mossad director Zvi Zamir, who oversaw Israel’s bloody retaliation against Palestinian militant groups after the 1972 killings of Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich. 
“It will take time, just like after the Munich massacre, but we will lay our hands on them wherever they will be … Every Arab mother ought know that if her son participated, directly or indirectly, in the slaughter of 7 October, his blood shall be upon his own head,” Barnea told mourners.
Israel has not formally accepted responsibility for the strike in a southern Beirut suburb that killed Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy political chief of Hamas.
In recent months, Israeli officials have pledged a repeat of the campaign launched after Munich , which led to more than a dozen assassinations in European countries, north Africa and Lebanon. Both Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet, the internal security service, have promised the public and parliamentarians to hunt down Hamas leaders overseas.
Israel has waged a nearly three-month war against Hamas in Gaza after the Palestinian militant group launched the 7 October attack on southern Israel that resulted in the deaths of at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians.
The offensive launched by Israel in Gaza after the attack has since killed at least 22,313 Palestinians there, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Hamas officials expressed defiance after the assassination of Arouri, 58. “We say to the criminal occupation [Israel] that the battle between us is open,” said Husam Badran, a member of Hamas’s politburo.
Ismail Haniyeh , the leader of Hamas, said the organisation was “more powerful and determined” after the strike, which killed six other Hamas officials. The assassination has increased fears of a major outbreak of violence on Israel’s northern border.
Hezbollah, a heavily-armed Islamist militant movement based in Lebanon that is loosely allied with Hamas, has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israel across the border since the war in Gaza began. More than 100 Hezbollah fighters and two dozen civilians have been killed on Lebanese territory in the violence, as well as at least nine Israeli soldiers in Israel.
In a much anticipated televised speech on Wednesday, Hasran Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, called the assassination of Arouri a “heinous crime” that “will not go unanswered or unpunished” but stopped short of announcing an immediate escalation of hostilities. 
Nasrallah claimed Hezbollah had already deterred an Israeli invasion of Lebanon and was not afraid of war. “We are not intimidated …. If you are considering war with us you will regret it,” Nasrallah said, adding that he would give further details of Hezbollah’s response to the assassination of Arouri in a second speech on Friday. 
Kandice Ardiel, a spokesperson for the UN interim force in Lebanon (Unifil), which was deployed to the south of Lebanon in 1978 in an effort to prevent conflict between militants there and Israel, said UN officials were deeply concerned at any potential for escalation that could have devastating consequences for people on both sides of the border.
“We continue to implore all parties to cease their fire, and any interlocutors with influence to urge restraint,” she said.
Arouri, who was killed in a neighbourhood that is a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut, is the first senior Hamas leader to die since 7 October. Analysts say it is difficult to predict how Hezbollah will respond.
Nasrallah, who has led Hezbollah since an Israeli strike killed his predecessor in 1992, has appeared reluctant to escalate the current level of clashes, perhaps fearing a repeat of the month-long 2006 war in which Israel heavily bombed Beirut and southern Lebanon.
His decision will depend on the views of senior leaders in Tehran. Iran guided the foundation of Hezbollah in the aftermath of Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon and has remained an influential sponsor.
Iran’s often bellicose rhetoric may not be matched by action, some analysts suggest, as Tehran now sees Hezbollah’s primary role as providing a threat of retaliation if Israel should strike Iran directly. Iranian officials would therefore be reluctant to risk the most potent member of the “axis of resistance” they have built up across the region in a major war.
“I don’t think Hezbollah will be willing to drag Lebanon into a major conflict at this particular moment and time given the situation regionally,” said Maha Yahya of the Carnegie Middle East Center thinktank.
Israeli officials have warned in recent weeks of action against Hezbollah unless its cross-border fire stops. Tens of thousands  of Israelis remain displaced from their homes along the border with Lebanon for fear of bombardment or a raid.
Military spokespeople said Israeli forces were prepared for any scenario, and Israeli national radio reported the deployment of additional Iron Dome anti-missile batteries.
The US state department said that American officials were monitoring the situation closely. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is due to visit Israel next week.
Observers warn the killing of Arouri is further evidence the war between Israel and Hamas is spreading across the region.  Violence involving other militant groups in the Iran-led “axis of resistance” has flared in recent weeks with Houthi rebels attacking cargo vessels in the Red Sea, a key shipping lane for world trade. 
On Wednesday, the US, UK, Australia and nine other countries warned of unspecified consequences unless the Houthis halt such attacks, but it was unclear what impact such calls would have.
There has been violence, too, in Syria, Iraq and in the occupied West Bank – the Palestinian territory where Arouri was born. Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets of Ramallah and other towns in the West Bank to condemn his killing, chanting “revenge, revenge”, and the Palestinian Authority called a general strike to mourn his death.
In Israel, the assassination was widely welcomed. A headline in the Israel Hayom local newspaper called Arouri a “mass murderer” and hailed “an appropriate end for the man responsible for countless terrorist attacks”. In the mass-market Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, the columnist Nahum Barnea wrote that Arouri “earned his well-deserved spot” on Israel’s hitlist.
With Israeli military casualties mounting, resistance continuing and the most senior Hamas leaders still unharmed, Israeli officials have been under increasing pressure to show results to boost domestic morale. Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the assault in Gaza until Hamas is destroyed and the more than 100 hostages taken on 7 October and still held by the militant group in Gaza are freed.
The campaign has driven about 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed.  Israel’s siege of the territory has left a quarter of Gaza residents facing starvation , according to the UN.
Palestinians reported heavy airstrikes and artillery shelling in the southern city of Khan Younis and farming areas to the east.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israel bombed its headquarters in the city, killing five people, and after a strike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Tuesday Palestinians rushed to rescue victims and retrieve bodies from the rubble.
“There are about 12 martyrs so far, mostly children,” said a bereaved resident, Ghazi Darwish. “What was their fault? Among them my one-month-old son, what did he do to Israel? My other son is five years old, he was also martyred.”
Further south in Khan Younis, the Palestinian Red Crescent said Israel had twice struck its headquarters, killing five people, on Tuesday.
The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, deplored the strikes as “unconscionable” and said “Gaza’s health system is already on its knees”.

A spokesman for Abbas said after the meeting that the Palestinian president had called for an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. 
Al Jazeera reported small protests against the visit took place.                                                                                                                                The US said Blinken                         reaffirmed the US commitment to the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance and resumption of essential services in Gaza and made clear that Palestinians must not be forcibly displaced.  It has refused to back calls for a ceasefire, arguing that it would allow Hamas to re-group.                                                                                          Blinken also visited Cyprus, where he spoke to president Nikos Christodoulides about Cypriot proposals for a maritime humanitarian corridor to deliver aid to Gaza.                                                                                          Israel says that in the combined activities of its ground, air and naval forces in the Gaza Strip, “over 2,500 terror targets have been struck”.  Israel launched the campaign on 7 October after the surprise Hamas  attack inside Israel’s borders that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, and during which at least 240 people were abducted and taken into Gaza as hostages.                                                                                           It is reported that at least 9,770 Palestinians, including 4,008 children, have been killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip since 7 October.  In addition, the Palestinian Authority health ministry in the Israeli-occupied West Bank says that 152 Palestinians have been killed and 2,100 wounded since 7 October. The claims have not been independently verified.                                                                                          IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari has demanded that Hamas stop using hospital facilities in Gaza, saying “we will not accept Hamas’s cynical use of hospitals to hide their terror infrastructures”. In a Sunday afternoon briefing in English, Hagari presented what Israel claimed was evidence that the Indonesia hospital in Bait Lahia was built over existing Hamas infrastructure that Israel had photographed in 2010.                                                                                          Evacuations for civilians and heavily wounded Palestinians from Gaza have been suspended since Saturday, according to Egyptian security and medical sources said, following an Israeli strike on ambulances near the entrance to Gaza City’s main Dar al-Shifa hospital. Israel later claimed Hamas was using an ambulance to move its fighters. The health ministry in Gaza has appealed to Egypt to allow Egyptian ambulances into the Gaza Strip to treat the wounded.                                                                                          The head of the World Food Programme (WFP), Cindy McCain, said on Sunday that the aid entering Gaza was “nowhere near” enough to meet the needs of people there, which she added were growing exponentially.  “We need to continue to work together to get safe and sustained access to Gaza at a scale that aligns with the catastrophic conditions facing families there,” McCain said in a statement after visiting the Rafah border crossing                                                                                          More than 300 US citizens have left Gaza, but there are still those who remain in the besieged Gaza Strip, White House official Jonathan Finer told the CBS show Face the Nation.                                                                                          More than 100 Britons have been evacuated from Gaza  and the government hopes more will be able to leave, the UK’s deputy prime minister said on Sunday, as he urged the reopening of the Rafah crossing.  Oliver Dowden said “The first thing we are doing is trying to make sure we get the Rafah crossing open again and I’m hopeful we will make progress on that today. Secondly, we are seeking to have these temporary pauses to allow humanitarian aid in and to get our people out”. The UK government has also refused to back calls for a ceasefire.                                                                                          Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said on Sunday that there had been “false” reports on negotiations to release Israeli hostages held in Gaza.  Qatar’s foreign ministry said that efforts to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza required a “period of calm”, and that leaks from the negotiations are “harmful” and make it difficult for mediators to do their jobs.                                                                                          The French foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, said in Doha on Sunday that too many civilians had died in Israeli strikes on Gaza.  Colonna added that an international humanitarian conference, to be hosted by France on 9 November, would cover respecting international law, basic needs such as health, water, energy and food, and would call for concrete action to help civilians in Gaza.                                                                                          Pope Francis made an urgent plea for a halt to the conflict in Gaza on Sunday, calling for humanitarian aid and help for those injured in order to ease the “very grave” situation.  “I keep thinking about the grave situation in Palestine and Israel where many people have lost their life. I pray you to stop in the name of God, cease the fire,” he said, speaking to crowds in St Peter’s Square after his weekly Angelus prayer.                                                                 The World Health Organization in Palestine has issued an updated bulletin in which it says it has documented 102 attacks on healthcare facilities within the Gaza Strip since 7 October.                                                                                          An Israeli drone struck near two ambulance on their way to pick up casualties from overnight strikes in southern Lebanon, wounding four paramedics, local officials have claimed.                                                                                          Netanyahu has sought to distance himself from comments by a minister in his government that dropping a nuclear bomb on Gaza  is “one of the possibilities” and that the Palestinian population can “go to Ireland or deserts”.  Heritage minister Amichai Eliyahu of the Otzma Yehudit party  made the comments in a radio interview. Netanyahu said the statements “are not based in reality” and suspended Eliyahu from cabinet meetings. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for him to be fired, saying the comments harmed Israe’s “international standing”.                                                                 Scotland’s first minister, Humza Yousaf, has posted an image to social media of his family reunited after his in-laws were trapped inside Gaza by the Israeli blockade and the closure of the Rafah crossing with Egypt.                                                                                
 I am pleased to say my in-laws are safe and back home ????????? ???????? We are, of course, elated, but my father-in-law said, ""My heart is broken in two, and with my mum, son & grandchildren in Gaza."" He then broke down telling me how hard it was saying goodbye to them. pic.twitter.com/rJxccT6SkQ  — Humza Yousaf (@HumzaYousaf) November 5, 2023

Hamas’s armed wing said more than 60 hostages were missing due to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.  Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam brigades, also said on Hamas’s Telegram account that 23 bodies of Israeli hostages were trapped under the rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the statement.                                                                                          The Committee to Protect Journalists  has said that more media workers have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war than in any other conflict in the area since it started monitoring in 1992.  As of Friday, 36 media workers — 31 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese — have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, according to the group.                                                                                          Agence France-Presse has called on Israel ot provide “an in-depth and transparent investigation” into the exact involvement of its army after a strike severely damaged its office in Gaza City, which has been shelled for weeks. “A strike on the offices of an international news agency sends a deeply troubling message to all the journalists working in such difficult conditions in Gaza,” the news agency’s chairman and CEO Fabrice Fries said.

Gaza residents told to move south as Israel prepares for expected ground assault

Highlight: UN says Israeli military has given 1.1 million Gaza residents 24 hours to move amid warnings it could cause ‘devastating humanitarian consequences’Israel-Hamas war – latest updates
Body


Israel’s military has delivered sweeping evacuation orders for almost half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people before an expected ground offensive aiming to eradicate the Hamas militant group after its unprecedented assault on Israel, UN officials said.
In Gaza, the evacuation order sent panic through civilians and aid workers already struggling under Israeli airstrikes and a blockade.
The Israeli military sent one evacuation order directly on Friday morning, warning the hundreds of thousands of civilians of Gaza City to flee further south into the Gaza Strip, a narrow coastal territory. Israel’s directive charged that Hamas militants were hiding in tunnels under the city.
“This evacuation is for your own safety,” the Israeli military said, in a warning it said was sent to Gaza City civilians.
Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN secretary general, told news outlets that UN officials working in Gaza were told by the Israel Defence Forces “that the entire population of Gaza north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours”, adding that this amounted to approximately 1.1 million people.
Dujarric said the same order applied to all UN staff and those sheltered in UN facilities – including schools, health centres and clinics. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) is sheltering more than 60% of the 423,000 people displaced in recent days in the Gaza Strip.
It was not immediately clear how many people were located north of Wadi Gaza.
“The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences,” Dujarric said. “The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”
Meanwhile, in the divided city of Jerusalem, people are bracing for midday prayers at the flashpoint al-Aqsa mosque compound: Israel has barred men under 60 from entering the area, according to the Jordanian Waqf, that administers the complex’s Muslim holy sites, and rightwing Jewish groups have called on Israelis to bar Palestinians from access.
Thousands of worshippers are expected to try to attend Friday prayers at the site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, which is accessed through the Old City’s maze of narrow streets and alleyways.
Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said: “The UN’s response to Israel’s early warning to the residents of Gaza is shameful.” Erdan said the UN should focus on condemning Hamas and supporting Israel’s right to self-defence.
Salama Marouf, the head of the Hamas government media office, said the relocation warning was an attempt by Israel “to broadcast and pass on fake propaganda, aiming to sow confusion among citizens and harm our internal cohesion”.
The warning came after Iran’s foreign minister said the continuation of crimes against Palestinians would spark a response from “the rest of the axis”, as Israel continued bombing Gaza.
Hossein Amir-Abdollahian did not give further details, but the axis of resistance refers to an alliance among Iran, Palestinian militant groups, Syria, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and other factions.
Amid concerns about a widening of the conflict, Hamas called on Palestinians to rise up on Friday in protest against Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, urging them to march to al-Aqsa mosque and clash with Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank.
Israel has been pounding Gaza for days in retaliation for the Hamas rampage that has killed at least 1,300 Israelis, according to the public broadcaster Kan, the deadliest attack on civilians in Israeli history. More than 1,500 Palestinians, a third of them children, have been killed in the retaliatory strikes, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and there are widespread concerns about a humanitarian crisis in the enclave.  The Israeli air force said on Thursday it had dropped 6,000 bombs on Gaza since Saturday.
Human Rights Watch on Thursday accused Israel of using white phosphorus munitions in operations in Gaza and Lebanon, saying the use of such weapons puts civilians at risk of serious and long-term injury. Asked for comment on the allegations, Israel’s military said it was “currently not aware of the use of weapons containing white phosphorous in Gaza”. It did not provide comment on the rights watchdog’s allegations of their use in Lebanon. White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings, but it is considered an incendiary weapon under Protocol III of the convention on the prohibition of use of certain conventional weapons. The protocol prohibits using incendiary weapons against military targets located among civilians, although Israel has not signed it and is not bound by it.
A ground offensive in Gaza is likely to bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting. Israel has mobilised an unprecedented 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near the strip, and evacuated tens of thousands of nearby residents.
Scores of Israeli and foreign hostages were taken back to Gaza; Israel said it had identified 97 so far. Israeli ministers has said there will be no humanitarian break to its siege of the Gaza Strip until all its hostages are freed, amid growing concern over dwindling water, food and fuel supplies.
UN experts have condemned the Israeli bombardment as “collective punishment”, which is a war crime. 
Late on Thursday, Israel’s parliament approved Benjamin Netanyahu’s emergency unity government, including a number of centrist opposition lawmakers, with the prime minister warning of “difficult days ahead” but determined to achieve “complete victory”.
Lt Col Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesperson, told reporters that forces were preparing for a ground assault in Gaza but that the political leadership had not yet ordered one. Netanyahu has vowed to “crush and destroy” Hamas.
Israel’s bombing campaign has destroyed 752 residential and non-residential buildings, comprising 2,835 housing units, the UN says, citing numbers from the Gaza ministry of public works and housing. Another nearly 1,800 housing units have been damaged beyond repair and rendered uninhabitable, it said.
The US has pledged to send more arms to Israel  ahead of the expected ground assault, as Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, arrived in Tel Aviv  to offer US backing to Israel “today, tomorrow, every day”.
Blinken is expected to meet the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Friday as well as visit key US allies Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates – some with influence over Hamas, an Islamist group backed by Iran.
Blinken is to be joined in Israel on Friday by the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin,, who also planned to meet Netanyahu. The US military is placing no conditions on its security assistance to Israel, Austin said earlier, adding Washington expected Israel’s military to “do the right things” in its war against Hamas.
The presidents of the European Commission and parliament will visit Israel on Friday to “express solidarity with the victims of the Hamas terrorist attacks, and meet with Israeli leadership”.

Highlight: Israeli forces pushing towards southern city of Khan Younis and engaged in battles for key urban areas in the northIsrael-Hamas war – live updates
Body


As the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said they were pushing ahead with the second phase of the ground offensive against Hamas, towards the southern city of Khan Younis, it became clear they were still involved in intense combat to control substantial areas of northern Gaza.
Gen Yaron Finkelman, the head of the IDF’s southern command, said on Tuesday: “We are in the most intense day [of fighting] since the beginning of the ground operation in terms of Hamas terrorists killed, the number of encounters with the enemy and the volume of fire our forces use, both from the ground and the air. We intend to continue attacking.”
Despite pushing into the centre of Gaza City, including to the main hospital, Dar al-Shifa, the IDF is still engaged in heavy fighting for key urban areas in the north, which it says Hamas and other factions use as strongholds, including Jabalia refugee camp and Shuja’iya on the east of Gaza City. Other officials said the IDF was now operating inside Shuja’iya and Jabalia, which have been described as the last Hamas strongholds in the north.
Since the collapse of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas during which militant-held hostages were swapped for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, the Israeli military has launched an intense campaign of airstrikes and ground fighting in the southern Gaza Strip as well.
Underlining the sense that worse fighting may be ahead as Israel tries to advance into some of the most dense urban areas, an Israeli government spokesperson said on Tuesday that the next phase would be challenging.
The IDF spokesperson Lt Col Richard Hecht described the fighting in the north as “close quarter and face to face”. Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi described it as the third phase of the war overall, following the initial aerial offensive and the ground incursion into northern Gaza.
On Monday the IDF announced the death of three more soldiers in fighting in northern Gaza, bringing the Israeli military death toll during the ground offensive to 74. 
It is clear that Israeli forces control a number of significant locations, including large parts of the main Salah al-Din north-south road, and have cut Gaza into at least two sectors with the apparent intention of cutting off Khan Younis too from the southern-most part of the strip. What is less certain is the exact status of a number of key urban centres.
Jabalia is a case in point. The largest of the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, which were first established in 1948, Jabalia is home to more than 100,000 people, who live in a dense network of lanes and streets occupying 1.4 square kilometres. It is the closest of Gaza’s refugee camps to the Israeli border, located not far from the main Erez crossing.
The IDF made claims to have encircled the Jabalia area earlier in the conflict, but a statement saying it had completed the encirclement of the refugee camp only this week suggests that those battles are far from complete even as the IDF has switched its focus to southern Gaza.
For their part, Palestinian fighters have launched attacks on Israeli forces along the route of Fallujah Road in Jabalia and around the Sheihk Radwan area south-west of Jabalia.
The fighting in key areas of the north comes as the Israeli military has continued to sustain casualties there, while rocket fire from Gaza has continued on a daily basis, including one that struck a kindergarten building in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.
Footage released by the IDF on Monday from an area of an intense fighting where two soldiers were killed showed troops moving from building to building.
Shuja’iya, on the eastern outskirts of Gaza City, is home to a similarly sized population as Gaza’s most populous neighbourhood and was the scene of the battle of Shuja’iya during the 2014 Gaza war between the IDF and Hamas’s Izz ad-Din al-Qassam brigades. It has been described in the past as a “terrorist fortress”.
While covering a large area – 6 sq km – it is still one of Gaza’s densely populated areas. During the battle there in July 2014, Israeli troops ran into a series of heavy ambushes after encountering little early resistance.
In the south, the focus of the Israeli offensive has been Khan Younis, with Israeli forces advancing from eastern border villages towards Bani Suheila, a town just to the east of Khan Younis on the main road approaching the city.
Halima Abdel-Rahman, who fled to the town earlier in the war from her home in the north, said they could hear explosions throughout the night. “They are very close,” she said. “It’s the same scenario we saw in the north.”
Satellite photos from Sunday showed about 150 Israeli tanks, armoured personnel carriers and other vehicles just under 6km (4 miles) north of the heart of the city. Other tanks approached even further to the outskirts of Hamid City, a Qatari-built housing development.
The Israeli deployment sits just to the west of Salah al-Din, the main north-south corridor within the Gaza Strip that many used to flee. An AP analysis found positions in four clusters. Israeli soldiers have created packed dirt berms around some of their positions, which can be used for cover.
A sense of scepticism over the progress of the campaign was provided by the veteran columnist Nahum Barnea, who suggested in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that pressure from Washington over the expanded Israeli campaign in the south, where 1.8 million of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million are now concentrated, would limit its scope.
“A sober observation of the options currently available leads to the conclusion that the ground fighting in Khan Younis will not be able to last longer than 10 days to two weeks,” he wrote.
“The combination of 2 million evacuees – 1.8 million from the northern Gaza Strip and 200,000 new ones from Khan Younis – plus American pressure, dictate the limitations of the operation. There is also a danger of friendly fire. In that regard, the price we are paying in the northern Gaza Strip is extremely troubling. Khan Younis is liable to exact a similar price.”

Highlight: In today’s newsletter: Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have been wounded and killed since Saturday morning, with Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning of a ‘long and difficult war’ after Hamas attack Sign up here for our daily newsletter, First Edition
Body


Good morning.
At about 6:30am local time on Saturday, Hamas, the Palestinian para-military group, launched an unprecedented, surprise attack by land, air and sea , firing thousands of rockets from Gaza and launching an incursion into southern Israel taking over several Israeli towns. The offensive, which Hamas have called “Operation Al-Aqsa Flood”, took place a day after the 50th anniversary of the 1973 Yom Kippur war and caught the Israeli government and military completely off guard. It has been described as an “ intelligence failure for the ages  ”.
Both the Israeli military and Hamas  have confirmed that Israeli civilians and military personnel have been taken hostage. As of this morning, at least 700 Israelis  have been killed and 100 are thought to have been taken captive. Israel’s retaliation has killed over 413 Palestinians, including 78 children in Gaza, and injured a further 2,000. That number is expected to continue to rise. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has responded quickly and unsparingly to the attack, vowing to turn “all the places that Hamas hides in” into “rubble”. Save the Children has denounced the violence, adding that the magnitude of the attacks in Israel and Gaza will have consequences that will last long after the immediate crisis.
There has been widespread international condemnation of Hamas’s offensive  : Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer both said Israel has an absolute right to defend itself; the US announced it was sending military support to Israel and many other western, African and Latin American countries disavowed Hamas’s actions. Russia, China, Turkey and several Arab states issued general appeals for restraint, while Iran solely blamed Israel for the violence.
Today’s newsletter is a rundown of what has happened so far and why.
                   Five big stories                   
                                            Germany  | Germany’s opposition conservatives have held ground in the key states of Hesse and Bavaria  in elections that highlighted discontent with Olaf Scholz’s centre-left government amid worries about economic slowdown and migration.
                                            Labour  | Rachel Reeves will announce today  that a Labour government would create a powerful Covid corruption commissioner to help recoup billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money that has been lost to waste, fraud and flawed contracts during the pandemic.
                                            Health  | Mental healthcare in England has become “ a national emergency  ”, with “overwhelmed” services unable to cope with a big post-Covid surge in people needing help, NHS bosses say.
                                            Conservatives  | Working-class people who were a key part of the coalition of voters that delivered the Conservatives’ 2019 general election win have been deserting the party in droves under Rishi Sunak’s leadership, polling by YouGov has found. Only 44% of working-class voters  who voted for the Tories in 2019 say they will back the party next time.
                                            Spain  | Tens of thousands of people have joined conservative and far-right Spanish political leaders in Barcelona to protest against the Socialist party’s decision  to consider an amnesty for those involved in the failed, unlawful and unilateral push for Catalan independence six years ago.
                   In depth: ‘Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known’                   
On the last day of the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, sirens were heard as far as Tel Aviv , alerting people to a barrage of rockets that were heading from the Gaza Strip. Hamas said they had launched 5,000 rockets – the IDF’s figure stood at 2,200. At the same time, Palestinian gunmen had entered Israel. Within hours, militants had infiltrated three military bases and raided the border towns of Sderot, Be’eri, and Ofakim. 
Israel have said more than 100 hostages, including women and children, have been taken into Gaza by Hamas, which hugely complicates any Israeli military operation to free them, Peter Beaumont reports.  The hostages include festival-goers who were attending an all-night party celebrating the Jewish holiday near the Gaza-Israel border, where 260 bodies  were later found. Airlines have suspended flights into Tel Aviv, all schools across Israel and Gaza are closed and businesses have pulled their shutters down. For now, life has come to a halt.
***
                     How has Israel responded?                   
Prime minister Benjamin Netanyhu vowed to destroy Hamas and launched a large scale offensive, firing a wave of retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, destroying dozens of buildings. In a televised statement  he said: “Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known. We are in a war and we will win it.”
He also told Gaza residents to “get out of there now” ahead of an Israeli military attack. However, they have no way to get out. Since 2007 Gaza has been under a full land, sea and air blockade, leading many to question where Gaza residents were expected to go as the borders into Israel and Egypt have been shut. Approximately 20,000 people have taken shelter in United Nations schools and hospitals.
Israeli warplanes continued “intense” strikes in the territory, and have targeted several buildings in the centre of Gaza City, including Palestine Tower, an 11-storey building that houses Hamas radio stations, a mosque in Khan Yunis, a school where 225 people were said to be sheltering from rocket fire and Watan Tower which services as a hub for internet providers. Most areas are without electricity as Israel has stopped supplying Gaza with power and fuel, as well as food and water.  The unending shelling has made Gaza’s already dire humanitarian situation even worse, with under-equipped hospitals making appeals for blood donors.
***
                     Why did this happen?                   
Hamas said the attack was in response to the scenes of Israeli settlers praying inside the compound of al-Aqsa mosque in East Jerusalem and due to the treatment that Palestinians have faced over the decades. The area around the mosque is religiously significant to Jewish people and Muslims alike. Jews are not allowed to pray inside al-Aqsa compound, doing so, according to Guardian analysis , is highly provocative.
Experts and analysts however have said that the attack was not solely caused by these events – not least because this offensive would have taken months of preparation and planning. The incursion follows recent surges of conflict in Jerusalem and the Israeli-occupied West Bank: 2022 was one of the deadliest  years for West Bank Palestinians with at least 146 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces. In February, there was a settler attack in Huwara  so violent that the Israeli military called it a pogrom  (a violent riot incited with the aim of massacring or expelling an ethnic or religious group).
There has also been a marked escalation in the number of attacks against Israelis as the political situation has deteriorated in recent years: in 2022 , 29 Israelis and two foreign nationals, 27 of which were civilians, were killed in attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs, the deadliest year for Israelis since 2015.
The election of Israel’s hard right government, and the de facto annexation of the West Bank which began earlier this year , demonstrated how unstable the situation had become. A poll that was conducted towards the end of last year found that support for the peace process had plummeted to an all time low: Palestinian support for armed struggle was increasing and more and more Israelis believed that they should go to war.
***
                     The global context                   
In his analysis, Peter Beaumont pointed towards the US-brokered normalisation deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia  as a significant factor. “The reality is that while Hamas has dressed up the attack as a response to Israeli incursions around the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, it chose to trigger this conflict – at this time and in the way it did – as a way to impose itself in that wider diplomacy,” Beaumont writes.
The attack has happened during a highly sensitive diplomatic moment that could see an alliance between the two countries – a situation that would be alarming for Iran and Hamas. Patrick Wintour’s analysis  provides comprehensive insight into how this will change the picture of Middle Eastern diplomacy.
***
                     What will happen next?                   
Hamas leaders have called on Palestinians to join the fight and “sweep away the [Israeli] occupation”, meanwhile the Israeli military has called for mass mobilisation of its army reserves. The IDF has said that it has secured 22 locations but is continuing to sweep through others.
And there are growing concerns that the outbreak of violence could spark a broader regional conflict that could draw in Lebanon’s military group, Hezbollah. A sizeable war will cause significant civilian casualties, on both sides, and is unlikely to stabilise a region that has long simmered with unresolved tensions.

The aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel dominates the front pages on Monday. The Guardian leads with “Violence escalates as death toll surges to over 1000”. Framing a picture of an Israeli soldier killed in the attacks, the Times headlines “Stunned Israel goes to war”. The Financial Times says “Israel at war after deadly Hamas attack”.
The Telegraph reports “US sends warships and jets to help Israel”, while the i says “Fears grow for 100 hostages”. The Mail runs images of some of the hostages with the headline “Pawns of merciless terrorists”.
Elsewhere, the Mirror has an interview with Shadow Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, under the headline “Put your trust in me”. Finally, the Sun reports on a feud between former Britain’s Got Talent judges with “Cowell: David’s a wally”.

                     From Blair to Starmer: Labour’s path to power – part 1                   
In 1996, Labour was way ahead in the opinion polls with their sights set on an election campaign expected the following year. The party had been out of power for 17 years and faced a Conservative party beset by scandals, bereft of ideas and heading for oblivion. The party was led by Tony Blair, a former lawyer who had taken on the left of his party and won internal policy battles with a pitch for the centre ground. The parallels with the present day could barely be clearer.
In the first of two parts looking back at that period, political correspondent Kiran Stacey hears from those who were around Tony Blair at the time  : Labour’s campaign strategist Peter Mandelson, the director of communications, Alastair Campbell, the policy chief, David Miliband, the MP Harriet Harman and the political adviser Liam Byrne.

                     A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad                   
It’s been estimated that emissions from livestock (mostly cows) account for about 14% of global climate emissions , that’s a third of human-caused methane emissions. That’s part of the reason there’s been such a focus on cutting meat consumption, which has led Conservative politicians to rail against so-called “meat bans”.
But research from Sweden offers some hope for a solution.  A report from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency into feeds that can reduce methane emissions says development in the field has been “rapid in recent years” and there are “a number of new interesting additives with higher potential”. Among the additives cited in the report were the seaweed red algae, which according to manufacturers can reduce the methane emissions of animals by up to 90%. It’s still in the early stage of research, but could offer an alternative to trying to persuade millions to give up their burger habit.

Body


Joe Biden has presented an unapologetic defence of his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, arguing that Hamas represents a continuing threat to Israel and that Israeli forces were seeking to avoid civilian casualties.
After a summit meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the Apec summit in San Francisco, Biden told reporters on Wednesday night that Hamas had pledged to continue its attacks on Israel.
Biden also argued that Israeli forces had switched from aerial bombardment, which he seemed to acknowledge had been indiscriminate in parts, to more targeted ground operations, after more than 11,000 Palestinians are reported to have died.
He said: “It is not carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They’re going through these tunnels, they’re going into the hospital. They’re also bringing in incubators or bringing in other means to help people in the hospital, and they’ve given, I’m told, the doctors and nurses and personnel the opportunity to get out of harm’s way. So this is a different story than I believe it was occurring before, the indiscriminate bombing.”
Biden added: “The IDF … acknowledge they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It’s not like they’re rushing to the hospital knocking on doors, you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.”
Biden repeated a claim he made last month that babies had been beheaded in the Hamas attack.
“Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, cutting babies’ heads off, burning women and children alive,” he said. “So the idea that they’re going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic.”
The White House clarified last month that US officials had not seen evidence of this and that Biden was referring to news reports. It was not immediately clear if new intelligence had emerged confirming such actions.
Reports that Hamas beheaded babies in the 7 October attack on Israeli civilians remain unconfirmed but the brutality of the massacre in which about 1,200 people were killed is not in doubt. The Israeli military made the claim in the first few days after 7 October.
Biden also suggested that a possible hostage deal was imminent, saying the Israelis had agreed to a “pause” as part of the deal, but then stopped short, appearing to acknowledge the uneasiness of the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, finally adding: “I’m mildly hopeful.”
On Thursday morning, the IDF said Israeli fighter jets had struck the house of the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Gaza. In a social media post that included a video said to show the strike, the IDF said the home “was used as terrorist infrastructure and a meeting point for Hamas’s senior leaders to direct terrorist attacks against Israel”.
Israeli police said on Thursday that they had shot and “neutralised” a suspect in a shooting attack at the Tunnels checkpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, adding that large forces were deployed to the scene.
Israeli forces dropped leaflets warning Palestinians to flee parts of southern Gaza, residents told the Associated Press on Thursday, signalling a possible expansion of operations to areas where hundreds of thousands of people who heeded earlier evacuation orders are crowded.
The leaflets, dropped in areas east of the southern town of Khan Younis, warned civilians to evacuate the area and said anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions “is putting his life in danger”.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Wednesday that the ground operation would eventually “include both the north and south. We will strike Hamas wherever it is.”
The UN security council backed a resolution on Wednesday calling for “ urgent extended humanitarian pauses  for [a] sufficient number of days to allow aid access” into Gaza.
The resolution, the first to be adopted after four previous failures, calls for humanitarian corridors across the Gaza Strip and urges the release of all hostages held by Hamas.
The US and the UK, two potentially veto-wielding powers, abstained on the grounds that although they supported the emphasis on humanitarian relief, they could not give their full support because it contained no explicit criticism of Hamas.
It is the first UN resolution on the Israel-Palestine conflict since 2016.
In an address to the security council in effect announcing that Israel would not abide by the resolution, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, said: “This council has just adopted a resolution that is regretfully detached from the reality on the ground. This council … still has not succeeded in condemning Hamas’s October 7 massacre. The resolution focuses solely on the humanitarian situation in Gaza [and] makes no mention of what led up to this moment.
“Israel does not need a resolution to remind us to adhere to international law. Israel always adheres to international law. Bringing our hostages home is Israel’s top priority. Israel will continue to do whatever it takes to accomplish this goal.”
UN resolutions are in theory legally binding but are widely ignored, and the political significance lies in the US’s willingness to back a call for an extended humanitarian ceasefire.
The resolution came amid condemnation of Israel’s decision to send troops into al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, marking an escalation of Israel’s offensive against Hamas.
“Hospitals are not battlegrounds,” said the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “We’ve lost touch again with health personnel at the hospital. We’re extremely worried for their and their patients’ safety.”
Late on Wednesday, the IDF released a video that it said showed some of the material recovered from a building in the large hospital complex, including automatic weapons, grenades, ammunition and flak jackets.
Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesperson, said in the video: “These weapons have absolutely no business being inside a hospital.”
Hamas denied the claim, which it said was “nothing but a continuation of the lies and cheap propaganda through which [Israel] is trying to give justification for its crime aimed at destroying the health sector in Gaza”.
On Wednesday evening, the chief Israeli military spokesperson, R Adm Daniel Hagari, said troops had found weapons, combat gear and technological equipment at Shifa, and were continuing their search of the complex.
Israel has so far presented in public only limited evidence in support of its claim that a command complex lies under al-Shifa. It is widely accepted that Hamas has an extensive tunnel network across Gaza.

Highlight: Israel claims to have destroyed 130 Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip; G7 foreign ministers in Tokyo call for a ‘humanitarian pause’
Body


                                                                                        Israel has claimed to have destroyed 130 Hamas tunnels in the Gaza Strip since it began its ground operations.  In videos posted to social media by the IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari, it showed what it said was evidence of the destruction. Hagari said “As part of the ground forces’ activity in the Gaza Strip, an effort is under way to uncover and destroy the tunnels of the terrorist organization Hamas, and since the beginning of the fighting, 130 tunnels have been destroyed.”                                                                                          Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are encircling Gaza City and operating inside it.  In a televised statement on Tuesday, Netanyahu said there would be no ceasefire  before hostages were released and urged people in Gaza to move south “because Israel will not stop”.                                                                                           Netanyahu said                         Israel may consider “tactical little pauses” in fighting to allow the entry of aid or the exit of hostages from the Gaza Strip and said it may govern the territory indefinitely.  The Israeli prime minister told ABC news  in an interview broadcast on Monday night: “Israel will for an indefinite period … have the overall security responsibility [in Gaza] because we’ve seen what happens when we don’t.”                                                                                          Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, also said the IDF were operating in the heart of Gaza City and “tightening the chokehold” around                         it.  In a televised statement on Tuesday, Gallant rejected any humanitarian pauses  without the return of hostages. 
                                                                                         Jonathan Conricus, who is acting as a spokesperson for the Israeli military during the conflict, has described the Hamas leadership inside and outside of Gaza as “dead men walking”. He said “The directive is definitely to kill or capture … all the leaders of Hamas. Those who planned, facilitated, and executed the murderous 7 October massacre in Israel. We’ve said so clearly. All of them are dead men walking. And it’s only a matter of time inside Gaza and outside of Gaza, until these Hamas leaders will either be captured or killed by Israel.”                                                                                          Israel has claimed to kill the senior weapon maker of Hamas, Mohsen Abu Zina. The IDF described him as “an expert in developing strategic weapons and rockets used by Hamas terrorists”.                                                                                          Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesperson, told Sky News in the UK on Wednesday that only 100,000 civilians remained in northern Gaza out of the population of 1.1 million.                                                                                          The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip has said that the number of people killed in Gaza by Israeli military actions since the start of the war on 7 October has risen to 10,569.  It says 4,324 of these are children, and that a further 26,457 Palestinians have been injured. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued from Gaza.                                                                                          Foreign ministers from the G7 called Wednesday for a “humanitarian pause” in the war between Israel  and Hamas to allow essential supplies to be delivered to desperate civilians in Gaza.  Speaking to reporters after a meeting in Tokyo, Japan’s foreign minister, Yoko Kamikawa, said the G7 had confirmed the need for “urgent action to address the humanitarian crisis” in Gaza.  The foreign ministers repeated their condemnation of Hamas’s 7 October on Israel and their support for Israel’s right to self-defence. But they also emphasised the need to comply with international law during the ongoing conflict, Kamikawa added.                                                                                          US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, again rejected calls for ‘a ceasefire in Gaza and Israel on Wednesday.  He told the media in a press briefing in Tokyo “those calling for an immediate ceasefire have an obligation to explain how to address the unacceptable result that would likely bring about. Hamas left in place, with more than 200 hostages, with the capacity and stated intent to repeat 7 October, again, and again and again.”                                                                                          Blinken also set out the US position on what he described as “a pathway to Israelis and Palestinians living side-by-side in states of their own”. He said the only way to “durable peace and security” was “no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza … no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism … No reoccupation of Gaza after the conflict ends. No attempt to blockade or besieged Gaza. No reduction in the territory of Gaza”. He later added that “Gaza cannot be continued to be run by Hamas. It is also clear that Israel cannot occupy Gaza. Now, the reality is that there may be a need for some transition period at the end of the conflict.”                                                                 The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, has said “a move towards a peace-loving Palestinian leadership is the most desired outcome” of the current Israel-Hamas conflict.                                                                 The Palestine Red Crescent Society has said all roads are closed heading to al-Quds hospital, and that “medical teams are unable to leave the hospital to reach the injured persons”.                                                                                          Italy will send a hospital ship near the coast of Gaza to help treat victims of the conflict, Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, said on Wednesday.                                                                                          Spain ’s foreign ministry has confirmed the death of Iván Illarramendi, a 46-year-old Spanish citizen who had been missing from the kibbutz where he lived since the terror attacks on 7 October.                                                                                          South Africa is in the process of issuing a “demarche” to the Israeli ambassador Eliav Belotsercovsky, the director-general of South Africa’s department of international relations and cooperation, Zane Dangor, has said. On Monday, South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, addressing the rising number of casualties within the Gaza  Strip,  said: “We believe the nature of response by Israel has become one of collective punishment.”                                                                                          Germany ’s defence export approvals to Israel so far this year have risen nearly tenfold from last year, with Berlin treating permit requests as a priority since Hamas attacked Israel last month, a German government source has told Reuters.                                                                 The remains of seven Thai nationals killed in Israel  are expected to arrive in Bangkok on Thursday afternoon, Thailand ’s foreign ministry has said.

Highlight: Israel indicated to have provisionally accepted six-week hostage and truce deal, but Palestinian official says: ‘We’re not there yet’
Body


A Hamas delegation was in Cairo on Sunday for talks on efforts to broker a ceasefire in the war in Gaza after indications that Israel had provisionally accepted a six-week phased hostage and truce deal before the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Qatari and US mediators also arrived in the Egyptian capital on Sunday, according to the state-linked Al Qahera News.
Talks involving Israeli negotiators took place in the Qatari city of Doha on Saturday and Hamas is expected to respond on Sunday or Monday as time runs out before the unofficial deadline of 10 or 11 March, when Ramadan starts. The month of fasting is often accompanied by an uptick in violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even in quieter years.
A Hamas official said that if Israel were to meet its demands – which include a complete military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and stepped-up humanitarian aid – this would “pave the way for an agreement within the next 24-48 hours”. Another unnamed Palestinian official told Reuters, however, that a ceasefire deal  was still not imminent, saying: “We’re not there yet.”
A US official said  on Saturday that Israel had “more or less accepted” a deal presented by mediators. However, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has so far refused to pull troops out of Gaza before Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are freed. Israel had yet to confirm it had accepted the truce plan or whether it would attend the Cairo talks. 
Kamala Harris, the US vice president, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and pressed Israel to increase the flow of aid to ease what she called “inhumane” conditions and a “humanitarian catastrophe” among the Palestinian people.
Stemming the bloodshed in Gaza has been a difficult diplomatic task in the nearly five-month-old war sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel in which, according to Israeli figures, about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 abducted.
Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 30,000 people, displaced more than 85% of the 2.3 million-strong population from their homes and left more than half of the strip’s infrastructure in ruins, according to data from Gaza’s health ministry and the UN.
Increasing the flow of aid is crucial. The local health ministry said on Sunday that 16 children had died from malnutrition and dehydration at Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahiya, and the UN has said about a quarter of the 2.3 million population is “one step away from famine”.
Hamas has indicated its negotiating position could be influenced by the deaths of 115 Palestinians in Gaza who were killed after Israeli troops opened fire near a crowd  of people scrambling to get food from an aid convoy on Thursday.
Israel’s military said on Sunday that a preliminary review found its forces did not strike the convoy and that most Palestinians died in a crowd crush, although it acknowledged it fired at individuals who it said posed a threat to soldiers.
The military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari did not give details on the alleged threat but said “an independent, professional and expert body” would do a more thorough examination that would be shared “hopefully in the coming days”.
UN officials visiting al-Shifa hospital the day after the attack said they saw many survivors with gunshot wounds, matching interviews with doctors treating the injured and witness accounts of the incident.
The scale of the looming starvation has pushed the US to start airdropping food into the besieged territory , a move criticised by aid agencies and human rights groups as expensive and ineffective.
Jordan and some other countries have already begun airdrops. On Sunday, local media broadcast footage of screaming Palestinian children running toward food parcels that drifted on black parachutes on to the strip’s Mediterranean coastline. 
A November truce in which about 100 hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinians in Israeli jails collapsed after a week, and progress on a second deal has proved elusive.
With just a week left until Ramadan begins, civilians in Gaza, the relatives of the remaining hostages and international mediators are all aware that time may be running out to broker a comprehensive ceasefire.
Fierce fighting across the strip continues despite the diplomatic talks. Another 90 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said, including twin babies Baeem and Wissam Abu Anza, who were buried on Sunday as their mother, Rania, wept.
A relative, Shehada Abu Anza, said “only civilians” were in the house when it was bombed, killing 14 members of one family. “All of them were sleeping when suddenly a missile hit and destroyed the whole house,” he said as residents searched the rubble with their bare hands for bodies and also to salvage food.
Residents said airstrikes hit Rafah, the strip’s southernmost town, which has become the last place of relative safety for civilians fleeing the fighting, as well as Khan Younis, where Israeli forces are bogged down in ground battles with Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. The Hamas media office also reported intense tank shelling in the northern half of Gaza.
The Israeli military said it had hit about 50 targets, including “underground terrorist infrastructure”.
Critics of Joe Biden say he has opted not to use Washington’s leverage as Israel’s principal arms supplier and most important international ally to force Israel to draw down its campaign or increase the flow of aid to Gaza’s desperate civilians.

Highlight: Senior official vows assault will ‘eliminate Hamas from the roots … everything should go away’Israel and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Israel security officials have signalled their readiness to embark on a ground offensive into Gaza that they say will be far more comprehensive and ferocious than any previous conflict with Hamas.
Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, visited troops on the Gaza border on Thursday, telling them: “You see Gaza now from a distance, you will soon see it from inside. The command will come.”
“I am tasked with leading us to victory,” Gallant told the soldiers. “We will be precise and forceful, and we will keep going until we fulfil our mission.”
Soon after Gallant’s statement, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, broadcast a video of himself with troops near the border also promising victory. At a meeting with his visiting British counterpart, Rishi Sunak,  Netanyahu said: “This is our darkest hour.”
Following a Hamas attack on 7 October that killed at least 1,400 Israelis, mostly civilians, Israel has called up 360,000 reservists, and amassed a huge army around Gaza’s narrow coastal strip, while reinforcing defences on the northern border against the possibility of an attack from Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Joe Biden left Israel after a day of talks on Wednesday, saying that US and Israeli officials had discussed “alternatives”  to a mass ground offensive into Gaza, which will almost certainly cause large-scale civilian casualties. More than 3,000 Palestinians have already died in the enclave from the past 12 days of aerial bombardment.
In a rare Oval Office speech on Thursday night, Biden explicitly backed Israel, calling for billions more in aid while seeking to link Hamas with Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
“Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to annihilate a neighboring democracy,” he said.
Biden also stressed that the US could not “ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians who only want to live in peace and have opportunity.”
Israeli officials are adamant that they have no choice but launch a massive assault, codenamed Operation Swords of Iron. Over the past 16 years since the militant movement seized power in Gaza, they argue, Israel has fought three significant conflicts with Hamas, but they said those campaigns were aimed at keeping Hamas in check rather than destroying it.
“The strategy was to have a longer gap every time between the different conflicts, but it failed and it cannot happen any more,” a senior Israeli security official said. “So the only conclusion is that we have to go in, we have to go in and clean it and to eliminate Hamas from the roots, not only militarily, but also economically, its administration. Everything should go away.”
“That’s the idea now and we are getting prepared for that,” the official said, and warned: “It won’t be clear cut and it won’t be as short as we would like as Israelis. It will be a prolonged campaign. It will take time.”
As apprehension spread across the region of a major war, the Jordanian foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said: “All the indications are that the worst is coming. The catastrophe will have painful consequences in coming periods.”
Diplomatic efforts, Safadi added, had failed to fend off the conflict.
The threat of an all-out ground war loomed just as there was some hope of humanitarian relief reaching the 2.3 million Palestinians trapped in Gaza, who have been cut off from water, food and medical supplies for the past 12 days. Under a deal brokered by Biden on his visit to Israel, the Rafah crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border was due to open on Friday  to allow just 20 lorries of supplies to enter the territory. The Israeli government had said more could follow if the first delivery was not seized by Hamas.
Even this modest delivery was not entirely guaranteed. The state department said on Thursday that the new US special envoy for humanitarian issues, David Satterfield, was still trying to “negotiate the exact modalities” of the agreement, while Egyptian workers started repairing the road running through the Rafah crossing.
Aid agencies have warned that the life-saving assistance, if and when it arrived, was in danger of being too little too late in view of the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
The emergencies director of the World Health Organization, Michael Ryan, said aid needed to get in “every day”, and called the initial convoy of 20 trucks a “drop in the ocean of need right now”.
On a visit to Cairo, the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said: “We need food, water, medicine and fuel now. We need it at scale and we need it to be sustained, it is not one small operation that is required.”
The threat of a ground assault on top of the constant airstrikes, now threatens to cut off even this slim lifeline to Gaza at any moment.
“There will be many injured who will lose their lives if sufficient fuel, medical supplies and life-saving aid is not delivered to hospitals in Gaza which are full of injured civilians from the continuous bombing and Israeli airstrikes,” said Riham Jafari, the communications and advocacy coordinator at ActionAid Palestine.
“Insufficient aid will cause health disasters and starvation as patients with chronic diseases and pregnant women and their infants will be unable to receive the medical care and nutrition they need, and this will endanger their lives. We know that the 20 trucks of aid currently promised is simply not enough.”
Humanitarian agencies have stockpiled life-saving supplies on the Egyptian side of the border, waiting for the crossing to open. The UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, told the UN security council on Wednesday that the organisation sought to bring aid deliveries to Gaza back to 100 trucks a day, the level before the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Griffiths told the security council: “There is simply nowhere to go for civilians to escape the destruction and privation, both of which grow by the hour as missiles continue to fly and essential supplies, including fuel, food, medical items, water run low.
“Due to the scarcity of water, UNRWA [the UN relief agency] in some locations … is being forced to ration down to providing one litre of water per person per day. Bear in mind that the minimum by international standards should be 15 litres, and they’re getting one – and they’re the lucky ones.”

Body


At the start of the second month of the Gaza war, two questions emerge: what kind of conflict are we witnessing and how long will it last? These questions force us to consider longer trends in modern warfare, linked not just to the post-9/11 “ wars on terror  ” but to a more global security paradigm that is about maintaining control, rather than addressing the underlying causes of revolt.
In the immediate aftermath of Hamas’s 7 October assault , Benjamin Netanyahu talked of crushing the organisation so that it could never again threaten Israel. It was eerily similar to George W Bush’s declaration against al-Qaida and the Taliban after 9/11, which had dire consequences, especially for Afghanistan and Iraq.
In a similar vein, and after a month of war, Netanyahu’s intention is to destroy Hamas. This will be followed by long-term control of Gaza, not just fencing it off. As Netanyahu put it  : “Israel will for an indefinite period have the overall security responsibility, because we have seen what happens when we do not have it.” Given the increasing pressure  from West Bank settlers and the rise in violence, a high level of policing and military patrols will be essential there as well.
Even if Hamas can be destroyed in Gaza, which is already looking problematic – if, indeed, it is even possible – the ideas and aspirations behind it will remain, no doubt bolstered  by many tens of thousands of younger people experiencing the full impact of this war.
We need to remember the specific and shocking circumstances that brought us to this point. More than 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed in the violent attacks of 7 October. That was nothing short of catastrophic but was also a terrible loss of control – Israel’s worst civilian loss for 75 years.
This struck at the heart of a state that has perhaps unknowingly lived the paradox of being impregnable in its insecurity. Jews in Israel simply had to feel secure, a need going right back to the experience of the Holocaust and even earlier. They created a very well-armed Israel but one that was opposed by the displaced Palestinians and many millions of people in the surrounding states.
Since 7 October, more than 10,000 Palestinians have already been reported killed in this quest for security, including more than 4,000 children. Large parts of Gaza City have been reduced to rubble, and Israeli control of energy, food and water supplies across the whole Gaza Strip is adding hugely to the suffering.
The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) is now engaged in the slow process of trying to fight the Hamas paramilitaries on their own territory. It is already taking many casualties, with the IDF’s specialist casualty evacuation group, Unit 669, airlifting  about 260 wounded soldiers to Israel in the first few days, well before the main fighting in the dense urban areas fully unfolds.
Recent experience – Russia in Mariupol, western troops in Mosul (2016) , Raqqa  (2017) and Falluja  (2004) – shows that in modern urban warfare the intense use of airpower and bombardment with huge loss of life is all too common. This is now unfolding in Gaza, but, with international criticism rising, time is not on Israel’s side.
How did we get here? Until last month, Israel had ensured its security by heavy use of military and paramilitary forces, persistent control of populations and high levels of surveillance, together with well-resourced intelligence and security agencies. It is a paradigm of control that can be termed “liddism”, keeping the lid on a problem rather than turning down the heat – and it has global significance with potentially disastrous consequences.
Wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere have repeatedly shown the difficulties of using intense force against paramilitaries. Now look at the consequences of those wars, which independent monitoring groups such as Iraq Body Count , Airwars  and Brown University’s Costs of War centre  have helped make public. So far, these post-9/11 wars have killed more than 900,000 people through direct violence and a further 3.5 million indirectly, with 38 million people displaced. 
None has produced, or seems likely to produce, a lasting peace. Conflict continues in Iraq and Syria, including US airstrikes, while Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked militias are active right across the Sahel  region and through to Somalia, with other states such as Uganda, Kenya, the DRC and even Mozambique  affected.
The war in Gaza is a microcosm of a global reliance on military responses to what are, at root, not military problems but problems that often relate to questions of justice, political representation and economic development. Furthermore, Gaza and the Ukraine war have meant a veritable bonanza for the global arms industry, with military spending going through the roof.
The best realistically possible case for Gaza just now is that Netanyahu will have to eventually agree a ceasefire, and sufficient international pressure will open the possibility of a settlement. Beyond that, there still lies the much greater task of rethinking what is even meant by international security if a perpetually unstable world is to be avoided. Liddism won’t work in Gaza and will not work in the wider world.
Fifty years ago, the economic geographer Edwin Brooks warned  of the risk of the world becoming a “crowded glowering plant of massive inequalities of wealth buttressed by stark force yet endlessly threatened by desperate men in the global ghettoes”. That looks decidedly prophetic now. But if an alternative definition of prophecy is “suggesting the possible”, then such an approach is very badly needed now, along with a serious debate  about what is meant by “security”.

Highlight: Netanyahu says ‘full force’ offensive will continue, despite growing concerns over civilian casualtiesIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Israel will continue its offensive in Gaza “with full force” and will refuse any temporary ceasefire that does not include the release of more than 240 hostages held by Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu has said, rejecting US calls for a pause in the fighting.
Earlier on Friday, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, flew into Israel to urge the Israeli prime minister to temporarily stop its military offensive  to allow aid into the territory amid rising concerns over civilian casualties as the fighting intensifies.
The Hamas-controlled health ministry reported on Friday evening that an airstrike had hit a convoy of ambulances outside Gaza’s largest hospital, killing 15 people and injuring 60 others. 
The report could not immediately be independently verified but an Agence France-Presse journalist at the scene reported seeing several bodies beside a damaged ambulance.
The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said they carried out an airstrike on an ambulancethey said was being used by Hamas, adding that “a number of Hamas terrorist operatives” were killed in the strike.
Hamas official Izzat El Reshiq said allegations its fighters were present were “baseless”. Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson for Gaza’s health ministry, said the ambulance was part of a convoy that Israel targeted near Gaza City’s al-Shifa Hospital.
Blinken was in the Middle East for the second time in less than a month trying to avert regional escalation of the conflict but also to balance Washington’s strong support for Israel over the deadly Hamas attack of 7 October with growing concern about civilian casualties inflicted by Israel.
US officials have said they hope a pause in the fighting will allow humanitarian aid to reach desperate civilians in Gaza and help negotiations to free the hostages seized by Hamas  during the attack. Obtaining their liberty is a key objective of the Israeli offensive. So far, four have been freed by Hamas and one rescued by Israeli forces. 
Blinken told reporters at a press conference in Tel Aviv: “A number of legitimate questions were raised in our discussions today, including how to use any period of pause to maximise the flow of humanitarian assistance, how to connect the pause to the release of hostages, how to ensure that Hamas doesn’t use these pauses or arrangements to its own advantage.”
However, Netanyahu said in a later televised statement: “I made clear that we are continuing full force and that Israel refuses a temporary ceasefire which does not include the release of our hostages.”
The Israeli offensive on Gaza followed terrorist attacks launched by Hamas into Israel which killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians massacred in their homes and at a music festival. 
Israeli strikes on Gaza since then have killed at least 9,227 Palestinians, including 3,826 children, the health ministry said on Friday.
In a separate statement, the ministry said Israel had targeted a convoy of ambulances leaving al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. “We have informed the Red Cross in accordance with the international law about moving a convoy carrying injured people in ambulance vehicles from al-Shifa hospital,” Ashraf al-Qudra, the health ministry spokesperson, said. “At the gate of the hospital and then at the Ansar square, the occupation targeted the convoy in more than one location outside al-Shifa hospital.”
Israel’s military said it had identified and hit an ambulance “being used by a Hamas terrorist cell” in the battle zone. It said a number of Hamas fighters had been killed in the strike and accused the group of transferring both militants and weapons in ambulances. 
It gave no evidence to support its assertion that the ambulance was linked to Hamas but said in a statement it intended to release additional information.
Earlier Lt Col Richard Hecht, an IDF spokesperson, said Israeli forces had moved deeper into Gaza City and were engaged in “very, very close quarters combat” as they sought to destroy bases, launchpads and tunnels  used by Hamas to instigate attacks.
Though the fighting in Gaza has remained the main focus of the IDF, clashes with the powerful Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah have escalated along Israel’s northern border.
In his first public statement since the start of the conflict, Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, told a rally in Beirut that “all options” were open for an expansion of the Israel-Hamas conflict into Lebanon and said “we can resort to them at any time”. The fighting on the Lebanon-Israel border would “not be limited” to the scale seen until now, he added.
In recent weeks, Hezbollah has fired rockets across the border daily, mainly hitting military targets in northern Israel, but it has a substantial arsenal capable of hitting anywhere in Israel and many thousands of experienced fighters.
“Some say I’m going to announce that we have entered the battle,” Nasrallah said on Friday. “We already entered the battle on October 8.” He argued that Hezbollah’s cross-border strikes had distracted elite Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza.
Washington has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean in an effort to deter Hezbollah, and its patron Iran.
Israeli officials have said their response to any major attack by Hezbollah would be “very very severe”, but both sides appear to be carefully calibrating their levels of violence and rhetoric to avoid a full-scale confrontation.
Hecht said: “We are powerfully deployed in the north. We are looking at Nasrallah’s speech today. Our message to Lebanon is: don’t sacrifice your future for Hamas and that you have a choice to make. We are in defensive mode.”
Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv that the US had been clear that it was determined there should not be a second or third front in the conflict.
On Friday, the IDF named five of its own soldiers killed while fighting in Gaza, bringing the total who have died on the ground there over the last week to 23.
In the latest fighting, Israeli forces “uncovered and neutralised active combat tunnels”, the IDF said, describing fighters blowing up and booby-trapping parts of the network, and sharing video footage of attacks.
Israel claimed that a Hamas battalion commander, Mustafa Dalul, who it said led forces in Gaza City, was killed overnight. IDF officials have claimed that 130 Hamas fighters were killed on Thursday but have not give a total for those it believes have been killed in the war.
Asked how Israel would know it had reached its goal of destroying Hamas, Hecht said it would be when Hamas’s “leadership is gone, their military capabilities are gone”, so there could never be a repeat of the 7 October attacks.

Highlight: Action on Armed Violence says 33,846 were killed or wounded by airstrikes, bombs or artillery, the most it has recordedMiddle East crisis – live updates
Body


More civilians were recorded as being killed or injured by airstrikes, bombs or artillery during 2023 than in any other year for more than a decade due to the high number of casualties from the three-month war in Gaza, an annual study has said.
Action on Armed Violence (AOAV), a monitoring group, said 33,846 non-combatants had been killed or wounded during 2023, an increase of 62% on last year, and the largest amount it had counted since it began its annual survey in 2010.
The total exceeds the casualty levels recorded at height of the Syrian civil war and early western campaign against Islamic State, between 2013 and 2017, when the total killed and wounded was regularly over 30,000.
AOAV’s figures are based on English-language reports of global incidents of explosive violence, although it is almost certainly an undercount of the numbers killed and wounded, partly because media accounts do not capture all the dead and wounded and partly because initial fatality and injury reports are normally underestimates.
Nonetheless, the group’s use of the same methodology since 2010 allows for a comparison of civilian casualties and the harm caused by explosives globally between each year.
“Last year proved to be the most harmful to civilians from explosive violence since our monitor began in 2010,” said Iain Overton, the group’s executive director. Wars in Ukraine and Sudan also contributed significantly to the total.
Overton said that since 7 October, when the Israel-Gaza war began with Hamas’s surprise attack on southern Israel, there had been “a massive spike” in incidents during the Israeli assault on the territory. He added: “Gaza almost overwhelmed our capacity to record each individual and injurious reported strike.”
AOAV said Israel’s Swords of Iron operation accounted for 37% of all civilian casualties in 2023. In Gaza, where western media do not have access, its data records 9,334 civilians killed and 3,616 injured.
The ministry of health in Gaza, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians, on Monday recorded that 22,835 people had been killed in Gaza and a further 58,416 as wounded since 7 October.
The intensity of the Middle Eastern conflict, in which Israel has struck hundreds of targets a day, meant that the numbers reported as killed and wounded in the Palestinian territory exceeded a whole year’s fighting in Ukraine on 8,351 and Sudan, where civil war broke out in April, on 2,546.
The total number of casualties from explosive violence reported globally was 46,500 people, of which 73% are recorded as civilians, a proportion that rises to 90% in built-up areas. Some 15,305 were reported as killed and the rest, 18,541, were said to be wounded.
Overton said each airstrike in Gaza where civilian harm was reported saw an average of 11.1 civilians reported killed, higher than a previous estimate  and more than four times more deadly than the most aggressive previous Israeli operations. Previously the highest equivalent average was 2.5 deaths.
Overall, 12,950 civilian casualties from explosive violence – death or injury from airstrikes, artillery attacks or other bombs – were recorded by the group in Gaza during 2023 plus a further 420 in Israel. Casualties from shootings, stabbings are not counted in the data.

Highlight: Calls for restraint are right but unlikely to be heeded. A conflict setting Israel and the US against Iran has rarely seemed closer
Body


The foremost concern of western governments as the Israel-Hamas war enters a murderous second week is not the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. It is  the alarming prospect of a swiftly spreading conflict pitting Israeli and US forces against Iran and its militia proxies. Recent, ominous signs  suggest a rapid deterioration. Iran holds the key.
The two issues are intimately connected. Arab leaders told Antony Blinken, the visiting US secretary of state, that unless Israel’s mass casualty attacks on Gaza cease, the war may escalate uncontrollably. “If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,” warned  Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian.
But Israel will not be stopped. A high-risk, full-scale ground offensive into northern Gaza is imminent. Most western leaders surely wish it wasn’t happening. Even James Cleverly, Britain’s seriously clueless foreign secretary, has belatedly urged  restraint. But amid continuing aftershocks from Black Saturday, they feel unable to prevent it.
Escalation begets escalation. The US says its decision to deploy  a second aircraft carrier group in the eastern Mediterranean is intended to bolster Israel’s security and “deter any state or non-state actor” from widening the conflict. That vague wording conceals a world of anxiety about a possible head-on collision with Iran.
Iran is the “state actor” that controls and coordinates the “non-state actors” – Hamas and the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza; Tehran-affiliated militias in Syria, Iraq and Yemen; and the most powerful of them all, Lebanon’s Hezbollah (the “Party of God”). This is what Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calls the “axis of resistance”.
Iran undoubtedly views the additional deployment as an American escalation. It appears to be placing its militias on notice that new war fronts may soon open up. Israel is already fending off daily, limited Hezbollah cross-border attacks in the north, and is warning  of the “destruction of Lebanon” if the militia joins Hamas’s war.
The West Bank is another potential flashpoint amid rising levels of violence in the past week. In a further heightening of tensions, Israel is accusing Iran of deploying  new weapons in or through Syria to create a second front. Syria claims Israel bombed Damascus and Aleppo last week.
What is Iran’s plan, assuming it has one? What does it want? These questions hold the key to the war. In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, US and Israeli officials were quick to say  that there was no evidence, at present, to indicate Iran’s direct involvement. Too quick, perhaps. The suspicion was they wanted to avoid full-on confrontation at that very fraught juncture.
Subsequent reports suggest senior Iranian officials were in close touch with Hamas in the run-up to the attack. Gen Esmail Ghaani, head of the Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Quds force with responsibility for extraterritorial clandestine military operations, is said to have  repeatedly met Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.
Specifically, it is claimed  that Hamas members discussed their plan to mount simultaneous air, land and sea incursions into southern Israel with IRGC officers in Beirut on 2 October, five days before the attack – and were given the green light. Hamas insists it acted of its own volition. Iran welcomed the attack – but denies involvement in it.
Throughout the lengthy “shadow war” with Israel, Iran has typically operated at arm’s length, acting through proxies such as the Houthis in Yemen. The idea that Tehran, which funds, trains and arms Hamas, was not aware of, and was not involved in planning Black Saturday’s large-scale operation is very hard to believe.
Like a man suspected of murder, Iran has previous form and a strong motive  for wanting to take a swipe at Israel now – in addition, that is, to its fundamental objection to the Jewish state’s very existence. Khamenei and Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s hardline president, sense weakness as they watch an Israel convulsed  by Benjamin Netanyahu’s anti-democratic, hard-right policies.
Strategically speaking, the Biden administration’s preoccupation with Ukraine and tilt to Asia look like opportunities, when viewed from Tehran. The Afghan and Iraq withdrawals, and the Syrian regime’s rehabilitation, reinforce the perception that the US is losing leverage, and losing interest, in the Middle East. 
Iran’s increased belligerence also stems from strengthened ties with China and especially Russia, now a big arms customer. Meanwhile, the prospect of a revived nuclear arms control deal with the west has reduced appeal, even if one could be agreed. Khamenei has always argued against a nuclear compromise, saying Iran should ignore US sanctions, become more self-sufficient, and look east.
Hamas’s leader, Ismail Haniyeh, when trying to justify the 7 October attack, cited offensive transgressions near the site of the revered al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, chronic Jewish settler violence and land-grabs in the West Bank, and the 16-year blockade of Gaza.
Iran’s leaders are not so crazy as to support Haniyeh’s extreme call for international jihad and a wider war with the west. After recent turmoil at home, Khamenei is no fan of popular uprisings. But he did have another urgent reason to act.
The trend towards normalisation of relations between Arab states and Israel is anathema to Tehran. It especially hates the prospect – thought to be imminent – of an Israel-Saudi deal backed by US security guarantees. Normalisation has the potential to isolate Tehran politically and economically, unravelling its dreams of regional hegemony.
The 7 October attack has shifted the balance back in Tehran’s favour. Public opinion in the Arab world is furious about Gaza. Sensing the mood, the Saudis have put the Israel deal on ice. Significantly, Raisi and Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, held their first-ever talks last week. This turnabout represents a tangible war dividend for Tehran.
All these factors combine to suggest a bullish Iran feels it has the wind at its back right now. Whether this newfound confidence, combined with a dangerous under-estimation of Israeli and American resolve, will induce Tehran to recklessly up the ante in the coming days is now the central question in this mega-crisis.
A confrontation setting Israel and the US directly against Iran has rarely appeared closer. As Netanyahu keeps saying, this is just the beginning. The war with Hamas could be about to go global.

The plight of Gaza’s ‘WCNSFs’ – wounded child, no surviving family

When Yousef al-Dawi tries to go to sleep in his aunt’s house in Rafah, he thinks about resting his head in his mother’s hands, his father taking him on outings, and most of all, learning to swim with his brother, Mahmoud – taking himself away to a world that no longer exists.
The bomb that fell on his family’s house in Jabaliya at midnight on 23 October killed his whole family and left the 10-year-old pinned under the rubble. It was three days before he regained consciousness in a hospital bed, and his surviving relatives tried to put off breaking the news to him, telling him the rest of his family were in another hospital. Eventually they had to tell him they were all dead.
Since then, he has stayed with different family members, moving on when it was their neighbourhood’s turn to get bombed, eventually making his way to a cousin and his aunt in Rafah. He is at least in a house now, and not a homemade tent like hundreds of thousands of other displaced children. But the shortage of food is the same for everyone and having a roof does not make up for the loneliness.
“When I want to sleep, I remember and dream of my mother, father and brothers, playing with me as we did before the war,” Yousef said. “I was sleeping on the hands of my mother. She was telling me beautiful stories. Now I am not as before. Before, me and my brother Mahmoud played together, and in the summer we went on a swimming course, everything was beautiful there.”
Their swimming teacher, Amjed Tantesh, has pictures of Yousef and Mahmoud in a pool in the summer, holding on to the side, their heads just above the water, Yousef in a bright blue T-shirt.
“We were planning to go on another swimming course together, but now I will go alone next year, and I put all my effort and strength into becoming a professional swimmer like Mahmoud dreamed of being,” Yousef said.
The numbers of Gaza’s dead, wounded and orphaned children are uncertain but there is no question they have borne the brunt of the war, launched after Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people. Unicef, the UN’s children’s fund, estimates that minors account for at least 40% of the estimated 20,000 people killed so far.
“When we speak of a war on children, it’s not to try to be dramatic. It’s rooted in the data,” said James Elder, Unicef’s chief spokesperson, who spent weeks in Gaza under bombardment. “In ‘normal’ past conflicts, the rate was about 20%, so you’re looking at twice the number of children who have been killed and injured compared with previous conflicts.
“That speaks obviously to the severity and the intensity of the bombardment. We believe it also speaks to the indiscriminate nature of the bombardment, and it speaks to a disregard for civilians, particularly children.”
The conflict has filled hospital wards with patients classified by the abbreviation “WCNSF” – “wounded child, no surviving family”. Given the nature of Palestinian extended families, Elder says, there is usually some relative who will take in such traumatised children, but there are always exceptions.
“We had a 14-year-old girl [on Wednesday last week] just walk out of some war zone of Gaza City, stunned, mute, bloodied, and she absolutely had no one,” he said. “How many other children are like that right now? We simply don’t know.”
Another child, a 14-year-old boy called Kareem, recalled how his mother promised him she would make sure that the family stayed close under the relentless Israeli bombardment, so if the worst happened they would at least die together. It was a promise she would break on 3 December when she and Kareem’s father were killed in the bombing of a relative’s house in the Sabra district of Gaza City.
The blast maimed Kareem’s elder sister, Aya, and critically injured their brother Hassan. The oldest boy in the family, Hussein, had already been killed days earlier when the bakery he had gone to in search of bread was hit by an airstrike.
Now only Kareem and his younger brothers, Hossam and Asaad, remain – more or less unscathed, survivors but orphans.
“I was unable to bid farewell to my mother, father and brother, and no funeral was conducted for them,” Kareem said. “My mother feared the prospect of us being left alone or feeling oppressed if any of us were lost. I wish I had departed with them.
“I cannot fathom what life will be like after the loss of my family,” he said. “This pain is unbearable.”
The children are now in the house of an aunt in southern Gaza, and in their grief they must fight to survive. Finding firewood and flour or anything to eat is a daily struggle. Kareem has diabetes. After the war started, his father would risk the bombs to search for insulin and needles in pharmacies and clinics, but he is now no longer there to help forage, and insulin is ever harder to come by. Kareem’s little brother Hossam suffers from stomach cramps, which a doctor has told them comes from drinking contaminated water, but it is the only water available.
Roa’a Alshafie, aged 13, had moved to southern Gaza with her mother, while her father stayed behind close to the family home in the north. Spreading out did not spare them. Her parents were killed by separate airstrikes, a few days apart. The bombing which killed her mother also caused the death of one of her sisters and left Roa’a with injuries to her hand, back and chest. Her father died two days later in a blast at the Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahiya in the north, leaving her two surviving brothers and two sisters as orphans, living with relatives in southern Gaza.
“Before the war, our life was normal. I was going to my school, meeting my friends, my parents and sister were alive, I was feeling safe. My mother was making breakfast for us before school, and my father was working to provide for us,” Roa’a recalled. “Now I can’t sleep well for thinking about my parents, my sister and the pain of my injuries. Now we are orphans. We don’t know when the war will stop.”
For Gaza’s children, there is no end in sight to the horror. Even the relatively lucky ones – those who have not been wounded and still have their parents – are at increasing risk from disease, starvation and exposure as winter approaches. Many of them are in vast camps of makeshift tents that have sprung up in Rafah and elsewhere in the south.
“There’s not enough supplies of food, there’s not enough supply of water, and there is no sanitation,” Jason Lee, the country director for Save the Children International, said by phone from Rafah.
“People have taken to open defecation in the street because there are no toilets. And, of course, children are most disproportionately impacted by this. There’s no healthcare, so they either risk facing starvation [or] dehydration, and we see the rates of gastrointestinal disease increasing.
“And winter is here,” Lee added. “Civilians are sheltering out in the open, and children will be especially susceptible to pneumonia. Pneumonia is one of the world’s greatest killers for children worldwide.”
Elder, the Unicef spokesperson, said there had been 100,000 recorded cases of acute watery diarrhoea among children, though the true numbers are likely to be much higher. Their parents are well aware that going to hospitals would be pointless, as whatever health services that remain are devoted to treating the most traumatic wounds.
“You hear time and again that we need to use whatever parenting skills we’ve got, together with hope, nature and luck,” Elder said. “There is a justified concern that you can get to a point where you start to see similar numbers of children killed through diseases as we’ve seen through bombardment. It is that dire. Things deteriorate by the day and by the hour.”
He added: “For the families, it’s about doing everything you can so your child doesn’t realise that you’ve lost control.”

Highlight: Gadi Eisenkot launches blistering attack on Netanyahu’s campaign, saying ‘total victory’ over Hamas is unlikelyMiddle East crisis – live updates
Body


A senior minister in the Israeli war cabinet has said that only a ceasefire deal can win the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza , and that Israel is unlikely to achieve its aim of “total victory” over the militant Islamist group.
Gadi Eisenkot, a former chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, launched a blistering attack on the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of the campaign against Hamas and failure to take responsibility for the failures that led to the bloody attack into Israel in October that triggered the current conflict.
With Israeli military casualties approaching 200, rockets fired by Hamas continuing to fall on Israel and a bitter rift with Washington increasingly evident, concern is mounting in Israel at the apparent lack of progress towards the “total victory” that Netanyahu has said is the aim of the campaign.
Netanyahu invited Eisenkot, a political opponent, to be part of a five-man war cabinet formed shortly after the attacks, in which 1,200 Israelis died, mostly civilians. A second former general and political rival, Benny Gantz, the leader of National Unity, also joined.
Eisenkot, whose 25-year-old son was killed in December while fighting in Gaza, told the investigative programme Uvda on Israel’s Channel 12 television channel that “the hostages will only return alive if there is a deal, linked to a significant pause in fighting”.
He said dramatic rescue operations like the famous raid that freed more than 200 Israelis held at Entebbe airport in Uganda in 1976 were unlikely because the hostages were apparently spread out, many of them in underground tunnels.
Claiming hostages could be freed by means other than a deal “is to spread illusions”, he said.
In a thinly veiled criticism of Netanyahu, Eisenkot said strategic decisions about the war’s direction must be made urgently, and that a discussion about an endgame should have begun immediately after the war began.
The former general also dismissed suggestions that the military had delivered a decisive blow against Hamas. “Whoever speaks of absolute defeat [of Hamas] is not speaking the truth,” Eisenkot said in the interview. “That is why we should not tell stories … Today, the situation already in the Gaza Strip is such that the goals of the war have not yet been achieved.”
Eisenkot’s comments  late on Thursday were the latest sign of deep disagreement among political and military leaders over the direction of Israel’s offensive on Hamas.
The Israeli assault has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip, displacing more than three-quarters of its 2.3 million people and killing 25,000, mostly civilians, according to Palestinian officials.
Central to the disputes inside the war cabinet is the question of how to free the more than 130 hostages who remain in Gaza. Not all of them are believed to be alive and there is a growing sense in Israel that time is running out.
The arguments are mirrored in wider Israeli society.
Lilach Shoval in Israel Hayom, a rightwing newspaper, wrote: “Fifteen weeks have elapsed since Hamas forced this war on Israel on that Black Saturday of October 7, and Israel remains far from achieving the goals it set for itself: toppling Hamas’s military and governing ability, and returning the captives, not necessarily in that order.” Others have described a “quagmire”. 
Mairav Zonszein, an Israel analyst with the International Crisis Group, said: “There is no lack of support for the war but it is increasingly clear that the release of the hostages is in conflict with other goals.”
A poll published in Ma’ariv newspaper found that if elections were held now, Netanyahu’s Likud party would be reduced to 16 of the 120 seats in the national assembly, the Knesset.
The US, Israel’s closest ally, has provided strong military and political support for the campaign, but has been increasingly calling on Israel to scale back its assault and accept the establishment of a Palestinian state after the war, a suggestion Netanyahu has soundly rejected.
Speaking during a nationally televised news conference Thursday, Netanyahu said that a Palestinian state would become a launchpad for attacks on Israel – an argument that is popular in Israel.
Israel “must have security control over the entire territory west of the Jordan River”, Netanyahu said, adding: “That collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can we do?”
The US has said the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, which governs semi-autonomous zones in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, should be “revitalised”  and return to Gaza. Hamas ousted the authority from Gaza in 2007.
Netanyahu’s opponents accuse him of delaying any discussion of postwar scenarios in order to avoid looming investigations of governmental failures, keep his coalition intact and put off elections.
When asked if Netanyahu might be prolonging the war for political gain, Eisenkot paused before answering: “I hope not.”

Highlight: Gaza split into two parts, says Israel, as US sends missile-carrying submarine to Middle EastIsrael-Hamas war: latest updates
Body


The Israeli military says it has completely encircled Gaza City after over a week of heavy fighting, in effect severing the territory into two, as Israeli ground troops appeared poised to enter the dense urban sprawl from the south.
What seemed to be the beginning of the second stage of the Israeli ground operation was accompanied by a barrage of 16 rockets fired from southern Lebanon towards the Israeli city of Haifa on Monday afternoon.
The rocket fire, for which Hamas claimed responsibility, reached the furthest distance of any projectiles from the Lebanese side of the border fired by either the Palestinian militant group or Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese militia – a sign that escalation on Israel’s northern front is still an active threat even as fighting intensifies in Gaza.
Israel’s encirclement of Gaza City comes a month after Hamas conducted its murderous rampage across southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,400 Israelis and taking about 240 people hostage, the worst attack in the country’s history. Israel swiftly said it was at war with Hamas and the toll on civilians in Gaza has been horrifying.
The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, warned that the Gaza Strip was becoming “a graveyard for children” as he called again for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. 
“We must act now to find a way out of this brutal, awful, agonising dead end of destruction,” Guterres told reporters at the UN. “Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children. Hundreds of girls and boys are reportedly being killed or injured every day.” 
The Hamas-run local health authority said more than 10,000 Palestinians had been killed by airstrikes and artillery fire. The territory’s 2.3 million civilians have no safe place to go, but with food, water, fuel and medical supplies dwindling, international calls for a humanitarian pause or ceasefire have been firmly rejected by Israel, which has vowed to crush the militants’ operational capabilities. 
Moving under the cover of intensive aerial bombardments on Sunday night from air, land and sea – accompanied by a communications blackout – Israeli troops moved to surround Gaza City as Hamas militants were reported to have pulled back to prepared positions deeper in the densely packed territory. 
Sunday’s airstrikes were the most ferocious on the territory since the war broke out. It was not immediately clear what had been hit in the centre of Gaza City, as huge plumes of fire and smoke rose into the night air.
“Today there is north Gaza and south Gaza,” R Adm Daniel Hagari said, calling it a “significant stage” in Israel’s war against the Hamas militant group ruling the territory. Israeli media reported that troops were expected to enter Gaza City in force within the next 48 hours.
The fate of the hostages – of whom the only signs of life came in a video released by Hamas showing three women – also complicates the offensive. On Tuesday, a month since their abduction, the families are expected to protest at the Western Wall plaza in Jerusalem, the holiest site in Judaism, as well as at the Knesset, over what they say are inadequate efforts to reach a deal with Hamas to release their loved ones. 
The latest moves on the ground in the Gaza Strip were accompanied by mounting speculation over the kind of fighting that would unfold in Gaza City’s streets, amid suggestions that the Israel Defence Forces would try to avoid costly warfare within Hamas’s tunnel system.
In a briefing with reporters on Monday, the IDF spokesperson, Lt Col Richard Hecht, said the army was striving to maintain humanitarian corridors so that people could flee to the south of the territory, but acknowledged that if Hamas was believed to be using the roads, the IDF would not hesitate to attack there.
He also echoed comments by senior IDF commanders that Hamas was using medical infrastructure, including Gaza City’s Dar al-Shifa, Indonesian and Qatari hospitals, to hide underground and launch rocket salvoes.
In response to a question about whether Israel was now treating the hospitals as military targets, Hecht said: “This is one of our biggest challenges. We haven’t struck any hospitals yet. When it comes, we will discuss it.”
The New York Times quoted officials as saying the White House had sent messages to Iran and Hezbollah that the US would be prepared to intervene militarily if they joined Hamas in attacking Israel. On Sunday, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, reiterated the US position that it was committed to deterring “any state or non-state actor seeking to escalate this conflict”. An Ohio-class guided missile-carrying submarine has been sent to the region.
In a phone call on Monday with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the US president, Joe Biden, repeated a request to protect Palestinians, but there were few signs that the calls for restraint were being heard.
Asked about civilian casualties on Monday, a White House spokesperson said: “We have seen some indications that there are efforts being applied in certain scenarios to try to minimise, but I don’t want to overstate that.”
In another sign of widening unrest, a Palestinian man stabbed and wounded two members of Israel’s paramilitary border police in East Jerusalem before being shot dead, according to police.
Tensions remain high with Lebanon, where on Sunday an Israeli strike on a car in the south of the country killed three children and their grandmother, Lebanese authorities said. Israel’s chief military spokesperson said the military had attacked “terrorist targets of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon” in response to a missile attack against tanks that killed an Israeli citizen.
About 1.5 million Palestinians, or approximately 70% of Gaza’s population, are estimated to have fled their homes since the war began, following Israeli orders to evacuate to “safe zones” in the southern half of the strip, which have still been bombed. UN officials say civilians are surviving on two pieces of bread a day, made from flour from their stores, and access to clean water is a constant problem. Another 75 aid trucks made it into Gaza via Egypt on Sunday, bringing the total to 525 since 21 October, although aid agencies say the supplies are a fraction of what is needed to stave off humanitarian disaster. On Monday, evacuations of foreigners, dual nationals and wounded Palestinians resumed, the Hamas government said. 
The IDF said that water and humanitarian goods were available in the south of Gaza, but that Hamas was impeding convoys by firing on them.
Hazem al-Enezi, the director of an orphanage in Gaza City housing 27 children, said he and the institute’s sole remaining staff member had managed to evacuate the children to an apartment belonging to a friend in the south of Gaza City on Friday after ground fighting drew too close to the building.
They moved the children in civilian cars with the help of neighbours, beset by artillery fire. One of the vehicles was running on cooking fuel rather than petrol as dwindling fuel supplies were directed to keeping hospital generators functioning.
“I prayed to God we would make it,” he said. “We have moved, but we don’t have that many supplies for the young children.”
Amid mounting diplomatic efforts by the US to secure a humanitarian pause in the fighting, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, met the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan for talks in Ankara. 
The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, travelled across Turkey’s remote north-east on Monday in an apparent snub of Washington’s top diplomat.
The US diplomat has been facing a chorus of Arab calls to support an immediate ceasefire. Foreign ministers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates met Blinken in Amman on Saturday and also urged him to persuade Israel to agree to a ceasefire. Blinken visited Iraq on Sunday and held talks with the prime minister, Mohammed al-Sudani.
Jordan’s military airdropped urgent medical aid to a Jordanian field hospital in Gaza early on Monday, according to a social post from Jordan’s king and reports in state media.

Highlight: The Party of God has a well-armed military wing, decisive political power and hundreds of millions of dollars
Body


                   The Party of God                   
Hezbollah , or the Party of God, is one of the most important Islamist movements in the Middle East. Based in Lebanon , it has a powerful military wing, which is the focus of current concern, but it also runs a political party that wields decisive influence, TV stations and an extensive network of welfare services including clinics and schools. Its sprawling business interests, both licit and illicit, bring in hundreds of millions of dollars.
This wide range of resources and its close links with Iran and Syria have helped the Hezbollah overcome multiple challenges in its 40-year existence. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps played a key role at the organisation’s very beginnings and have effectively mentored what Tehran sees as a key proxy ever since. Hezbollah is a regional player, and its specialists are reported to have been deployed to Iraq to train Shia militias  and Yemen to work with Houthi rebels. 
                   A history of violence                   
Since its foundation by a group of radical Shia clerics in 1982, Hezbollah has been blamed for major and bloody acts of violence in Lebanon, against Israel and internationally too. Terrorism experts see it as a pioneer of mass casualty suicide attacks.
Designated as a terrorist organisation by the US, Israel and some other countries, Hezbollah controls much of Lebanon’s majority Shia areas: southern Beirut, southern Lebanon, and the eastern Bekaa Valley. 
Relations between Hezbollah and the Palestinian faction Hamas are not always good. Hamas is an offshoot of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood movement, while Hezbollah’s ideological wellspring is the Iranian revolution.
The two groups fell out over Syria during the civil war, when Hamas refused to back the government of Bashar al-Assad.  But representatives of both – and Iranian security officials – consult regularly. All are dedicated to the destruction of Israel and oppose any normalisation of ties by Arab or Muslim states.
Though there is no evidence of direct involvement, experts see the influence of Hezbollah in the Hamas atrocities in Israel 10 days ago.
“There is no doubt that Hamas had Hezbollah input. This was straight out of the Hezbollah playbook,” said Matthew Levitt, at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
                   The threat now                   
A recent video showing fighters training with sniper rifles, skis and skidoos in the mountains of Lebanon may have exaggerated some of Hezbollah’s military capabilities but few analysts doubt that these are significant.
Hezbollah has a force of 20,000 fighters, many highly trained and well armed, which could be rapidly expanded by calling up 30,000 part-timers, then augmented further with less well trained auxiliaries, said Naveed Ahmed, an independent Gulf-based analyst specialising in Hezbollah.
Many Hezbollah commanders gained useful experience in battles in Syria , where the organisation deployed en masse to reinforce Assad’s regime, and experts say Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon is now defended by a system of deep bunkers, tunnels and underground storage depots.
Crucially, Hezbollah has vast stocks of long-range missiles, which could strike almost anywhere in Israel and overwhelm defensive shields to destroy essential infrastructure as well as hit population centres. Recent Israeli airstrikes in Syria are likely to have been aimed at interdicting further supplies reaching Hezbollah from Iran.
“They are arming to the teeth. They have stockpiled missiles, lots of artillery shells … they have long-range drones capable of carrying full payloads. It’s a very skilful and advanced military organisation after its experience in Syria,” said Ahmed.
                   War between Israel and Hezbollah                   
Tensions along Israel’s frontier with Lebanon are very high. There have been days of clashes and some fatalities. On Tuesday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon landed in the town of Metula in northern Israel. Israel Defence Forces have replied with artillery and airstrikes. Dozens of villages south of the border have been evacuated. 
If Hezbollah’s leaders (or more likely Tehran) decide in favour of escalating current low-level hostilities this could lead to a bloody and difficult two-front conflict for Israel and so – potentially – to a regional conflagration as Syria, Iran, the US and other actors become involved.
Some analysts believe that Hezbollah, though dedicated to the destruction of Israel, has too much to lose to risk an all-out conflict, given its political and extensive commercial interests. Many suggest Hezbollah has for some time been looking to provoke a short, limited war  but wants to avoid anything bigger. All agree there is a considerable risk of a fatal miscalculation in such a tense environment, however.
One additional factor is the massive US force now steaming into the eastern Mediterranean, dispatched with the explicit intention of intimidating Hezbollah and its patrons in Tehran.
“No one – not even a sovereign nation – is going to ignore two aircraft carrier groups. It doesn’t stop them doing small – scale attacks but it will make [Hezbollah] think very carefully about doing anything bigger,” said Levitt.
What happens when the anticipated Israeli ground offensive into Gaza is launched is another question. A spokesperson for Hezbollah described its attacks so far “a warning”  to Israel, while senior Hezbollah officials have repeatedly said they would not stand by. Iran’s foreign minister has already warned that “the probable spread of war in other fronts is approaching unavoidable stage”.
The dramatically changed circumstances after the 7 October attacks mean conventional wisdom on how organisations such as Hamas or Hezbollah behave no longer holds true. This makes the future very difficult to predict – and so that much more dangerous.

Highlight: Significant incursion comes as EU leaders finalise text calling for ‘humanitarian corridors and pauses’ Israel and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Israeli forces entered a new phase of their war against Hamas in Gaza on Thursday, launching a substantial but limited raid into the coastal strip, in what was described as a probing action in preparation for a more sustained ground offensive.
Infantry backed by tanks and armoured bulldozers moved in under cover of night and attacked Hamas targets in an hours-long raid into the north of the territory, as officials raised the number of hostages confirmed to be held by the militant Islamist group to 224.
The Israeli raid, which moved about a kilometre into Gaza from the border fence, came as EU leaders prepared to call for “humanitarian corridors and pauses”  to shelling to get urgently needed aid into the territory, according to the final draft of a text to be approved at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.
More than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and there are fears the toll could rise further if Israel pushes ahead with the ground invasion. The UN said on Thursday that “nowhere is safe” in Gaza.
Hamas’s armed wing said on Thursday that “almost 50” Israeli hostages held in the Gaza Strip since the attacks on 7 October have been killed in Israeli bombing raids on the Palestinian territory.
The Israeli military said Thursday’s operation, which came as heavy strikes continued, was designed to search for tunnel systems and test Hamas’s responses, not least from teams Israel believes are equipped with Kornet anti-tank guided missiles, a source of major concern for Israeli military planners.
According to a military spokesperson, at least one Israeli tank came under anti-tank fire during the operation, but Israeli forces later left without incurring casualties.
Grainy video footage released by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) showed a column of at least a dozen main battle tanks and other armoured vehicles crossing through an opening in the Gaza border wall and firing on a nearby built-up area of damaged buildings.
Although Israeli troops have been raiding frequently into Gaza in the recent fighting, this incursion was described as far more significant in scale and aimed at shaping the conditions for fighting in immediate border areas for the “next stages of the war”.
The troops, who according to Israeli media reports came from the Givati brigade and 162nd Armoured Division, returned from the raid without casualties.
“Through the raid, we eliminated terrorists, neutralised threats, dismantled explosives, neutralised ambushes, in order to enable the next stages of the war for the ground forces,” said the Israeli military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza since 7 October when Hamas gunmen poured across the border, killing 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapping others.
It emerged on Wednesday that among the dead in Gaza were the wife and two children of Al Jazeera’s chief correspondent in the territory, Wael Dahdouh, who was helping to broadcast live images of its night sky when he received the news that his family members had been killed in what Al Jazeera said was an Israeli airstrike.
Moments later, the Qatari-based satellite channel switched to footage of Dahdouh entering al-Aqsa hospital in Gaza and giving way to grief as he looked at his dead son.
“They take revenge on us in our children,” he said, kneeling over his son’s body, still wearing his protective press vest from his day’s work.
The Israeli military claims it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in densely populated Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired rocket barrages into Israel since the war began.
With tens of thousands of troops massed at the Gaza border, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said the country was “raining down hellfire” and that a substantive ground offensive was being prepared.
“I cannot say when, how or how many, nor all the elements that we are taking into account, of which most are not known to the public,” he said.
Amid mounting international concern over the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, the European Council was expected to add its voice to those calling for a humanitarian pause in the fighting to allow aid access to 1.4 million Palestinians who have been displaced by the fighting.
The draft text of an official EU declaration says: “The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs.
“The European Union will work closely with partners in the region to protect civilians, provide assistance and facilitate access to food, water, medical care, fuel and shelter, ensuring that such assistance is not abused by terrorist organisations.”
Israel’s raid took place as it carried out strikes on about 250 locations overnight, including one by the Israeli navy on what it said was a ground-to-air missile launchers near Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.
The fighting in Gaza was continuing amid reports in Israeli media of talks intended to secure a substantial release of hostages in the coming days.
Quoting unnamed Israeli and foreign sources, the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper said advanced talks were under way to release a significant number of hostages and that the move could be made “within a few days”.
Separately Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, suggested that Hamas was ready to release civilian hostages to Tehran, according to comments reported by Reuters, although it was unclear how that would work.
Later on Thursday, Hamas claimed that as many as 50 of the hostages had already been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza. Asked about the claim, an Israeli spokesperson declined to comment.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization called for Hamas to provide proof of life of the hostages it was holding and to release them all on health grounds.
“Many of the hostages, including children, women and the elderly, have pre-existing health conditions requiring urgent and sustained care and treatment. The mental health trauma that the abducted, and the families, are facing is acute and psychosocial support is of great importance,” said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
Despite the growing international alarm at the civilian impact inside Gaza, senior Israeli figures and Hamas – which is listed as a proscribed terrorist group in a number of countries, including the UK – raised the prospect of an intensification of the conflict, with Saleh al-Arouri, the Lebanon-based deputy head of the Hamas political bureau, saying that “the [real] battles have not yet begun”.
On the Israeli side, Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet and a former IDF chief of staff, told Israeli radio on Thursday: “The war will soon enter new stages and [will be fought] with greater intensity.”
US media reported that Joe Biden had been pushing Netanyahu to hold off on a ground invasion while Hamas still held hostages, but on Wednesday he denied such reports.
“What I have indicated to him is that if that’s possible to get these folks out safely, that’s what he should do. It’s their decision … but I did not demand it,” Biden said.
The raid came after the UN said it was on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip, forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory, which has been under a complete siege since Hamas’s rampage across southern Israel  ignited the war earlier this month.
                     Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report

Highlight: Call for ceasefire by agency leaders of UN, which said airstrikes on Gaza had caused the most deaths of its aid workers in one conflict
Body


The deaths of scores of aid workers in airstrikes on Gaza over the past month has made the conflict the deadliest ever for UN workers.
At least 88 people  who worked for the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, have been killed since 7 October. Forty-seven of its buildings have been damaged.
Separately, at least 150 health workers have been killed in Gaza – 16 while on duty – and 18 emergency-service workers for Gaza’s civil defence, according to the UN.  More than 100 health facilities have been damaged.
UN agency leaders called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access to the territory. They called for both Israel and Hamas to respect international law.
In a joint statement, signatories including the UN human rights commissioner, Volker Turk; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization; and the UN aid chief, Martin Griffiths, said: “It’s been 30 days. Enough is enough. This must stop now.
“Civilians and the infrastructure they rely on – including hospitals, shelters and schools – must be protected. More aid – food, water, medicine and of course fuel – must enter Gaza safely, swiftly and at the scale needed, and must reach people in need, especially women and children, wherever they are,” they said.
UNRWA held a memorial service last week in the Jordanian capital, Amman, for colleagues killed in the conflict.. The agency’s chief, Philippe Lazzarini, described those who had died as “extraordinary people who dedicated their lives to their communities”.
He said: “Thousands of our colleagues, despite the fact that they share the same loss, fear and daily struggle of millions of Gazans, put on their UN vest and go to work. They are our true heroes. They are the face of humanity during its darkest hours. I am deeply grateful to them and to you all.
“We will not give up our constant efforts to advocate for the protection of civilians and all UNRWA installations, and the uninterrupted flow of meaningful humanitarian aid to civilians, wherever they are in Gaza.”
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said four of its medics had been killed and 21 people injured on duty, while eight emergency vehicles had been put out of service by damage caused by Israeli airstrikes.
It said a medic was injured when a convoy of ambulances was hit by what the society said were two Israeli airstrikes, the second outside the gates of Gaza City’s Dar al-Shifa hospital. The convoy was supposed to transport casualties to the Rafah crossing with Egypt for treatment but had to turn back because of damage to the roads.
“At all levels, we are dealing with a health disaster, from type of injuries to number of injuries. We already lost 150 medical personnel, as Israel killed them in airstrikes,” said Marwan Abu Saada, a senior surgeon at Dar al-Shifa hospital. “The situation is disastrous. We have zero capacity.”
The Catholic charity Caritas reported the death of a 26-year-old worker, Viola, with her husband and infant daughter, when an airstrike hit St Porphyrios Orthodox church , which had been sheltering about 500 people, including five Caritas staff and their families.
Aseel Baidoun, advocacy manager for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, said non-stop bombing had forced many UN services to halt their work, with staff moved to the south of Gaza. Other workers were taking risks to continue providing support, she said.
“They want to do more but they can’t. It’s an endless loop of frustration – of being so scared, not being able to help. Every doctor I talk to says we are living in a catastrophe, we can no longer function, we can no longer deal with the influx of injuries.”

Highlight: Security officials keen to arrange meeting as ‘time running out’, according to reportsIsrael-Gaza war – live updates
Body


The Israeli military expanded its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip to the densely populated urban refugee camps  in the central part of the territory as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was reported to have refused requests from security officials to make plans for control of Gaza after the war with Hamas ends.
Over the last few days, three requests to the prime minister’s office were conveyed on behalf of the directors of the Mossad, the Shin Bet, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff and the defence ministry to arrange a meeting on decisions relating to “the day after” Israel declares it has achieved its goals against the Palestinian militant group in control of the Gaza Strip, Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Tuesday night.
All those requests were refused, the network said. “Time is running out and decisions need to be made already about how to act with regard to all the relevant actors inside and outside the Gaza Strip. The Americans want explanations,” it quoted an unnamed security official as saying.
Tuesday’s report comes amid allegations in the Israeli media that Netanyahu and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant, have also refused to discuss the long-expected transition from the current “high intensity” stage of fighting to a new phrase focused on the more precise targeting of Hamas’s leaders, as well as a report that Netanyahu did not allow Gallant to hold detailed discussions with the Mossad about a possible hostage release deal.
Netanyahu may wish to postpone such discussions to protect his position as prime minister: his wartime unity government will disband after the conflict ends, and any solution for Gaza that involves Palestinian actors, such as the return of the West Bank’s Palestinian Authority, threatens the stability of his far-right coalition government.
A spokesperson for the prime minister’s office said a date for a cabinet discussion on “the day after” had been set a month ago and would take place in the coming days.
In his first interview since the hostilities broke out, the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said on Tuesday night that the war was “beyond a catastrophe”, accusing Netanyahu of planning “to get rid of the Palestinians”.
On the ground in Gaza, Israel has broadened its offensive against Hamas, expanding into several overcrowded refugee camps near the central town of Deir al-Balah, as well as launching heavy airstrikes on the southern towns of Khan Younis and Rafah – all areas the military had told Palestinians to seek shelter earlier in the war.
On Wednesday, thousands of Palestinian families who fled Bureij camp, heavily targeted overnight, set up tents in the streets of Deir al-Balah.
“It was a night of hell. We haven’t seen such bombing since the start of the war,” said Rami Abu Mosab, speaking from Bureij, where he has been sheltering since fleeing his home in northern Gaza.
He said warplanes flew overhead, and gunfire and explosions echoed from the eastern edge of the camp. A home near his shelter was hit, but no one was able to reach the area, he said. The health authority in the Hamas-run strip said that more than 200 people had been killed in the last 24 hours.
House-to-house fighting has also been reported in the north of Gaza, despite comments from the IDF chief of staff over the weekend that the military had largely achieved operational control above the Gaza River.
Since Christmas Eve, the besieged Palestinian territory has suffered some of the deadliest days of the 12-week-old conflict to date, sparked by Hamas’s devastating attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which militants killed 1,140 people and took up to 250 hostage.
Israel’s retaliatory war on the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has already become one of the most destructive conflicts of the 21st century, with estimates suggesting more than 20,900 people have been killed, 55,000 injured, and 85% of the Palestinian territory’s 2.3 million people forced to flee their homes.
Despite rising international outcry over the humanitarian disaster, including growing criticism from the US, Israel’s most important ally, Netanyahu has said that Israel will push on until “complete victory” over Hamas.
Ron Dermer, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, is expected to meet with US officials in Washington on Wednesday. Divisions within the Biden administration over Israel policy have been growing, with some officials saying the US has underestimated the scale of disillusionment in the global south over perceived hypocrisy in calling out Russian war crimes in Ukraine, but finding a multitude of reasons to justify the large-scale killings of Palestinians in Gaza.
Also on Wednesday, the UN appointed Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands’ outgoing finance minister, as aid coordinator to the Palestinian territory, following last week’s watered-down security council resolution, which called for aid to be delivered to Gaza “at scale”.
About 200 trucks a day are currently entering Gaza, but aid agencies say this is a fraction of what is needed. Before the latest conflict broke out, about 500 goods and aid trucks entered the territory every day.
The war in Gaza is also showing new signs of dangerous regional escalation, even as ceasefire talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar appear to have stalled.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed at least six Palestinians during an overnight raid in the refugee neighbourhood of Nur Shams, according to the Palestinian health ministry, bringing the total number of casualties in the territory to 300.
Israel and the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah have traded near-daily volleys of missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the frontier since 7 October: an Israeli strike on a house overnight killed a Hezbollah fighter and two relatives, local officials and state media said.
Behind the scenes, the US is leading intense negotiations to try to de-escalate the hostilities on the Blue Line that separates the two countries, where the risk of miscalculation setting off a regional war drawing in Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen is highest.

Body


An attack like Hamas’s 7 October massacre was not supposed to have been possible. Certainly not while prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in charge. He was, as his acolytes put it, “Mr Security”. He wanted to be remembered, he said, as “the protector of Israel”. He boasted that Israel had never known a more peaceful and prosperous time than the roughly 16 years he has been in power. It was under his successive administrations that Israel installed the Iron Dome system to intercept rockets from the Gaza Strip, and constructed, along the Gaza border, a 40-mile, $1.1bn fence, equipped with underground sensors, remote-controlled weapons and an expansive camera system. The success of Netanyahu’s vision of Fortress Israel could be measured in the imperceptibility of the Palestinians and their suffering from the comfort of a Tel Aviv cafe.
But the relative calm of the last decade-and-a-half was built upon a series of illusions: that the Palestinians and their aspirations for freedom could be hidden behind concrete barriers and ignored; that any remaining resistance could be managed through a combination of technology and overwhelming firepower; that the world, and especially Sunni Arab states, had grown so tired of the Palestinian issue that it could be removed from the global agenda, and consequently, that Israeli governments could do as they pleased and suffer few consequences.
The attack on 7 October shattered all these presumptions. Hamas gunmen on motorbikes and the backs of pickup trucks sailed through the “smart” barrier that cost more than the entire GDP of Grenada. Caught off guard, Israel’s army appeared almost immobilised, unable to regain control of some towns  and kibbutzim for more than 48 hours. Every aspect of Netanyahu’s project collapsed on the Saturday morning Israelis have taken to calling “the black shabbat”.
Successive Netanyahu governments did not make Israelis safer. Instead, they made them vulnerable to attacks such as the one Hamas carried out. Netanyahu did not chart a path for Israel out of its dependence on the United States. Instead, he left Israel as dependent on its US backer as it was during the only comparable disaster in Israel’s history, the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Netanyahu promised to streamline the state and make government more efficient. Instead, Israel’s bureaucracy has been hollowed out, its social services underfunded and unresponsive.
And yet, while Netanyahu’s vision for Israel has been utterly discredited, there is no clear successor poised to break with it. The iron tracks that Netanyahu laid may prove too hard to shift. The current crisis may very well mark the end of Netanyahu’s public career. But Israel may also be trapped in conditions of his making long after he is gone.
                   * * *                   
On a dark October night in 1995, Netanyahu stood  on a balcony overlooking Jerusalem’s Zion Square. A banner reading “Death to Arabs” had been unfurled before him. An inflamed crowd of tens of thousands stood below him. Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister at the time, was pushing for a negotiated settlement with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and this was a protest organised by the Oslo Accords’ rightwing opponents. At the time, Netanyahu was the 46-year-old elected leader of Israel’s rightwing Likud party. He was widely seen as a brash new face in a tired political scene still dominated by veterans of Israel’s founding.
A savvy political operator, Netanyahu had staked his political future on opposing the Oslo peace process. That summer, he had joined a demonstration that featured a mock funeral procession for Rabin, replete with a coffin and a noose, where protesters chanted “Death to Rabin”. In the streets of Jerusalem that October night, demonstrators brandished signs denouncing Rabin as a traitor. They held aloft pictures of him in the uniform of the Nazi SS, and in PLO chair Yasser Arafat’s keffiyeh. They chanted “in blood and fire we will expel Rabin”, and, again, “Death to Rabin”.
One month later, a religious nationalist law student named Yigal Amir fired two shots into Rabin’s back, killing him and the vision of territorial compromise he represented. Outside the hospital where Rabin’s death was announced, a crowd of the prime minister’s supporters chanted “Bibi is a murderer”. It was, of course, Amir who pulled the trigger. But Netanyahu was among the most prominent figures who had fuelled the atmosphere of violence in which Amir did the deed.
In 1996, the Labor party leader and Rabin’s successor, Shimon Peres, called elections in the hope of reaffirming a popular mandate for the Oslo peace process. According to the polls, it was a safe bet. Netanyahu’s popularity had begun to flag in the aftermath of Rabin’s assassination. But after a string of suicide bombings in the months before the May elections, Netanyahu’s fortunes began to improve. He hammered Peres on the perils of territorial compromise, framed his dovish opponent as weak and warned that Peres “would divide Jerusalem”. By a threadbare margin – less than 1% of the vote – Netanyahu staged a surprise upset. He became the youngest prime minister in Israel’s history.
Netanyahu’s first three-year term was not a success, but many of the hallmarks of his approach were already evident. Pressed by the Clinton administration to advance peace negotiations, Netanyahu strung the Americans along, committing only to the bare minimum required to keep the peace process alive, while doing everything possible to prevent a final status agreement in the long run. In the eyes of his rightwing critics, Netanyahu did not break decisively enough with the two-state solution. As Netanyahu saw it, however, the best way to prevent a Palestinian state was to do so quietly, without the fanfare that formal annexation or direct rejection of the US-led peace process would have entailed.
Netanyahu is not a conventional ideologue. His opposition to a two-state solution does not derive from any messianic conviction or biblical inspiration. While many of his supporters are religious traditionalists, he is staunchly secular and doesn’t even keep kosher.  Instead, his worldview is shaped by deep pessimism. “I’m asked if we will for ever live by the sword – yes,” he told a group of Knesset members in 2015. He had absorbed this view as a child. His father, Benzion Netanyahu, was a dyspeptic historian of the Spanish Inquisition who died in 2012, at the age of 102. “ Jewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts ,” Netanyahu Sr  once told the New Yorker’s David Remnick. For Netanyahu the son, that catastrophic vision of history has meant that nearly all matters of defence appear refracted through the lens of existential threat. According to such calculus, any Palestinian state would almost certainly devolve into an Islamist terror state threatening Israel’s existence; therefore indefinite Israeli control over the occupied territories is an absolute necessity for Jewish survival.
Netanyahu combined this bleak worldview with a mastery of the art of political presentation. He was Israel’s first real TV prime minister. He took acting classes to perfect his public performances. He wore makeup and made sure the cameras only showed his good side. At a time when most other Israeli politicians still favoured rolled-up shirt sleeves, Netanyahu appeared in bold Brioni suits, and this taste for luxury, too, would remain throughout his years in power.
A former special forces commando turned management consultant, Netanyahu embodied the new Israeli synthesis of hawkish neoliberalism. He was, at once, a technocrat and a populist. In 1996, he arrived in office with elaborate plans to remake the Israeli economy along Thatcherite free-market lines: restructuring of the country’s bureaucracy, liberalising the labour market; cutting subsidies for struggling industries. He accomplished little of this programme. More significant were the changes he brought to the country’s political culture. Ever since Menachem Begin’s premiership in the 1970s, Likud had used the rhetoric of class resentment and religious traditionalism to mobilise its base of largely working-class Mizrahim, Jews of Middle Eastern and north African origin. Netanyahu sharpened Likud’s populism for the age of the soundbite. His supporters rallied behind the slogan “Netanyahu – good for the Jews”, which implied that his opponents were disloyal to Jewish interests.
After he returned to power in 2009, Netanyahu vowed never to lose it. As Israeli journalist Ben Caspit details in his book, The Netanyahu Years, Netanyahu crushed or expelled any potential rivals within Likud. By 2015, he had “metamorphosed”, Haaretz editor Aluf Benn wrote, “from a risk-averse conservative into a rightwing radical”. He transformed a party that, while always staunchly and even violently nationalist, had once included economic and social liberals into an authoritarian populist party centred on his charismatic personality. Encouraged by his wife, Sara, and his son, Yair, Netanyahu also began to think of himself as indispensable, as the incarnation of the national spirit, as identical to the state itself. “Without Bibi,” Sara Netanyahu has repeatedly said, “Israel is doomed.”
                   * * *                   
Over his long years in power, a distinct “Netanyahu model” of politics emerged. When it came to the issue of the Palestinians, Netanyahu’s core belief was that the occupation could be managed and maintained indefinitely. In theory, Netanyahu suggested that he would be willing to accept the “demilitarised” Palestinian state that he described in a 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University.  Yet in practice, as he outlined in the same speech, the conditions under which he would agree to such a state were ones that no Palestinian leader could ever accept: not just demilitarisation and Israeli security control over airspace, but also an Israeli capital in an undivided Jerusalem. It was a bluff to keep the illusion of a peace process alive while further entrenching the occupation.
Netanyahu’s belief that the occupation could remain in perpetuity was, and is, widely shared. The Israeli centre-right’s leading intellectual, the philosopher Micah Goodman, gave the idea of occupation-management a respectable patina of pragmatism in his 2018 book Catch-67.  Rather than hoping to “solve” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Goodman suggested that it might be “minimised” – for instance, by expanding areas of limited Palestinian autonomy while maintaining ultimate Israeli dominance in the occupied West Bank.
Even Netanyahu’s political opponents have embraced this approach. The short-lived “change” government led by the former TV host Yair Lapid and settler leader Naftali Bennett, which briefly deposed Netanyahu in the spring of 2021, did not deviate from the Netanyahu model, but deepened it further. It was under the Lapid-Bennett government when Palestinian casualties in the West Bank began to spike. This was also the period when Benny Gantz, at the time minister of defence, designated six leading Palestinian human rights NGOs “terrorist organisations” as part of Israel’s efforts to quash opposition to the occupation.
To its proponents, the occupation-management paradigm had numerous practical advantages. Maintaining the status quo lowered the risk of enraging the international community. Indefinite yet putatively temporary occupation also enabled Israel to keep the Palestinians disenfranchised, whereas formal annexation would require Israel to decide whether to grant Palestinians in the annexed territories citizenship and, from Israel’s point of view, risk jeopardising the Jewish demographic majority.
Yet for Netanyahu and his allies, it was not enough simply to entrench the occupation; it was also necessary to guarantee that no unified Palestinian movement might arise. The way to do that, according to Netanyahu, was to strengthen the Islamist Hamas in Gaza at the expense of its rival, the Fatah-dominated PLO in the West Bank. To prop up the Hamas government in Gaza, at Israel’s request, the Qatari government transferred billions of dollars to the militant group. “Anyone who wants to prevent the creation of a Palestinian state needs to support strengthening Hamas,” said Netanyahu  at a Likud party meeting in 2019. “This is part of our strategy, to divide the Palestinians between those in Gaza and those in Judea and Samaria.”
What Israelis call “the conceptzia” – this paradigm of occupation-management and divide-and-rule – had its counterpart in the realm of foreign policy. Until 2020, the only Arab states to sign treaties with Israel were Egypt and Jordan. That changed when the Trump administration underwrote the 2020 Abraham Accords , the series of normalisation agreements between Israel and the Gulf States of Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as Morocco and, later, Sudan.  It is not a coincidence that Hamas launched its attack just as Israel and Saudi Arabia appeared to be getting closer to normalising relations. Even after the current devastating war, Israel and the Saudis may very well press on with this process, but it remains as clear as ever that long-term regional stability – and Israeli security – will depend on ending the occupation and realising Palestinian national aspirations.
From the perspective of Israel’s right, regional integration also provided an alternative safety net as the US turned its focus away from the Middle East and toward Asia. As one Israeli politician, a member of Avigdor Liberman’s rightwing secularist Yisrael Beitenu party told me in the summer of 2022, “the declining stature” of the US in world affairs necessitated closer ties between Israel and other countries in the region. “People understand that they need to hang on to each other,” he said.
A Middle East where the US played a less active role had also long been a dream of Israeli hawks, who view Israeli reliance on the US as a constraint and strategic liability. In 1996, a group of neoconservative thinktankers lead by Richard Perle, who would later join the George W Bush administration, published a paper titled A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm , which outlined steps for how Israel under Netanyahu could “forge a new basis for relations with the United States”. According to the authors, Israel could gain “greater freedom of action and remove a significant lever of pressure against it” if it was able to “cut itself free” from US support by “liberalising its economy”.
To a large extent, Netanyahu’s successive administrations followed this strategy. Aggressive privatisations of banks and utilities, tax cuts and sharp decreases on public spending, and anti-union measures did transform Israel from a middling, state-dominated economy into an affluent, military- and surveillance-tech exporting regional power, even as inequality within Israel deepened. Under Netanyahu – first as finance minister in Ariel Sharon’s government, then during his second stint as prime minister – Israel reversed  its longstanding trade deficit and began to accumulate vast foreign currency reserves. The stronger Israel became economically, the less it required direct economic grant aid from the US, which ceased in 2008.  Even US military aid to Israel, though it still amounts to the enormous sum of $38bn, mostly comes in the form of a discount  for Israeli purchases of US arms and missile-defence funding – essentially a subsidy to US arms manufactures.
In the 2010s, Netanyahu began to turn away from the US and its allies and cultivate relationships with proudly illiberal states such as Viktor Orbán’s Hungary and Poland under the rule of outgoing leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski as a means of blocking potential measures against Israel by the European Union. He boasted of his good working relationship with Russia’s Vladmir Putin – 2019 Likud election campaign posters showed Netanyahu shaking hands with Putin  –and throughout Russian’s war on Ukraine, Israel has refused to supply missile defence systems to Ukraine and has kept criticism of Russian conduct to a minimum. Ever wary of US decline, Israel has also developed closer ties with China. In 2021, as part of China’s belt and road initiative, Israel granted  the state-owned Shanghai International Port Group a tender to operate the Haifa Bay Port shipping terminal, which manages roughly half of the country’s freight. Chinese companies have also worked on major Israeli infrastructure projects, such as the new Tel Aviv light rail system.
In Israel’s domestic sphere, Netanyahu developed a distinct mode of personalistic rule. He granted ministerial and government agency positions to Likud apparatchiks and yes-men, unknowns and incompetents whose only credential seemed to be their loyalty to him. In 2020, after he was indicted in several corruption cases, charged with  bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu’s political style became increasingly paranoid. In a pre-trial speech , he declared: “Elements in the police and the prosecution have joined forces with the leftist media – I call them the ‘anyone but Bibi’ gang – to manufacture baseless cases against me.” This marked the crystallisation of what some Israeli commentators named “Bibism” – a synthesis of bellicose nationalism, conspiracy theorising and, above all else, the denunciation of Netanyahu’s opponents as traitors.
As more of the electorate turned against him, Netanyahu maintained a governing coalition by elevating extremist settlers and messianic ethno-nationalists to positions of power within his government. These included figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir , now minister of national security, who has previously been convicted of incitement to racism and terrorism, who as a young far-right militant had been part of a group that assaulted Yitzhak Rabin’s motorcade, and who, until recently, hung on his living room wall a picture of Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born Israeli settler who massacred 29 Palestinians at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron. As part of coalition negotiations last winter, Netanyahu transferred authority  over the military government in the West Bank to finance minister and hardline religious nationalist Bezalel Smotrich, who has called for the formal annexation of the West Bank and the expulsion of any Palestinians who resist.
Once invested with authority, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich began to push immediately for the annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank, implementing land-grab measures and approving unbridled settlement expansion, which culminated, even before the current war, in making 2023 the deadliest year for Palestinians since the second intifada. Between 1 January and 6 October , the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs recorded at least 199 Palestinian fatalities in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, the highest figure since 2005.
                   * * *                   
Hamas’s incursion on the morning of 7 October demolished each of the prongs of Netanyahu’s project. The scale and cruelty of the assault demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining the occupation for ever without continuous, devastating loss of life. For most of the past two decades, it was the Palestinians who bore the vast majority of this human cost, and those years lulled Israel into a dangerous complacency and indifference toward the fates of their Palestinian neighbours. The Hamas leadership recognised this vulnerability and exploited it to murderous effect.
While it will take time to grasp fully the extent of the Israeli intelligence failure, what has emerged so far is that military officials ignored what should have been warning signs. According to Haaretz, Israel intelligence stopped listening  to Hamas walkie-talkie chatter months before the attacks. On a recent TV interview, a 20-year-old soldier from the 7th armoured brigade said his unit had received reports of unusual activity at about 11pm the night of 6 October but were issued no follow-up command. At about 3am, Ronen Bar, director of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, received a call  in response to such reports. After hours of deliberation in the early morning, he sent only a small special forces team to the Gaza separation-fence area. Convinced that Hamas had been pacified, deterred and integrated into the Israeli apparatus of occupation-management, Israel’s generals did not take seriously that Hamas could carry out an attack of such magnitude.
The attacks also revealed with terrifying clarity the strategic risk posed by the ongoing settlement enterprise in the West Bank. One reason why Hamas gunmen managed to overwhelm Israeli defences, and why it took so long for Israeli forces to retake the towns and kibbutzim that had been overrun, was that much of Israel’s army had been sent to the West Bank. That weekend was the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah – under normal circumstances a time of joy and dancing, but in the occupied West Bank, a time of heightened settler violence. The Israeli army had even relocated forces away from the Gaza border to the West Bank, to guard Israeli settlers. In total, 32 IDF battalions had deployed to the occupied West Bank, while just two battalions deployed along the Gaza border. This left the kibbutzim and towns of the western Negev – the citizens of Israel proper – vulnerable, while West Bank settlers could terrorise the Palestinian population under IDF cover. Advocates of settlement-building have long claimed that their efforts bolstered Israel’s security. Reality has proven their argument wrong.
Netanyahu’s failures in the realm of foreign relations are no less stark. Contrary to his long-held view, the question of Palestine will not simply go away. No real Israeli integration into the broader Middle East will be possible without a long-term agreement that ends the occupation of the West Bank and the siege of the Gaza Strip. The current war has frayed Israel’s relations with Egypt and Jordan, its two most crucial Arab allies. With the help of the US, the Israeli government has attempted to pressure the Egyptian government into taking Gazans into Egyptian territory, a move that reflects a reckless disregard for the stability of their south-west neighbour. Egyptian authorities have so far refused. Massive protests have broken out not only in Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, but also in Turkey. The Abraham Accords, which Netanyahu took to be his epochal achievement, have also shown signs of strain. In early November, Bahrain recalled  its ambassador from Israel and announced that it had suspended economic ties to show support for the Palestinian cause.
Above all, the ostensible “self-reliance” that Netanyahu achieved has proved to be a farce. Amid the threat of a broader regional war, Israel now appears more dependent than ever on its US sponsor, which has moved two aircraft carrier strike groups to the Middle East to deter regional escalation of the conflict. The US provides Israel with everything from small arms, such as automatic rifles, to key components of the Iron Dome system. It even sent  three-star general James Glynn of the US Marines to advise the Israeli general staff on how to conduct urban counterinsurgency. In an unprecedented display of US involvement, secretary of state Antony Blinken and secretary of defense Lloyd Austin have both sat in on Israeli security cabinet planning meetings to counsel their Israeli counterparts.
Within Israel, the incompetent response to 7 October has exposed the toll Netanyahu’s long rule has taken on the state. For days, and in some cases weeks, after the attacks, some families reported that they had heard nothing from government officials about the whereabouts of their missing relatives; daytime TV anchors stepped in to create hotlines for those desperate for information. On the day of the attacks, when dozens of police were killed, Ben-Gvir, whose office oversees the police, was nowhere to be found; only later did he emerge, not to take responsibility for what had happened, but to stage photo-ops of himself distributing assault rifles to civilian defence units in Israeli cities. State efforts to relocate, feed and clothe the tens of thousands of Israelis evacuated from the northern and southern borders were so ineffectual that protest groups, which had formed during the demonstrations against the government’s judicial overhaul plan, stepped in to fill the void. Budget cuts to the ministry of health have created a shortage of state-funded social workers and psychologists to handle the thousands of people in need of treatment for trauma.
For his part, Netanyahu seems to be managing the crisis with his increasingly dim political future in mind. As ever, his concern is optics. He has not attended a single funeral for those killed on 7 October, presumably out of fear that attendees might accost him. He has favoured broadcast addresses and staged photo-ops with elite military units. When he finally met with representatives of the families of those taken hostage, a far-right activist with no known ties to any hostages, but with close ties to the Netanyahu family, just happened to suddenly appear  at the meeting to praise him. Having already attempted to blame military and intelligence officials for the 7 October disaster, Netanyahu is now busy collecting evidence  to exculpate himself when, after the war, he finally faces a reckoning.
                   * * *                   
Despite such efforts at image rehabilitation, Netanyahu is all but finished politically. The public’s anger towards him and his government is immense. In a recent survey conducted by Israel’s Channel 13 News, 76% of respondents  said Netanyahu needs to resign – either at the end of the war (47%) or immediately (29%). During a recent interview with the Israeli liberal daily Haaretz, the former defence minister Moshe Ya’alon, a man whose political views are to Netanyahu’s right, called the prime minister “an existential threat” to the country. Another poll found that less than 4% of Israelis believe Netanyahu is a reliable source of information about the current war.
What comes after Netanyahu? Before 7 October, his attempt to dismantle the country’s judiciary had sparked the largest protest movement  in Israel’s history. For more than nine months, hundreds of thousands took to the streets in an attempt to stave off a reactionary constitutional revolution that would have made it almost impossible for the right to lose power. These protests revitalised Israeli civil society, which had shrivelled over the course of Netanyahu’s tenure. The perceived threat of an Orbán- or Erdogan-style autocracy has re-politicised and, in some cases, even radicalised segments of Israel’s liberal, secular, educated middle classes. Any new political force that might not just challenge Netanyahu the man, but also break with his policies, will probably emerge out of this movement.
Still, what remains of Israel’s left finds itself in a difficult place. The last few years of repeated elections – there have been five since 2019 – devastated the Labor Zionist parties that once dominated Israeli political life. The Labor party itself has been reduced to just four parliamentary seats. Meretz, the civil libertarian, social-democratic party that long represented the country’s peace camp has no seats. Since 7 October, Yair Golan , a 61-year-old former IDF general and erstwhile Meretz chairman has become something of a national celebrity after he donned his uniform and rescued civilians under Hamas attack; for the time being, he is the Israeli centre-left’s last, best hope to bring a negotiated compromise with the Palestinians back to the Israeli mainstream – but it is an extremely remote possibility.
Israel’s public discourse has lurched much further to the right. TV news amplifies the calls for revenge and the use of disproportionate force, even as the death toll in Gaza rises into the tens of thousands. Each day, another Likud politician or government minister emerges to call unashamedly for war crimes. Agriculture minister Avi Dichter appeared  on television last week to urge on the “Gaza Nakba”, as he described Israel’s current ground operation. Deputy speaker of the Knesset, Nissim Vaturi, tweeted that Israel should  “Burn Gaza now, nothing less!” Earlier this month, the minister of heritage, Amihai Eliyahu suggested Israel could drop  drop a nuclear bomb on the Gaza Strip. Some Israeli pop stars have begun  to sing of conquering and rebuilding Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. Though the political leaders of the settler right, such as Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, have been discredited, the veteran pollster Dudi Hasid recently observed that there might be space even further to their right awaiting to be filled. Netanyahu and his government have said that the aim of the war is to topple Hamas; Israel’s almost inevitable failure to fully meet this goal could, in fact, generate an increased ethno-nationalist backlash.
The most likely possibility, however, is that the Netanyahu project persists in the absence of the man himself. The most probable successor to Netanyahu is his closest rival of several years, Benny Gantz, the former IDF chief and leader of the centre-right National Unity party, whose ratings  have skyrocketed in the past six weeks. The tall, blue-eyed Gantz presents an image of martial rectitude compared to Netanyahu’s mafioso-populism. Yet Gantz is less an ideological alternative to Netanyahu than a cosmetic one. A loyal soldier for his entire life, he has known nothing other than the occupation-management paradigm, and would probably maintain it. Polling just behind Gantz, former prime minister Naftali Bennett also appears poised for a bid at power. Bennett – who once served as Netanyahu’s chief of staff – would also probably stick to the Netanyahu playbook.
For years, Netanyahu has imagined himself  as the Middle East’s Winston Churchill. The Israeli journalist Ari Shavit has observed that Netanyahu sees himself not simply as battling threats to Israel’s existence, but as a frontline defender of the west against its mortal enemies. Since the start of the current war, Netanyahu’s grandiose illusions have been on display. “We are sons of light, they are sons of darkness,” he recently declared.  Yet it is, at least in part, this very pessimism – the worldview in which it is always 1933 – that has doomed Israel under Netanyahu to endless wars – seven since he assumed power in 2009 – and condemned the Palestinians in Gaza to repeated bombardment.
Any break with the Netanyahu paradigm will require moving beyond the mentality according to which Israel’s existence hangs ever in the balance – a task that, after the massacres of 7 October, will be much more difficult. But as Israeli security officials will freely acknowledge, this ghastly war, even with its threat of turning into multi-front conflagration, is not an existential war for Israel. If there is to be any hope of undoing the Netanyahu legacy, it will come from an Israeli leader, perhaps one whose name is not yet known, with the courage to acknowledge frankly Israel’s strength and use it as a basis for a renewed push for peace.
For now, however, there are no such candidates. Netanyahu has reshaped the country in his image; he has led the country for longer than David Ben-Gurion, the country’s founding father. Even after Netanyahu the man is gone, his legacy discredited, the mould he set will prove difficult to shatter.

Highlight: Health officials say blast killed hundreds as footage shows fire engulfing medical centre owned by Anglican churchIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in a massive explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City, in the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007.
The Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said at least 500 people were killed on Tuesday night in what it said was an Israeli airstrike on al-Ahli al-Arabi, also known as the Baptist hospital. A spokesperson for the Gaza civil defence put the number of killed at about 300.
The bloodshed at the hospital comes 11 days into a new war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group that continues to escalate before an expected visit to the region by Joe Biden, complicating US efforts to stop the conflict spiralling across the Middle East.
The Israeli military said an initial investigation suggested the explosion was caused by a failed Hamas rocket launch, before saying it was the result of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket barrage. Islamic Jihad denied the Israeli allegation, and the scale of the blast appeared to be outside either of the militant groups’ capabilities.
Footage broadcast from the ground by Al Jazeera showed a huge fire engulfing the multi-storey building, with bodies, including small children, and widespread debris scattered around.
The hospital, which is owned by the Anglican church, was reportedly struck without any prior warning. It was previously hit by a rocket on Saturday in an attack that injured four medical staff.
The strike occurred at about 7.30pm local time. The hospital was packed with people injured in previous Israeli strikes, as well as civilians seeking shelter, believing the hospital grounds to be safer than their homes after relentless Israeli attacks that have already killed more than 3,000 people.
“We were operating in the hospital, there was a strong explosion, and the ceiling fell on the operating room. This is a massacre,”? said Dr Ghassan Abu Sittah.
“Nothing justifies this shocking attack on a hospital and its many patients and health workers, as well as the people who sought shelter there. ?Hospitals are not a target. ? This bloodshed must stop. ?Enough is enough.”
More than 300 casualties were taken in ambulances and private cars to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, which was already overwhelmed with wounded. Injured people lay on bloody floors, screaming in pain.
Dr Ziad Shehadah told Al Jazeera: “What’s happened is terrible because those people, all of them, are civilians. They fled their homes and reached a place that they believed was safe – a hospital, which according to international law, is a safe place.
“People left their homes thinking they were more dangerous and they move to our schools and hospitals to be safe. And in one minute, all of them have been killed at a hospital.”
Aid agencies and governments around the world were quick to condemn the blast, claiming it was a war crime.
The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, demanded the immediate protection of civilians and healthcare in the Palestinian territory.
“WHO strongly condemns the attack on Al Ahli Arab hospital,” he tweeted. “Early reports indicate hundreds of deaths and injuries. We call for the immediate protection of civilians and healthcare.”
Canon Richard Sewell, the dean of the Anglican-run St George’s College in Jerusalem, said: “Disaster: our hospital, Ahli Arab hospital, has taken a direct hit from an Israeli missile. Early reports say hundreds of women and children killed.
“This attack is unprecedented in scale,” Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza, told Reuters. “We have seen consistent attacks on healthcare in the occupied Palestinian territory,” he said.
Hamas, which sparked the latest war with an attack last week that killed more than 1,400 Israelis, called Tuesday’s hospital strike “a horrific massacre”. It said in a statement that most of the casualties were displaced families, patients, children and women.
Before the al-Ahli blasts, Israeli strikes on Gaza had killed at least 2,778 people and wounded 9,700, according to the Gaza health ministry. Nearly two-thirds of those killed were children.
“There are corpses in the streets. Buildings are crashing down on their inhabitants,” Jamil Abdullah, a Palestinian Swede, who was hoping to flee the blockaded enclave, told AFP. “The smell of the dead is everywhere.”
The US president, Joe Biden, is due to arrive in Tel Aviv  on Wednesday for talks with Benjamin Netanyahu but will no longer meet Egyptian and Palestinian leaders for a summit in Jordan after it was cancelled in the wake of the hospital blast. The attack raises the stakes for the president’s visit, amid fears of a regional war that could drag in the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and its Iranian backers.
After the cancellation, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement: “What is taking place is genocide. We call on the international community to intervene immediately to stop this massacre. Silence is no longer acceptable.”
Abbas, however, is deeply unpopular with the Palestinian public, many of whom see him as little more as a subcontractor for Israeli security after 16 years in office without elections.
After news of the hospital attack spread, hundreds of people flooded the streets of major West Bank cities  including Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, where protesters hurled stones at Palestinian security forces who fired back with stun grenades. “The people want the fall of the president,” demonstrators chanted.

Have war crimes been committed in Israel and Gaza and what international laws apply?

Highlight: The UN has said there is evidence that international humanitarian law may have been breached by both sides in the conflictIsrael and Hamas at war – live updates
Body


The United Nations  has said “there is already clear evidence  that war crimes may have been committed” by Hamas and the Israeli military since 7 October and that it is gathering evidence for potential prosecutions.
                   Which laws apply to the Israel-Hamas war?                   
All parties involved in the conflict are governed by a body of law drawn from a system of conventions, treaties and war crimes tribunal rulings known as “ international humanitarian law  ” (IHL) or the “law of armed conflict”.
IHL has two key elements. The protection of non-combatants such as civilians or soldiers who have surrendered, and restrictions on the type of warfare employed by a belligerent.
The rules are rooted in treaties going back to the 19th century but these days IHL is built around the 1949 Geneva conventions signed after crimes against humanity committed in the second world war, with a new focus on the protection of civilians. Additional protocols have been added over the years covering the use of certain types of weapons.
There is also case law from various international tribunals, such as the international criminal tribunal that tried the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis in Rwanda, which was the first to rule that rape had been used as a weapon of war and genocide.
Israel has not ratified certain protocols in the conventions covering areas such as collective punishments, but the US and other countries regard these provisions as having entered customary international law and therefore binding on all states.
                   Is there evidence of war crimes in the fighting between Israel and Hamas?                   
The UN said that Hamas’s indiscriminate killing of hundreds of noncombatants, including children, and the abduction of about 200 others as hostages and human shields in Gaza, is a crime under international humanitarian law.
“Reports that armed groups from Gaza have gunned down hundreds of unarmed civilians are abhorrent and cannot be tolerated. Taking civilian hostages and using civilians as human shields are war crimes,” it said.
Legal experts said that Hamas and other groups such as Islamic Jihad may also be guilty of war crimes for firing thousands of rockets from Gaza into Israel.
The UN also said that Israel may be committing the war crime of collective punishment through its siege of the Gaza territory. The International Committee of the Red Cross agreed. 
“The instructions issued by the Israeli authorities for the population of Gaza City to immediately leave their homes, coupled with the complete siege, explicitly denying them food, water and electricity are not compatible with international humanitarian law,” it said.
Amnesty International said  it has “documented unlawful Israeli attacks, including indiscriminate attacks, which caused mass civilian casualties and must be investigated as war crimes”.
Human Rights Watch said  that “multiple war crimes have been and continue to be committed in Israel and Palestine, with grave concerns that Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups are carrying out unlawful indiscriminate attacks harming civilians”.
The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, said more than 8,000 people have been killed in the Israeli assault, including more than 3,000 children.
Some groups have gone further and accused Israel of genocide , although lawyers said that is a harder crime to prove under international law.
                   Who would prosecute?                   
The international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, the permanent court with jurisdiction over war crimes and other crimes against humanity such as genocide, steps in when local jurisdictions fail to prosecute.
The ICC recognised Palestine as a member in 2015.  The Palestinians then asked the court to investigate Israel’s assault on Gaza the previous year, and the continued construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The Palestinians have argued that the presence of about 750,000 settlers is in breach of a Geneva conventions requirement that “the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”.
Israeli legal and human rights groups also said that Israel is committing the “crime of apartheid” in the occupied territories in breach of international laws specifically barring the practice.
Israel has said it is not subject to the ICC’s authority because it did not sign the Rome statute that established the court and came into force in 2002. The US has backed this position, saying that it “ firmly opposes”  any investigation on the grounds that “Israel is not a party to the ICC” and that “the Palestinians do not qualify as a sovereign state”.
In response, Fatou Bensouda, then the ICC’s prosecutor, asked the court’s chamber of judges to rule on the issue. The chamber decided  that the ICC does have jurisdiction in the West Bank, Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem.
Bensouda then launched a formal investigation  after conducting a “painstaking preliminary examination” lasting five years.
“I am satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip,” she said. 
But after Bensouda left office in June 2021, the ICC went quiet on the investigation.
                   What is the international criminal court’s stance now?                   
Karim Khan, the British barrister who is the current ICC prosecutor, visited Gaza’s Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Sunday and said “we have active investigations ongoing in relation to the crimes allegedly committed in Israel on the 7 of October and also in relation to Gaza and the West Bank in our jurisdiction going back to 2014”.
Khan invoked the image of “the terrible gas chambers and the Holocaust, the razing of cities” to argue that governments need to stand behind the international legal architecture that was “built on the rubble of the second world war”.
Khan specifically warned that “there should not be any impediment to humanitarian relief supplies going to children, to women and men – civilians”.
“These rights are part of the Geneva conventions, and they give rise to even criminal responsibility when these rights are curtailed under the Rome statute,” he said.
Khan said the ICC would pursue its investigations with “determination” in the face of Israel’s refusal to cooperate with the court and its block on ICC investigators travelling to the country or the occupied territories.
Khan said he would also investigate “current events in the West Bank”, adding that he was “very concerned also by the spike of the number of reported incidents of attack by settlers  against Palestinian civilians”.
                   Are other countries backing the court’s prosecutor?                   
Only three countries have formally called for the ICC to become involved: South Africa, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Micheál Martin, Ireland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said in a radio interview that it was for the ICC to determine if war crimes are being committed. 
Human Rights Watch noted that the silence from other countries is in contrast to the wide demands from European governments for the ICC to investigate Russian war crimes in Ukraine.
                   Does Israel appear worried by talk of an investigation?                   
Yes, very. When the ICC launched its full investigation in 2021, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was “under attack”.
“The ICC, which was established to prevent a repeat of the horrors the Nazis instigated again the Jewish people, now turns against the state of the Jewish people,” he said. “I promise you we will fight for the truth until we will annul this scandalous decision.”
Israel is worried that its military officials and politicians could be detained under international arrest warrants if they travel abroad and face trial at The Hague.
Israel has typically relied on the US’s protection in international bodies, such as vetoing resolutions at the UN security council. But Washington’s influence over the ICC is limited by the fact that the US has itself refused to sign the Rome statute.
In 2020, President Trump revoked Bensouda’s US visa and imposed financial sanctions  on her and another senior prosecutor because of the ICC’s Israel-Palestine investigation and a separate investigation into the US’s actions in Afghanistan.
In response, 67 countries, including close US allies such as the UK, France and Germany, made a statement  expressing “unwavering support for the court as an independent and impartial judicial institution”.
Joe Biden has been more cooperative with the ICC, ordering the US to share evidence  of Russian war crimes in Ukraine with its investigators. But his administration steadfastly opposes the Israel-Palestine probe.
Even if the ICC were to prosecute Israeli officials, it relies on foreign governments to enforce warrants and arrest the accused. Member countries may well feel obliged to cooperate given the continued support for the court, particularly because of Russia’s crimes in Ukraine.
                   What about the Palestinians?                   
Although Hamas’s cross-border attack from Gaza on 7 October was in Israel, it still falls within the ICC’s jurisdiction because the Palestinian armed group operates from within the area under the court’s purview.
But questions remain about the legal status of non-state groups such as Hamas, which is a proscribed terrorist organisation in many countries. After 9/11, the George W Bush administration claimed that al-Qaida and the Taliban were “illegal combatants” and therefore not protected by the Geneva conventions, opening the way for captives to be tortured by the CIA and US military. The US supreme court overturned  that interpretation of international law in 2006 and said the Geneva conventions did apply.
Some international legal scholars have said that as Hamas is the de facto governing authority in Gaza, and Palestine has ratified the Geneva conventions, it is bound by their requirements but also protected by them.
The West Bank is partly governed by the Palestinian Authority. Its foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki met Khan in The Hague last week and effectively endorsed any ICC investigation.

Highlight: Few of Hamas’s senior leaders have been harmed but its ability to govern is reduced and thousands of fighters are dead
Body


Six months after the surprise attacks it launched into Israel, triggering the Gaza conflict, Hamas is weakened and divided but far from defeated, experts, officials and sources close to the militant Islamist organisation say.
Hamas remains in de facto control of swaths of Gaza , including the parts where much of the territory’s population is now concentrated, and has re-established a presence elsewhere. In recent days, Hamas “operatives” armed with batons  have been sighted keeping order on the streets of Khan Younis, the southern city from which Israeli forces withdrew just last week. On Wednesday, rockets targeting a kibbutz in Israel were launched  by militants from Jabaliya in northern Gaza.
Few members of the organisation’s top echelons have been harmed so far and much of its extensive tunnel network remains intact. However, the organisation’s ability to effectively govern is much reduced, its military stores are depleted, and thousands of fighters are dead.
The months-long war has also led to new tensions between Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, and leaders based overseas, mainly in Qatar and Turkey. In recent weeks, bitter arguments have broken out over what would be acceptable terms for a ceasefire and over the future strategy of Hamas, well-informed sources in direct contact with senior Hamas figures said.
One such source said the split was between exiles who favour a nationalist strategy, with Hamas part of an anti-western coalition alongside powers such as Russia or Iran, and a Gaza leadership that has “doubled down” on the organisation’s original Islamist project while remaining committed to the local fight against Israel. Another pointed to deep personal animosity between Sinwar and Khaled Mashal, who is the best known of Hamas’s political leaders.
An emerging problem for Hamas is dissent within Gaza, a consequence of the group’s weakened authority on the population and the massive cost of the 7 October attack.
Though one poll suggested support for the organisation in the territory, there is evidence for deepening anger among many there. In late March, Hamas issued an unprecedented apology  for the suffering caused by the war in Gaza, where famine now looms, and acknowledged the population’s “exhaustion”.
Published on its Telegram channel, the long statement also listed steps taken by the organisation to help ordinary people, such as enforcing lower prices for basic goods amid soaring inflation, and consulting makeshift community organisations that were trying to keep order in the increasingly anarchic territory.
The communique also repeated Hamas’s justification for the war, which it said would lead to the victory and freedom of Palestinians.
One major loss for Hamas – though yet to be fully confirmed – was Marwan Issa, in effect the third in command in Gaza, who is thought by Israeli and US intelligence to have been killed by an Israeli airstrike last month.
Issa was targeted when he moved between underground bunkers in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, Israeli intelligence officials told the Guardian, after it was learned that the 59-year-old would not be with any of the 100 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza,
The strike on Issa was followed by a three-day communications blackout imposed by Hamas commanders concerned that a spy within their ranks had revealed crucial details to Israeli security services that had allowed the attack. A similar precaution was taken after the suspected Israeli assassination of Saleh al-Arouri , the deputy political leader, in Beirut in January, sources close to Hamas said.
Israel has succeeded in infiltrating many Palestinian armed factions – including Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Fatah and others – in the past. Israeli experts say “battlefield detainees”, captured in Gaza and interrogated immediately by officers from specialist units, have provided crucial information. 
“The most important source that we have now is the thousands in captivity … From interrogation we have succeeded in understanding what might be the potential scenarios for where Issa might be hiding. We closed the circles,” said Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, last month.
The Israeli military’s bombing campaign in Gaza has also used a controversial AI-powered database , the Guardian reported last week. 
So far 33,000 people have died in Gaza in the Israeli military offensive, mostly women and children, according to local health authorities. The Hamas attacks in Israel which triggered the war killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and 250 were seized as hostages.
Israeli officials say a third of Hamas’s 30,000 to 40,000 fighters have been killed. Hamas denies this and cites much lower figures. Independent confirmation of either claim is not possible but many analysts say the emphasis on a “kill count” revealed a failure among Israeli strategists to understand the nature of their enemy.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has said repeatedly that an Israeli victory will mean “crushing Hamas”. But, despite massive military power, dismantling the administrative capabilities of the organisation, which has run Gaza since seizing power there in 2007, has proved difficult.
On Monday an Israeli strike killed  the mayor of al-Mawasi refugee camp, designated as a humanitarian zone  early in the conflict. Israel said the official was a terrorist involved in rocket launches. Hamas denounced the attack as a war crime.
Mkhaimar Abusada, a professor of political science at al-Azhar University in Gaza, now in Cairo, estimated that between a fifth and a quarter of the population of Gaza could be described as committed to Hamas, and that their support would not waver whatever disaffection elsewhere.
“At a very minimum, it will be weakened militarily, but this is not going to put an end to Hamas. Hamas will continue at a popular level because of what 2 million or more people have gone through. Even if there are many, many Palestinians who are not happy with Hamas, there are others who will continue to provide support in different places at different times,” he said.
Israel’s strategic decision not to keep troops in areas initially cleared of Hamas fighters has allowed some small-scale military operations to continue. Such efforts are publicised by an impactful and apparently fully functional Hamas media operation that has rallied international support for the organisation throughout the conflict.
At least one of Israel’s war aims may have been achieved, however. “I don’t think there will be a crisis of leadership but Hamas will no longer be able to carry on with armed resistance in the same way after this,” Abusada said.

Highlight: Pressure mounts on Israel and Hamas to make a deal before threatened Rafah offensive Middle East crisis – live updates
Body


An Israeli negotiating team arrived in Paris on Friday for talks about a potential ceasefire in Gaza in the latest sign of tentative progress towards an agreement that could end the five-month-old war.
The Israeli delegation, which includes the heads of its internal and external intelligence services, will meet the director of the CIA, Qatar’s prime minister and Egypt’s most senior intelligence official for talks over the weekend in what appears to be the most serious push for weeks to halt the fighting.
Pressure on Hamas and Israel to conclude a deal is mounting. There are widespread concerns among observers that an imminent Israeli offensive on the city of Rafah in southern Gaza will cause further extensive civilian casualties and that the start of Ramadan in less than three weeks could ignite widespread unrest in the occupied West Bank and exacerbate risks of a regional conflagration.
Israel says Hamas has four battalions of militants in or around Rafah and that its offensive will go ahead if no ceasefire deal is reached soon. Washington has called on its close ally not to launch an assault  on a city packed with more than 1 million people displaced from elsewhere in Gaza.
Rafah is also the entry point for much of the desperately needed aid that is reaching Gaza, and any further disruption to the already inadequate flow of assistance would worsen an acute humanitarian crisis.
Hamas is waiting to see what mediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt bring back from the weekend talks with Israel in Paris, an official from the militant group said on Friday.
“We discussed our proposal with [the Egyptians] and we are going to wait until they return from Paris,” he said.
About 150 of 250 hostages seized by Hamas during its attack on southern Israel in October were released in a swap for Palestinian prisoners during a weeklong ceasefire in November. The attack, which triggered the Israeli offensive in Gaza, also killed 1,200 people, mostly in their homes or at a music festival.
At least 29,514 Palestinians have been killed and 69,616 injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since the beginning of the war, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Friday. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007, saying it uses residents as a human shield.
Though talks on a new deal involving a series of phased ceasefires – each involving the release of a batch of the about 100 hostages still held by Hamas – have repeatedly broken down, both sides may now make concessions, observers say.
Hamas has seen that allied groups such as Hezbollah, the Lebanon-based militant Islamist movement, are not ready to risk all-out war with Israel to support it and has suffered significant casualties, even if no senior leaders have yet been killed in the Israeli onslaught.
Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, needs to improve increasingly fractious relations with Washington  and answer accusations inside Israel that he has sacrificed the return of hostages for his own political survival, analysts say. Between 30 and 50 of the hostages are now thought to be dead and representatives of relatives say time is running out for the remainder.
But a deal would involve painful concessions by Israel – such as the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners from its jails – and a withdrawal from Gaza, so would be opposed by far-right politicians whose support allows Netanyahu to remain in power.
Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, a mass-market newspaper, columnist Nahum Barnea said the chances of reaching an agreement were about 50%.
“No agreement has been reached yet about an exchange deal – responsible sources put the chances at 50% – but a resumption of negotiations appears to be near at hand. After almost a month of impasse, there is hope,” Barnea said.
Throughout the conflict, Netanyahu has said military pressure on Hamas would force concessions and the early return of the hostages.
Israeli planes and tanks continued airstrikes and bombardments  overnight, residents and health officials said. The Gaza health ministry said 104 people had been killed and 160 others wounded in Israeli military strikes in the past 24 hours.
Late on Thursday, Netanyahu presented his security cabinet with an official plan for Gaza after the war.
According to the document, Israel would maintain security control over all land west of Jordan, including the occupied West Bank and Gaza – territories where Palestinians want to create an independent state. Any rehabilitation of Gaza, much of which has been reduced to ruins during the war, is conditional on “complete demilitarisation”.
Netanyahu proposes an Israeli presence on the Gaza-Egypt border in the south of the territory and cooperation with Egypt and the US in that area to prevent smuggling attempts, including at the Rafah crossing.
To replace Hamas rule in Gaza while maintaining public order, the plan proposes working with local representatives “who are not affiliated with terrorist countries or groups and are not financially supported by them” and calls for shutting down UNRWA, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, and replacing it with other international aid groups, emphasising that Israel expects to maintain security control over the territory.
The proposed new administration may involve local clan or community leaders but there is no role for the Palestinian Authority based in the West Bank – the preferred option of Washington.
A spokesperson for Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, told Reuters that Netanyahu’s proposal was doomed to fail, as were any Israeli plans to change the geographic and demographic realities in Gaza.
The last time similar ceasefire talks  were held in Paris, at the end of January, they produced an outline for the first extended ceasefire of the war, approved by Israel and the US. Hamas responded with a counterproposal, which Netanyahu then rejected as “delusional”. 
The current talks in the French capital are aimed at establishing procedural rules for further negotiations that will hammer out a deal, Israeli media reported.

                                                                                        Over 10,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since 7 October, according to new figures released by the Hamas-controlled health authority in the territory.  The total number of deaths now stands at 10,022, including 4,104 children. The number of casualties in Gaza has not been independently verified.                                                                                          The deaths of scores of aid workers in airstrikes on Gaza over the past month has made the conflict the deadliest ever for UN workers.  At least 88 people who worked for the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, have been killed since 7 October, and 47 of its buildings have been damaged. 
Separately, at least 150 health workers have been killed in Gaza – 16 while on duty – and 18 emergency-service workers for Gaza’s civil defence, according to the UN. More than 100 health facilities have been damaged.                                                                                          Israel’s military announced late Sunday it had encircled Gaza City and divided the besieged coastal strip into two. “Today there is north Gaza and south Gaza,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told reporters, calling it a “significant stage” in Israel’s war against the Hamas militant group ruling the territory.                                                                                          The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it is carrying out airstrikes against sites belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.  The IDF said on Monday it had identified about 30 launches from Lebanon towards northern Israel earlier on Monday, and that it was “responding with artillery fire toward the origin of the launches”.                                                                  In its latest situational update,  Israel’s military claims that Israeli jets struck 450 Hamas targets, and claims to have killed Jamal Mussa, who it says “was responsible for the special security operations in the Hamas terrorist organisation”.  The IDF claims have not been independently verified.                                                                                          The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has said the protection of civilians “must be paramount” in the conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas, warning that the Gaza Strip was becoming “a graveyard for children”. Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, responded by saying: “Shame on you.”                                                                                           The leaders of the UN’s major humanitarian agencies as well as international charities have called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” in Gaza, calling the situation “horrific” and “unacceptable” in a rare joint statement.   The signatories included the heads of OCHA, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the WHO, Save the Children and CARE International. They said “An entire population is besieged and under attack, denied access to the essentials for survival, bombed in their homes, shelters, hospitals and places of worship. This is unacceptable.”                                                                                          US secretary of state Antony Blinken has said his discussions in Turkey on Monday had a focus on “efforts to significantly expand the humanitarian assistance to people in need”, and claimed that his visit to the region had helped prevent escalation of the conflict.  Blinken told the media at the airport before departing Turkey “We discussed … efforts to significantly expand the humanitarian assistance to people in need, and efforts to prevent the conflict expanding to other parts of the region. He added “Sometimes the absence of something bad happening may not be the most obvious evidence of progress, but it is.”                                                                                                                                The border authority in Hamas-controlled Gaza has said that the Rafah border crossing is open only for evacuations by Egyptians and foreigners listed since 1 November.  The authority’s statement added that those who were not listed will not be able to cross the border.                                                                                          NEW About 80 dual nationals and 17 medical evacuees had left Gaza to Egypt through the Rafah crossing by early Monday evening, Reuters reported, citing Egyptian security sources, after evacuations were suspended for two days after an ambulance was hit by an Israeli strike in Gaza on Friday. END NEW                                                                                          Lebanon ’s top Christian cleric urged state officials on Monday to shield Lebanon from the war between Israel and Hamas.                                                                                          Thailand ’s prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, has told local media that the country’s chief of defence forces has informed him of a photograph that shows Thai people held by Hamas, saying it was understood this showed the hostages were still alive.                                                                 Palestine telecommunications company Paltel posted to Facebook to say that communications are gradually being restored in the besieged Gaza Strip after a third Israeli-imposed blackout of the conflict.                                                                 The Palestinian health ministry said that one Palestinian was killed and three were wounded by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank village of Halhul, north of Hebron.                                                                 Two Israeli police officers have been seriously injured in a stabbing and shooting attack in Jerusalem. The attacker was killed at the scene by Herod’s Gate in the Old City by officers who responded.                                                                 Israel has reportedly arrested Ahed Tamimi, the Palestinian activist who made global headlines  as a teenager in 2018 when she was arrested and later jailed for slapping and kicking IDF soldiers. Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir,  praised Tamimi’s arrest in a post on Twitter, calling her a “terrorist”.                                                                                          Jordan has airdropped a medical aid package to a hospital in Gaza , King Abdullah II has said in a social media post.  Jordan’s military said in a statement that the medical supplies were dropped via parachutes from a Jordanian Air Force plane.                                                                                                       The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was increasing its humanitarian aid to Gaza by another €25m, bringing total aid to €100m ($107m / £86.5m).                                                                                          Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said in a speech this morning that the situation in the Middle East is “the outcome of a collective political and moral failure” due to “a real lack of willingness to solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem.”                                                                                          Ireland ’s justice minister, Helen McEntee, has said the government is doing everything it can to support the family of an Irish-Israeli girl believed to have been abducted by Hamas. Emily Hand was originally feared dead after the assault on kibbutz Be’eri on 7 October.  However, it was reported in Israel on Sunday that the eight-year-old’s family have been informed she may still be alive and being held hostage.                                                                                          The UK’s Foreign Office said on Monday it was temporarily withdrawing some British embassy staff from Lebanon.  It had already advised Britons against all travel to Lebanon due to the conflict between neighbouring Israel and Gaza, and encouraged any Britons still in the country to leave while commercial flights remain.                                                                                          Bulgaria ’s prime minister, Nikolay Denkov, has visited Jerusalem where he has met Benjamin Netanyahu.                                                                                          South Africa is recalling diplomats from Israel  to assess its relationship with the country, its foreign minister has said, saying that Israel was involved in the “collective punishment” of Palestinians.  “We believe the nature of response by Israel has become one of collective punishment,” Naledi Pandor said, adding the country would continue to call for a comprehensive ceasefire in Palestine.                                                                                          China has said it will do its utmost to restore peace in the Palestinian territories as it takes over the presidency of the UN security council.                                                                                          An Israeli army spokesperson has has welcomed the deployment of a US nuclear missile submarine in the region.  Late on Sunday, US Central Command, which covers the Middle East, said an Ohio-class nuclear missile submarine had arrived  in the region – an unusual public announcement of a nuclear submarine’s position that was seen by many as a direct message to Iran. “It’s always good news to see that the Americans are moving in more assets,” military spokesperson Lt-Col Richard Hecht told the media on Monday, Reuters reports. “We see this as sort of a deterring, stabilising factor in the region.”

Highlight: Territory’s health ministry says most casualties are women and children, and that thousands more may lie under rubbleMiddle East crisis – live updates
Body


Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza has killed 25,000 Palestinians, the health ministry in the territory has announced, as the UN chief described the scale of civilian killings as “heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable”.
Most of the casualties were women and children, the ministry said, and thousands more bodies were likely to remain uncounted under rubble across Gaza.
Speaking at a global summit in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, denounced Israel’s three-month assault. 
“Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary general,” Guterres said at the opening of the G77+China, a coalition of 135 developing countries.
“This is heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable. The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region.”
Israel has ignored international outrage at the toll exacted on Gaza by its offensive, which was launched in response to Hamas’s attack into southern Israel  in which 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians in their homes and at a music festival. Hamas also seized about 250 hostages, of whom 132 remain in Gaza, though at least 27 are believed to have been killed.
Israeli forces are advancing into southern parts of Gaza crowded with those who have fled combat elsewhere. At least a million displaced people are believed to have sought refuge in the small town of Rafah on the border with Egypt, where they are living in makeshift camps, UN-run shelters and private apartments.
Thick plumes of smoke billowed above the main southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday morning as the Israeli army said it had “eliminated a number of terrorists” there.
There were also reports of renewed fighting in the north, which Israeli troops are struggling to clear of Hamas militants who use an extensive tunnel network to launch surprise attacks.
At least 178 bodies had been brought to Gaza’s hospitals in the past 24 hours, along with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Ashraf al-Qidra, a health ministry spokesperson.
The Hamas government’s media office said the dead and injured “could not be transferred to hospitals because of the continued artillery shelling on... Khan Younis and the Tal al-Hawa area in Gaza City and the north”.
In a briefing on Saturday evening, the Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said troops had found a tunnel in Khan Younis where some hostages had previously been kept.
Among the evidence of their presence were paintings, including by a five-year-old captive, he said.
About 20 hostages had been held there at different times, he said, “in difficult conditions without daylight... with little oxygen and terrible humidity”.
Soldiers entered the booby-trapped tunnel and fought a battle with militants in which “the terrorists were eliminated”, Hagari said.
Over the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.
Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly pledged to pursue the offensive in Gaza until “total victory”, but commentators in Israel have questioned the conduct of the war, arguing that the offensive’s goals are unrealistic and accusing the Israeli prime minister of indecision.
On Saturday, Netanyahu again rejected Joe Biden’s call for a Palestinian state  after the war. His office said that in talks on Friday with the US president, Netanyahu “reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.
Grant Shapps, the British defence secretary, said Netanyahu’s refusal was “disappointing” but not a “surprise”. “I don’t think we get to a solution unless there’s a two-state solution,” he told the BBC.
In a small concession to Washington, Israel announced on Sunday it had agreed a plan for frozen Palestinian tax funds to be held by a third-party country.
Netanyahu is under growing domestic pressure to secure the return of the hostages and account for the security failings surrounding the October attack.
Thousands of people protested across Israel on Saturday evening to demand the release of the hostages and early elections to oust Netanyahu.
Avi Lulu Shamriz, the father of Alon Shamriz, a hostage mistakenly killed by Israeli troops earlier in the war, said Netanyahu’s strategy was wrong. “The way we’re going, all the hostages are going to die. It’s not too late to free them,” he said.
Humanitarian officials have repeatedly called for more aid to enter Gaza as disease and famine loom.
Diplomatic efforts have sought to secure more deliveries and a truce similar to the week-long cessation of hostilities in November during which Hamas released dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Guterres said Netanyahu’s refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians was totally unacceptable, and that denying Palestinians the right to statehood “would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security”.
In the restive occupied West Bank,  the Israeli military said it had demolished two houses in Hebron belonging to two Palestinian gunmen who carried out an attack on a road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in November.
Rising tensions and violence across the Middle East have stoked fears of a wider conflagration involving Iranian-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
The biggest fear is of a new conflict on Israel’s northern border, where clashes that began in October have intensified in recent weeks. Analysts say both Israel and Hezbollah are carefully calibrating their use of violence, but that there had been a significant increase, with a far greater risk of inadvertent escalation leading to war.
Two Hezbollah fighters were killed on Sunday when an Israeli drone hit their vehicle in southern Lebanon, security sources said. It was the latest strike in an area where Israel has targeted dozens of Hezbollah fighters. Israel’a military said it did not comment on foreign reports.
Earlier, residents and security officials said a drone killed two people and injured at least four others near the village of Kafra, five miles from the border.
Hezbollah has said its campaign of cross-border strikes has aided Palestinians by stretching Israeli forces and driving tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes. It has come at a cost, with about 140 Hezbollah fighters and at least 25 Lebanese civilians killed, as well as at least nine Israeli soldiers and a civilian.
Underlining the instability in the region, Iranian media said an Israeli strike on Damascus on Saturday had killed the Revolutionary Guards’ spy chief in Syria  and four other Guards members.

Highlight: Death toll rises as Israeli military says Hamas has ‘nowhere to hide’ after launching airstrikes across GazaIsrael-Hamas war latest news
Body


                                                                                        The Israeli military said on Tuesday that Hamas operatives had “nowhere to hide” in Gaza and that its air force was carrying out intensive airstrikes in waves every four hours.  “We will reach them everywhere,” chief military spokesperson Daniel Hagari said in a briefing. The Israeli air force has announced on social media that it is “launching an extensive attack against terror targets of the terrorist organisation Hamas in the Gaza Strip”.                                                                                          The UN human rights chief said on Tuesday                         that Israeli air operations had struck residential buildings, including                          tower blocks, as well as schools and UN buildings across Gaza, resulting in civilian casualties.  Gaza’s health ministry has put Palestinian casualty figures as at least 770 killed and 4,000 wounded by Israeli airstrikes since Saturday. 
They additionally claim that at least another 18 people were killed and 100 injured in the West Bank since Saturday.                                                                                          Israeli media reports that Hamas fighters killed about 900 people inside Israel during the weekend incursion.                                                                                                                 Israel has retaken control of the Gaza border fence breached by Palestinian Hamas gunm                         at the weekend                         , and is planting mines in the parts where the barrier was toppled, the chief military spokesperson said on Tuesday. Hagari said there had been no new infiltrations from Gaza since Monday.                                                                                          The Times of Israel reports that officers are preparing to inform 100 families that their loved ones have been taken hostage by Hamas and are being held in Gaza.  A senior member of the militant group has said it intends to use the dozens of hostages being held in Gaza to secure the release of Palestinians detained in Israel and overseas.                                                                 The Israeli air force confirmed it had flown back “hundreds of IDF soldiers who were abroad” in order to contribute to “the IDF’s efforts to mobilise additional forces to continue fighting”.                                                                 The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said he was sure that Israel was focused exclusively on destroying Hamas in Gaza, and not on attacking Palestinians in general or the wider Arab world.                                                                                          Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran was not involved in the Hamas attack on Israel , but hailed what he called Israel’s “irreparable” military and intelligence defeat.  “We kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime,” Khamenei said in his first televised speech since the attack. “The Zionist regime’s own actions are to blame for this disaster,” he added. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the comments were unacceptable.                                                                                          The Spanish acting foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, said on Tuesday his government opposed the proposed suspension of EU aid to Palestinians.  “This cooperation must continue, we cannot confuse Hamas, which is in the list of EU’s terrorist groups, with the Palestinian population, or the Palestinian Authority or the UN organisations on the ground,” Albares said in an interview with Spanish radio. His views were echoed by France ’s foreign ministry, which issued a statement in Paris this morning saying: “We are not in favour of suspending aid that directly benefits the Palestinian people.”                                                                                          The French foreign ministry has announced that four French nationals have died in the attacks. Thirteen French nationals are still missing, and their situation was considered “very worrying”, the ministry said. Spain has said two of its citizens are still missing.                                                                                          Austria is arranging an evacuation of its citizens from Israel by military transport aircraft on Wednesday, chancellor Karl Nehammer said. Cyprus has said it is ready to help with the evacuation of nationals from third countries who might want to leave Israel.                                                                                          Eighteen Thais have been killed in the conflict, the kingdom’s government said on Tuesday, up from the previous toll of 12. A foreign ministry spokesperson said nine Thai citizens had been wounded and 11 taken hostage. About 30,000 Thais work in Israel.                                                                 Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said Moscow and Washington have not been in contact over the escalation of the conflict.                                                                 The Palestine football team has withdrawn from a tournament in Malaysia. It had been scheduled to compete in the Merdeka Cup in Malaysia from 13-17 October. Israel ’s Euro 2024 qualifier against Switzerland, which was due to be played on Thursday, has already been postponed.

Highlight: The Rafah crossing opens to allow injured Palestinians and some foreign nationals out; the UN says the scale of the tragedy in Gaza is ‘unprecedented’See all our Israel-Hamas war coverage
Body


                                                                                        The scale of tragedy in Gaza is “unprecedented”, the commissioner general for the main UN agency in Palestine has said after visiting the besieged territory  for the first time since 7 October. Philippe Lazzarini of the UNRWA described his visit to the Gaza Strip as “one of the saddest days in my humanitarian work” and urged a “meaningful” humanitarian response to prevent people in Gaza from dying.                                                                                          The Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt opened for the first time on Wednesday , after more than three weeks of brutal conflict to allow the evacuation of dozens of injured Palestinians requiring hospital treatment and hundreds of foreign passport holders. By late Wednesday, at least 335 dual nationals and 76 injured seriously wounded and sick people had crossed the border, with more expected to follow.                                                                                          The families of some British citizens trapped in Gaza have said it is devastating that their loved ones have been turned away from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, as the Foreign Office said the first UK nationals have made it through.  It is understood that initially only two of the 500 people on a list of those eligible to leave were British nationals.                                                                                          An Australian minister confirmed that                                                    20 Australian nationals had crossed the border at Rafah to exit Gaza  on Wednesday.  He  went on to confirm that there are still 65 Australians stuck in Gaza that the government is “supporting” and are being provided consular assistance.                                                                                          US citizens were able to exit Gaza on Wednesday as part of the first group of “probably more than 1,000” people,  Joe Biden said. 
 The US president said the opening of the Rafah border crossing to wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals came after “intense and urgent American diplomacy with our partners in the region”. Some American citizens trapped in the Gaza Strip and their families in the US have launched legal action  after weeks of desperate and futile attempts to exit the war zone.                                                                                          Israeli forces continued to bomb the Palestinian territory from land, sea and air as they pressed their offensive. Another blast shook Jabalia, Gaza’s largest refugee camp, on Wednesday, a day after Palestinian health officials said an Israeli airstrike killed about 50 people  and wounded 150 there. Israel claims it killed a Hamas commander in the attack. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said it has killed Muhammad A’sar,  the commander of Hamas’s anti-tank guided missile array, in the airstrike on Wednesday.                                                                                          Fifteen Israeli soldiers have been killed amid fierce fighting in Gaza , in a series of incidents that have underlined the mounting challenges facing the IDF in their attempts to push further into built-up areas of Gaza. The heaviest loss of life occurred when a “Namer” armoured personnel carrier was hit at about noon on Tuesday by an anti-tank guided missile, killing 11 soldiers and wounding several more.                                                                                          The UN human rights office said Israel’s airstrike on Gaza’s Jabalia refugee camp on Tuesday could amount to war crimes. The agency said it had “serious concerns”  given the “high number of civilian casualties and the scale of destruction” after the strikes. The UN’s humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said the airstrikes were “just the latest atrocity to befall the people of Gaza”  and said the world “seems unable, or unwilling, to act”.                                                                                          The only cancer treatment hospital in Gaza has gone out of service after it ran out of fuel,                          health officials said                           on Wednesday.  The director of the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship hospital told a press conference: “We tell the world – don’t leave cancer patients to a certain death due to the hospital being out of service.”                                                                                          A senior Hamas official said that several hundred                         Israeli and other hostages being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip were subject to the same risk of “death and destruction” that Palestinians have faced.  The warning was made after Hamas said that seven hostages – including three foreign passport holders – were killed on Tuesday in Israeli strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp  in Gaza that caused dozens of fatalities.                                                                                          The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said 8,796 Palestinians, including 3,648 children, have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its campaign of airstrikes and incursions. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify figures from either Israeli or Palestinian authorities.  The UN’s humanitarian office has reported that at least 123 Palestinians, including 34 children, have been killed  in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since 7 October.                                                                                          The UN child rights committee has warned that “grave” human rights violations against children are “mounting by the minute” in Gaza, and called for an immediate ceasefire. “ There are no winners in a war  where thousands of children are killed,” the UN committee on the rights of the child said in a statement on Wednesday.                                                                                          Pope Francis said on Wednesday that a two-state solution was needed for Israel and Palestine. The head of the Catholic church noted  that Jerusalem should be given special status.                                                                                          A senior UN official who sent a letter denouncing the organisation’s failure to protect civilians in Gaza had been subject to a review into allegedly biased social media posts after a pro-Israel lobby group complained. Craig Mokhiber, director of the New York office of the UN high commissioner for human rights, had been subject of complaint over his social media output  and his broadcast interviews had been under review since March.                                                                                          Jordan has told its ambassador to come back from Israel over the war in Gaza,                         the foreign ministry said.   The ambassador would only return to Tel Aviv if Israel halted its war in Gaza and ended “the humanitarian crisis it has caused”, the ministry added.                                                                                          The BBC has announced  it is launching an emergency radio service for Gaza in response to the conflict in the region.

Highlight: Financial sanctions and visa bans imposed on four individuals as US frustration with Israel growsMiddle East crisis – live updates
Body


Joe Biden has issued an executive order targeting Israeli settlers in the West Bank who have been attacking Palestinians, amid fast-growing frustration in Washington at Israel’s trajectory in the midst of its war in Gaza.
The order initially imposes financial sanctions and visa bans  against four individuals, and US officials said they were evaluating whether to punish others involved in attacks that have intensified during the Israel-Hamas war.
According to at least one report before the executive order, options included the potential to sanction officials.
Palestinian authorities say some Palestinians have been killed, and rights groups say settlers have torched cars and attacked several small Bedouin communities, forcing evacuations.
In the order, Biden said that extremist settler violence in the West Bank had “reached intolerable levels and constitutes a serious threat to the peace, security and stability of the West Bank and Gaza, Israel, and the broader Middle East region”.
He said: “These actions undermine the foreign policy objectives of the United States, including the viability of a two-state solution and ensuring Israelis and Palestinians can attain equal measures of security, prosperity, and freedom.
“They also undermine the security of Israel and have the potential to lead to broader regional destabilisation across the Middle East, threatening United States personnel and interests.”
Biden has been facing growing criticism  for his administration’s strong support of Israel as casualties mount in the conflict, which began when Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza, attacked Israel on 7 October. 
The order is a rare step against the US’s closest ally in the Middle East as Biden has pressed Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to show greater restraint in its military operations aimed at rooting out Hamas. 
Biden and other senior US officials have warned repeatedly that Israel must act to stop violence by Israeli settlers  against Palestinians in the West Bank, which Palestinian authorities and activists say has intensified since the Gaza war started. 
The Biden administration had also considered moves targeting two far-right Israeli ministers, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, according to a report on the Axios website.
Last month a US visa ban  was announced for any Israeli settlers implicated in attacks on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
The new order will give the Treasury department the authority to impose financial sanctions on settlers engaged in violence, but is not meant to target US citizens. A substantial number of the settlers in the West Bank hold US citizenship and they would be prohibited under US law from transacting with the sanctioned individuals.
Israel is facing growing international discontent over its repeated refusal to contemplate  the establishment of a viable Palestinian state, amid growing warnings that countries including the US and the UK may be considering unilateral recognition of statehood.
After comments by the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, last week that the UK might consider recognition on the day after the war in Gaza ends, US officials have indicated that the state department has been ordered to examine options for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with security guarantees for Israel.
The state department’s spokesperson, Matthew Miller, declined to give details on its internal work on the issue but told a news briefing that the effort had been an objective of Biden’s administration.
The US and the UK, among other states, have long held up the goal of a Palestinian state as part of a negotiated peace process but recent moves in the midst of the Gaza war have highlighted the increasing sense of international frustration with Netanyahu, who has long worked to prevent a Palestinian state.
The Israeli prime minister has in recent weeks spoken of an extended period of military security control by Israel in Gaza while rejecting a role for any revitalised Palestinian Authority.
Washington and London appear to have indicated a change in emphasis in the sequencing of a recognition of a Palestinian state, which in the past was seen as the final step.
Miller told a state department briefing that the US was “actively pursuing the establishment as an independent Palestinian state, with real security guarantees for Israel, because we do believe that is the best way to bring about lasting peace and security for Israel, for Palestinians and for the region”.
He added: “There are any number of ways that you could go about accomplishing that. There are a number of sequencing of events that you can carry out to accomplish that objective. And we look at a wide range of options and we discuss those with partners in the region as well as other partners inside the United States government.” 
Lord Cameron said the issue of recognising a Palestinian state would be part of a diplomatic process in which the Palestinian people would have to be shown “irreversible progress”.
Axios reported on Wednesday that the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, had asked the state department to conduct a review and present policy options on possible US and international recognition of a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza.
The executive order comes as Biden was due to visit Michigan  on Thursday to rally support from union members in a key presidential battleground state. The Democratic president has faced sharp criticism from Arab and Muslim leaders  over his handling of the war with Hamas, and the shadow of the conflict has some Democrats worrying that it could have a major effect on the outcome of the November election.

Under the withering attacks, 165 people were killed in the past 24 hours, Gazan officials said, while Israel said it had destroyed the apartment of a Hamas leader.
Israeli forces clashed with Hamas militants across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, the Israeli military said, deepening its engagement in the decimated enclave even as the Palestinian death toll from relentless airstrikes in 12 weeks of war soared higher. 
  The Gaza Health Ministry reported Saturday that 165 people had been killed in Israeli airstrikes and artillery attacks in the previous 24 hours, adding to the toll of more than 20,000 people killed in Gaza since the war began with the Oct. 7 Hamas-led raids into Israel.
  The Israeli military said late Friday that it had destroyed a Gaza City apartment of the person it considers the mastermind of those attacks, Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who sits atop the list of the Israel military's most-wanted list in Gaza.
  The army said Mr. Sinwar used the apartment as a hide-out and that it destroyed a tunnel shaft discovered by its troops in the apartment's basement floor, as well as an underground headquarters that served as a nerve center for senior officials from Hamas's military and political wings.
  He was not believed to be in the complex when it was hit, having decamped to the south when the Israeli campaign began.
  As global outrage and impatience grows with the war's devastating human toll, the Biden administration said late Friday that it was bypassing Congress for the second time since the war started for a weapons sale to Israel.
  The State Department approved a proposed $147.5 million sale of artillery munitions and related equipment to Israel, invoking an emergency provision that avoids a congressional review process generally required for arms sales to other nations, the Biden administration said. The department used the same provision this month to facilitate a government sale of about 13,000 rounds of tank ammunition to Israel.
  The Pentagon said in a statement that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken had ''provided detailed justification to Congress that an emergency exists that requires the immediate sale'' to Israel.
  ''The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,'' the statement said, adding: ''It is incumbent on all countries to employ munitions consistent with international humanitarian law.''
  Hamas said in a statement Saturday that the U.S. provision of ammunition to Israel was ''clear evidence of the American administration's full sponsorship of this criminal war.''
  The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing increasing pressure from the United States and many other nations to lower the conflict's intensity, but he said last week that Israel would be ''deepening'' the fighting in coming days.
  At a televised news conference on Saturday, Mr. Netanyahu vowed again that Israel would not stop its campaign until it achieved victory, and said that the war would continue for ''many more months.'' 
  Israeli airstrikes and artillery pounded central and southern Gaza on Saturday, striking areas where hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians were told by Israel to congregate for safety from the onslaught across the territory, according to the Palestinian news media.
  Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, including several commanders, but it has failed to locate Mr. Sinwar, whose killing or capture would be a significant blow to Hamas. Israel,has offered $400,000 to anyone who can provide information leading to his arrest.
  A founding member of Hamas in the 1980s, Mr. Sinwar spent decades in Israeli prisons after being arrested in 1988 and convicted of murdering four Palestinians who were suspected of collaborating with Israel.
  Despite having received a life sentence, he was released in 2011 as one of the 1,026 Palestinians freed from Israeli jails in exchange for the release of an Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, whom Hamas had abducted five years earlier. Upon Mr. Sinwar's release, he committed himself to obtaining the release of other Palestinians incarcerated in Israel.
  The army statement on Friday described the underground headquarters connected to Mr. Sinwar's apartment as part of a network of tunnels ''in which senior officials of the Hamas terrorist organization moved and operated.''
  The headquarters was described as about 20 yards underground, which Israel said was deeper than other tunnels. The army said it had ventilation and electricity, and was linked to sewage lines. It led to a tunnel about 250 yards long that the army said contained rooms for prayers and for resting, and stocked for an extended hide-out.
  ''The tunnel was built so that it would be possible to stay inside it and conduct combat from it for long periods of time,'' the army statement said.
  Hamas's top leaders are believed to be sheltering in deep tunnels under Gaza along with most of the group's fighters and the remaining hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attacks. Although the Israeli army says it has demolished at least 1,500 shafts, experts believe the underground infrastructure to be largely intact.
  Israel's search-and-destroy missions and its intensive bombardments have come at the cost of thousands of women, children and other noncombatants killed.
  Unverified video footage from local journalists in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where large numbers of displaced people have fled, showed the immediate aftermath of strikes on residential homes. In chaotic scenes in narrow crowded streets, people carried the injured out from the rubble, wrapped in blankets. Other wounded were ferried by hand, as several men struggled to carry a man's limp body.
  Israeli airstrikes also hit parts of central Gaza that were under Israeli evacuation orders issued this week. More than 150,000 people are affected by those orders, according to the United Nations, though it was unclear how many have fled. The strikes forced some families who have already been uprooted numerous times into yet more difficult decisions about whether to move again.
  A strike on the home of a journalist in the central Gaza town of Nuseirat killed him and a number of his family members and injured several others, according to Palestinian media.
  More journalists have been killed in the 12 weeks of the Gaza war than have ever been killed in a single country over an entire year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which calculates that at least 69 journalists and media workers had been killed since Oct. 7.

Israel's Goal Of No Hamas Sows Doubts

Israel has vowed time and again to eliminate the group responsible for the brutal Oct. 7 attack, but critics increasingly see that goal as unrealistic or even impossible.
Standing before a gray backdrop decorated with Hamas logos and emblems of a gunman that commemorate the bloody Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Osama Hamdan, the organization's representative in Lebanon, professed no concern about his Palestinian faction being dislodged from Gaza. 
  ''We are not worried about the future of the Gaza Strip,'' he recently told a crowded news conference in his offices in Beirut's southern suburbs. ''The decision maker is the Palestinian people alone.''
  Mr. Hamdan thus dismissed one of Israel's key objectives since the beginning of its assault on Gaza: to dismantle the Islamist political and military organization that was behind the massacre of about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials, and which still holds more than 100 hostages.
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has repeatedly emphasized that objective even while facing mounting international pressure to scale back military operations. The Biden administration has dispatched senior envoys to Israel to push for a new phase of the war focused on more targeted operations rather than sweeping destruction.
  And critics both within Israel and outside have questioned whether resolving to destroy such a deeply entrenched organization was ever realistic. One former Israeli national security adviser called the plan ''vague.''
  ''I think that we have reached a moment when the Israeli authorities will have to define more clearly what their final objective is,'' President Emmanuel Macron of France said this month. ''The total destruction of Hamas? Does anybody think that's possible? If it's that, the war will last 10 years.''
  Since it first emerged in 1987, Hamas has survived repeated attempts to eliminate its leadership. The organization's very structure was designed to absorb such contingencies, according to political and military specialists. In addition, Israel's devastating tactics in the Gaza war threaten to radicalize a broader segment of the population, inspiring new recruits.
  Analysts see the most optimal outcome for Israel probably consisting of degrading Hamas's military capabilities to prevent the group from repeating such a devastating attack. But even that limited goal is considered a formidable slog.
  Hamas is rooted in the ideology that Israeli control over what it regards as Palestinians lands must be opposed by force, a tenet likely to endure, experts said.
  ''As long as that context is there, you will be dealing with some form of Hamas,'' said Tahani Mustafa, senior Palestine analyst at the International Crisis Group think tank. ''To assume that you can simply uproot an organization like that is fantasy.''
  The Israeli military said this week that it had killed about 8,000 Hamas fighters out of a force estimated at 25,000 to 40,000. But it is unclear how the count is being made. About 500 have surrendered, according to the military, though Hamas has denied that all were from its ranks.
  The military has at times delivered positive progress reports on its objectives, describing as ''imminent'' full control over the areas in northern Gaza where it began its ground offensive in late October.
  But Mr. Netanyahu acknowledged on Sunday that the war ''is exacting a very heavy cost from us'' as the military announced that 15 soldiers had been killed in the previous 48 hours alone. Rockets are still being fired almost daily from southern Gaza into Israel, albeit far fewer than before.
  Michael Milshtein, a former senior intelligence officer for Israel, criticized statements by some Israeli leaders depicting Hamas as being at its breaking point, saying that might create false expectations about the length of the war.
  ''They've been saying this for a while, that Hamas is collapsing,'' Mr. Milshtein said. ''But it's just not true. Every day, we're facing tough battles.''
  The Israeli military distributed fliers in Gaza recently offering cash for information leading to the arrest of four Hamas leaders.
  ''Hamas has lost its power. They couldn't fry an egg,'' said the flier in Arabic, quoting a folk expression. ''The end of Hamas is near.''
  The military promised $400,000 for Yahya Sinwar, Hamas's leader in Gaza, and $100,000 for Mohammed Deif, head of its military wing, the Qassam Brigades. The two are considered the architects of the Oct. 7 attack.
  Although long among the most wanted men in Gaza, the elusive Mr. Deif has avoided assassination or capture. The only picture of him in public is a decades-old headshot.
  The bounties appeared to be another indication that Israel is struggling to remove the Hamas leadership.
  The group's top echelon are believed to be sheltering, along with most of its fighters and the remaining hostages, in deep tunnels. Although the Israeli army has said that it demolished at least 1,500 shafts, experts consider the underground infrastructure is largely intact.
  The tunnels, built over 15 years, are believed to be so extensive, estimated at hundreds of miles long, that Israelis call them the Gaza Metro.
  ''Hamas is actually weathering this assault quite well,'' said Tareq Baconi, an author who wrote a book about the group. ''It's still showing that it has an offensive military capability.''
  Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel's National Security Council, said Hamas had demonstrated the ability to quickly replace commanders who are killed with others equally capable and equally devoted.
  ''From a professional point of view, I must give credit to their resilience,'' he said. ''I cannot see any signs of collapse of the military abilities of Hamas nor in their political strength to continue to lead Gaza.''
  Hamas is rooted in the Muslim Brotherhood, which was born in Egypt in 1928 as a religious social reform movement but has often been blamed for fomenting jihadist violence in recent decades. Israel once allowed the group to grow as an Islamist counterweight to the more mainstream and secular Palestine Liberation Organization.
  In one of Israel's first, notorious efforts to dismantle Hamas, in 1992, it deported 415 of its leaders and allies, dumping them in a buffer zone along the Israel-Lebanon border. Over the months before their return, they built an alliance with Lebanon's Hezbollah, the most powerful Iran-backed militia in the region.
  The United States and Israel condemn both Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations.
  A string of Israeli assassinations of Hamas political, military and religious leaders also failed to weaken the group. It won control of Gaza in free Palestinian elections in 2006, then evicted its more moderate rival, the Palestinian Authority, in a bloody conflict the next year.
  Israel fought three other wars in Gaza targeting Hamas between 2008 and the current crisis.
  The operations of the Hamas military wing, the Qassam Brigades, remain opaque. The units were designed to continue functioning even if Israel destroyed parts.
  Divided geographically, its five main brigades were in northern Gaza; Gaza City; central Gaza; and two southern cities, Khan Younis and Rafah.
  Most of the elite troops were in the two northern brigades, which constitute about 60 percent of the force, said an Israeli military official who requested anonymity under military regulations. About half of them have been killed, wounded, arrested or fled south, the official claimed.
  For Israel, the aim is first to dismantle the government, then to disperse the fighters and eliminate the commanders and their primary subordinates, the Israeli official said.
  But Azzam Tamimi, a Palestinian journalist and member of the Muslim Brotherhood who has written a book about Hamas, said the group was prepared for that.
  ''The top leadership can disappear at any time because they can be killed, they can be arrested, they can be deported,'' he said. ''So they developed this mechanism of the easy transfer of command.''
  The Qassam Brigades are divided into battalions, with even smaller units defending individual neighborhoods. Other specialized battalions include an anti-tank unit, a tunnel-construction unit and an air wing whose drones and paragliders were an important element of the surprise attack on Oct. 7, according to analysts and former military and intelligence officials.
  The Nukhba Brigade, consisting of about 1,000 highly trained fighters, also appears to have played a central role on Oct. 7.
  Trying to eliminate Hamas entirely would require fighting from street to street and house to house, and Israel lacks both the time and personnel, said Elliot Chapman, a Middle East analyst with Janes, a defense analysis firm.
  As the United States found in attempting to squash Al Qaeda or the Taliban, the organizations tend to spring back once the armed pressure is lifted. The Gaza fight has been compared to the campaign to wrest Mosul, Iraq, from the Islamic State less than a decade ago, but there are significant differences.
  Notably, Hamas is organic to Gaza -- it grew out of frustration with the mainstream factions abandoning the armed struggle against the Israeli occupation. Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, and according to its founding charter, is committed to its destruction.
  The scale of Israel's war is likely to radicalize a new generation: More than 20,000 Gazans have been reported killed thus far, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
  Some Gazans curse Hamas, even taking to the airwaves or social media to do it, despite the organization's history of repressing opponents. Other Gazans, however, say that they still back ''the resistance,'' and Hamas has long attracted support by providing services like schools and clinics.
  A recent poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that most respondents endorsed the Hamas attack on Israel. Support for Hamas in Gaza since the war started has risen to 42 percent, from 38 percent, the poll reported.
  At best, Israel can probably contain Hamas, experts said.
  But even if Israel somehow succeeded in dismantling the group in Gaza, there are still branches in the West Bank and abroad, in places like Lebanon and Turkey, that could revive it.
  ''The right way to think about it is to degrade the organization to the point that it is no longer a sustainable threat,'' said Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired C.I.A. officer who specialized in Middle East counterterrorism.
  ''You cannot just have a strategy of killing everybody,'' he added. ''You have to have that day-after scenario.''

Highlight: Family trees have been dismembered, and whole branches obliterated, since the war between Israel and Hamas broke out on Oct. 7.
Body


People whispered that Nasser al-Astal had come undone, dazed by grief. Weeks after the Israeli airstrike that he said had crashed into his family’s home, his words came in loud, quivering spurts, darting frantically from memory to memory, from loss to loss — his wife, two of their sons and four of their daughters, all dead.
A daughter-in-law and a son-in-law, dead. His older brother and his family, dead. His first grandchild, dead, he said, his second never born: His elder son’s wife had been pregnant.
“When I look at photos of my family on my phone, I cry to myself at night,” Mr. al-Astal said in a phone interview a few weeks after his loss. “But men hide their tears, so I try to do it away from people, alone.”
All of their names were there in black and white on a list of 6,747 Palestinians who Gaza health officials said had been killed by Israeli attacks in the first 19 days of the war. No. 14: his wife, Marwa al-Astal, 48. No. 84: their granddaughter, 1, also named Marwa.
The first 88 people on the list were all from the extended al-Astal family. The next 72 were Hassounas. The next 65 al-Najjars. The next 60 al-Masrys. The next 49 al-Kurds.
Such numbers capture the magnitude of Gaza’s loss like little else: family trees dismembered, whole branches of them obliterated.
It has been almost two months since the list was released on Oct. 26, and the death toll given by Gaza’s Health Ministry has nearly tripled, approaching 20,000.
A ministry spokesman, Ashraf al-Qudra, said early last month that more than 100 people in the Astal family alone had been killed in Israeli attacks. Of 88 family members on the Oct. 26 list, 39 were identified as children and 25 as women.
Israel’s war in Gaza is killing women and children at a faster pace than in almost any other conflict in the world this century.
A few of the family’s dead were linked to Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that has ruled Gaza for 16 years and that led the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel that killed about 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials.
One family member, Hamdan al-Astal, appears to have been among those who attacked Israel. He was not on the Oct. 26 list, but Palestinian news media in Gaza reported his death the day after the assault, saying he had participated.
Another family member who survived, Yunis al-Astal, is a longtime Hamas lawmaker and firebrand sheikh who has compared Jews to bacteria and apes and said it was justifiable to “wipe them out of existence.”
Ten days after Hamdan al-Astal’s death was reported, family members buried Ramzi al-Astal, also identified in Palestinian news media as a Hamas fighter.
Relatives and local news media said he was killed when an Israeli airstrike leveled his home, along with his wife and sons Muhammad, 17, and Karim, 11. One of Ramzi’s brothers and at least five nieces and nephews, the youngest 9, were on the list.
They were just some of the thousands of civilians who have become casualties of Israel’s campaign to eradicate Hamas, family members said.
“If you want to assassinate him, assassinate him alone,” said Sami al-Astal, a distant relation, referring to Ramzi al-Astal. “If you want to assassinate him, why did you do it with his children and his family while they were at home?”
Sami al-Astal, a humanities dean at Al Aqsa University in Khan Younis, the southern Gaza city where much of his extended family lives, said some relatives supported Hamas, while others supported other Palestinian political factions, or none at all. Some were plumbers or doctors — ordinary citizens.
He was for peace, he said, and opposed killing any civilians.
Israel has moved with staggering force in its drive to wipe out Hamas, striking more than 22,000 targets in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to the military.
An estimated 20,000 to 40,000 Hamas fighters live in Gaza, an impoverished, narrow strip of land home to more than two million Palestinians.
Civilians have virtually no safe places to hide or ways to escape. The density of Gaza, where extended families often live together in multistory buildings and have crowded in even more for shelter during the war, turbocharges the potential civilian toll of many airstrikes. It also makes it difficult to separate combatants from civilians, and Israel accuses Hamas of intentionally placing members in or near hospitals, schools and homes.
Hamas is “unlawfully embedding their military assets in densely populated civilian areas, showing blatant disregard for the civilians in Gaza by using them as human shields,” said Nir Dinar, an Israeli military spokesman.
But human rights advocates, many governments and a growing number of experts say that Israel may be violating international laws against putting civilians at “excessive” risk, laws that require it to do its utmost to protect noncombatants by, for example, giving warnings or waiting until a target leaves home to strike.
Israel’s closest ally is also asking it to do more to protect civilians.
“The United States is unequivocal: International humanitarian law must be respected,” Vice President Kamala Harris said this month. “Too many innocent Palestinians have been killed.”
Even if Hamas uses civilians as human shields, those civilians are entitled to full protection under international law unless they directly participate in the fighting, said Janina Dill, an Oxford professor who studies the laws of war. Potential war crimes by Hamas cannot justify potential war crimes by Israel, she added.
“There’s no guilt by association in international law,” she said. “Even if a family is sympathetic to Hamas, voted for them, made supportive statements — none of them is a legitimate target at any time.”
Amid a growing international outcry over casualties, Israel has insisted that it is taking “all feasible measures” to protect civilians, mainly by telling them to evacuate areas with the heaviest fighting. Gazans, however, say the places they flee to are also being struck.
An Israeli military legal adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity under military rules, argued that Israel was not violating international law. When considering any individual strike, he said, factors including Hamas’s proximity to Israel, its threat of rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and its large weapons stockpile could affect the threshold for what is considered proportionate harm to civilians.
Yet, Professor Dill said, the scale of Israel’s onslaught, along with comments by Israeli leaders that they are more focused on damage than accuracy, cast doubt on the claim that they are acting legally. Israel is deploying powerful unguided bombs in dense areas and targeting every type of building normally considered a civilian building, and therefore legally protected in most cases, she said.
Sheer probability dictated that the war would plow straight into the Astal clan. One of the largest and most influential families in southern Gaza, the Astals number in the thousands, said Sami al-Astal, who moonlights as a family historian.
Al-Astals have worked as mayors, farmers, doctors and fruit exporters. Others have been waiters and construction workers in Israel or distinguished themselves as medical researchers abroad, he said.
Strikes are battering Gaza so fast that Islam al-Astal, 47, who is distantly related to Nasser and Sami, said she barely had time to count the relatives, old classmates, friends and neighbors who have been killed, let alone mourn them.
“We need time,” she said, “time to breathe, to cry, to feel the normal things in the middle of all this ugliness.”
On Oct. 9, local news media in Gaza reported that an Israeli airstrike on a house belonging to one branch of the Astals killed at least 10 people. Two days later, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said Israel had hit another al-Astal home.
At least four more strikes have chopped into the family tree since then, according to Palestinian news agency reports. In all, the family has been struck at least eight times over the past two months, according to relatives and those news reports.
The Israeli military said it could not address questions about specific strikes on the Astals.
Nasser al-Astal, whose wife, some children, a grandchild as well as his older brother and his brother’s family were killed on Oct. 22, said he was working as a security guard at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis around 3 a.m. when he got the call.
A relative told him that an Israeli airstrike had crushed the three-story house that he and his family shared with his brother’s family. They were coming to the hospital, alive and dead.
He ran to the emergency room in bare feet, he said. His colleagues tried to calm him as he rushed from one daughter to the next, daughters who had spent recent nights curled up next to him as they slept.
“When will they help us?” his eldest daughter, Hafsa, 24, gasped before she died, he said.
Hours later, after neighbors pulled them from the rubble, more bodies of family members arrived. By 3 p.m., Mr. al-Astal said, he had lowered all of them into the family cemetery.
Before the war, there were more than 100 empty plots there, Sami al-Astal said. Now, they were all full. Mr. al-Astal said he buried the women in one mass grave, the men in another.
The memories were tumbling through his mind and he could not stop talking, about his daughters and granddaughter and about Marwa, his wife of nearly 30 years. He had fallen in love with her when he was 15 and she was 13 and lived down the street, he said.
She had always known how to survive Gaza’s many trials, becoming expert in economizing when money was tight and their sons’ university bills were due. She would split their one Friday chicken among 10 people. When it became too difficult to buy bread, she made flatbread.
“She’s the kind of woman who makes you laugh and smile. She was so kind to me, so affectionate to me,” he said, recalling how she had nursed sick neighbors. “I loved her in good times and in bad times. I can’t imagine that I’ll ever marry another woman.”
The hospital where he worked was a bedlam of screaming patients, bone-tired staff and newly homeless people, but administrators found a small room for him. Though many there were weeping, they seemed to recognize that he, especially, needed somewhere private to cry.
On the Oct. 26 list, Nasser and Marwa’s oldest son, Hamza, 26, was No. 36. Their second son, Muhammad, 22, was on it, as were their daughters — Hafsa, 24; Sarah, 19; Fatima, 15; and Weam, 11.
His older brother Muhammad al-Astal and his family, along with his 3-year-old grandson, were listed, too. His 4-year-old grandson died of his wounds a few days after the list was published.
Nasser al-Astal still had his son Suleiman, 16, and his daughter Shaima, 13, who were wounded. He said he hoped Shaima would become a nurse to treat those injured in war with Israel.
And Suleiman?
“I’ll send my son to university to become a journalist,” he said, “so he can expose the crimes of the Israeli occupation.”

Hezbollah Fires Rockets at Israel in Response to Killing in Beirut

Israel said it had fired back at militants involved in the rocket launches, but the exchange stopped short of a major escalation.
The Lebanese militia Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward a small military base in northern Israel on Saturday, in what the group said was an initial response to the assassination of a senior Hamas commander in Lebanon five days ago that has raised fears of a wider conflict.
Hezbollah said in a statement that the strikes had caused casualties, but the Israeli military said no one was hurt. The assault was initially perceived by analysts as more a symbolic response to the killing than a significant escalation.
The Israeli military said in a statement that roughly 40 rockets had been fired from Lebanon toward Mount Meron, an area housing a military radar station that is roughly five miles south of the Israeli-Lebanese border. The military said that it had responded by striking a militant group in Lebanon that had been involved in the rocket fire, without specifying its identity.
Hezbollah could still respond with a more forceful attack, while Hamas has yet to retaliate for the assassination of the senior commander, Saleh al-Arouri. Mr. al-Arouri was killed on Tuesday in Beirut, Lebanon’s capital, in an attack attributed by Hamas and Hezbollah to Israel. Lebanese and U.S. officials have also ascribed the attack to Israel, though Israel has not confirmed its role.
At least for now, the limited nature of the exchange on Saturday tempered fears that Mr. al-Arouri’s killing would immediately lead to a major escalation between Hezbollah and Israel.
“There may be something yet to come,” said Nicholas Blanford, a Beirut-based analyst and historian of Hezbollah. But for now, Mr. Blanford said, “It’s just another day in the south.”
The tit-for-tat exchanges were “within a certain threshold,” he added.
The exchange came as Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, and Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s top diplomat, separately visited the region in an effort to reduce the risk of a regional war.
Hamas attacked Israel from Gaza on Oct. 7, leading Israel to respond in Gaza with one of the deadliest military campaigns this century. At the same time, Israel had been engaged in a low-level second conflict with Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas and a fellow proxy of Iran.
That second front has mostly been contained within the border areas of northern Israel and southern Lebanon, with both sides generally limiting their strikes to within a few miles of the border, far from major cities like Tel Aviv or Beirut.
But the killing of Mr. al-Arouri, in a building deep inside a Hezbollah stronghold in southern Beirut, prompted fears that Hezbollah might respond with a more forceful attack of its own on major cities in central Israel. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has made two speeches since the assassination, most recently on Friday, in which he pledged that the killing would not go “unpunished.”
He avoided going into detail, amid assessments by analysts that he wanted to prevent a major escalation that would provoke an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. During the last major conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, in 2006, Israel pummeled parts of Beirut and invaded parts of southern Lebanon — an outcome that other Lebanese leaders have said they hope to avoid more than 17 years later.
“It seems to me that Hezbollah has no interest in escalating this into a full-blown conflict,” Mr. Blanford said. “The question now is what the Israelis are going to do.”
Thousands of residents of northern Israel have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the war to protect them from the daily exchanges of fire along the border. In order for them to return home, Israel wants Hezbollah fighters to withdraw from the border areas of southern Lebanon.
For now, the United States is involved in diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions — but if that fails, Israel’s government has hinted that it may resort to a more aggressive military operation, and possibly even an invasion of Lebanon.
The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a U.S. envoy, Amos Hochstein, on Thursday that Israel would not stop until the residents of northern Israel can return safely to their homes, a goal that it would pursue “diplomatically, which Israel prefers, or in some other way,” according to a government readout.
Mr. Blinken was in Turkey on Saturday, meeting with his Turkish counterpart and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, with whom he discussed the need to keep the Gaza conflict from spreading, among other subjects, according to a State Department statement. Later, he met with Greece’s prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, on the island of Crete.
Speaking to reporters, Mr. Blinken said that “we want to do everything possible to make sure we don’t see escalation” in the violence between Israel and Hezbollah. He also noted that Turkey could play a role in a plan for postwar Gaza.
“I think from our conversations today, it’s clear that Turkey is prepared to play a positive, productive role in work that needs to happen the day after the conflict ends,” he said, adding that Turkey could also use its ties with countries in the region to “to do everything possible to de-escalate and to prevent the conflict from spreading.”
Mr. Borrell, the European Union diplomat, was visiting Lebanon, where he said his priority was to “avoid regional escalation and to advance diplomatic efforts” for peace in the region.
Mr. Borrell has been at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to ensure that the war in Gaza ends with an attempt to create a Palestinian state in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. For now, that appears a distant prospect, however, with Israeli strikes and ground operations continuing inside Gaza on Saturday with multiple people killed, according to Wafa, a news agency run by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The strikes targeted areas in Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah, three cities where more than a million Palestinians displaced by Israeli military operations have fled. According to the U.N., Rafah, a small area next to the Egyptian border, now houses roughly half of the Gaza Strip’s prewar population of 2.2 million. 
More than 22,000 people in Gaza have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since the war began, according to Gazan health authorities.
With widespread fuel, food and water shortages, “Gaza has simply become uninhabitable,” according to a statement released on Friday by Martin Griffiths, the head of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Mohammad al-Masri, a 31-year-old accountant in Rafah, said he had heard strikes overnight.
“No one thinks they are safe here,” said Mr. al-Masri, who fled to the area earlier in the war.
“What is protecting us except for a few pieces of nylon?” he added, referring to the tents that house many of the displaced people in Rafah.

As rockets from Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces streamed in from Lebanon, Israeli officials said they were prepared to take the war to a second front.
As Israel pounded targets in the Gaza Strip from the air and sea on Wednesday, a member of the country's war cabinet threatened action on a second front, along the border with Lebanon, where the Iranian-backed militia Hezbollah has fired rocket barrages into Israel. 
  ''I say to our friends around the world: The situation in the northern border necessitates change,'' the war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, told reporters. ''The time for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the government of Lebanon don't act to stop the fire toward northern communities and to push Hezbollah away from the border, the I.D.F. will do that.'' The reference was to the Israel Defense Forces.
  The threat of a wider war has preoccupied the United States and its allies since the start of the conflict in Gaza, and has only grown as three Iranian-backed groups -- Hamas, Hezbollah and Houthis in Yemen -- launch attacks toward Israel as well as on commercial ships in the Red Sea. The concern prompted the United States to dispatch two aircraft carriers to the Eastern Mediterranean in the weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.
  The Israeli military said Wednesday that its northern command, along the border with Lebanon, was in a ''state of very high readiness.'' The military's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said, ''We need to be prepared to strike if required.''
  Tensions rose even higher this week after Iran accused Israel of killing Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, a senior adviser to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, in a missile strike in Syria. On Wednesday, a cortège of mourners accompanied his body through the Iraqi cities of Najaf and Karbala, and a representative of the Revolutionary Guard, Ramezan Sharif, again threatened retaliation against Israel, The Associated Press reported.
  Hints of division among Israel's adversaries emerged on Wednesday when Mr. Sharif claimed that Hamas's Oct. 7 attack was prompted not by longstanding grievances with Israel but for the 2020 killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, head of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. Hamas promptly rejected the suggestion.
  American officials have been wary that tit-for-tat attacks in the region could escalate into a larger, regional fight, but early on Tuesday, the United States conducted a round of airstrikes in Iraq on facilities it said were being used by Iranian proxies. The strikes followed a series of attacks by the militants in Iraq, including a drone attack hours earlier on an Erbil air base in which three American service members were injured.
  An Israeli official said Wednesday that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken plans to visit Israel in early January to discuss the war in Gaza and plans for how the Palestinian territory will be governed when the conflict ends. The visit will be Mr. Blinken's fourth to the region since the Oct. 7 attacks. On each of his earlier trips, Mr. Blinken has also stopped in several Arab capitals.
  Israel has been under pressure by European governments and the United Nations to agree to an immediate cease-fire, but with Hamas and Israel staking out seemingly intractable conditions in public, diplomats said it appeared that a deal for a lasting truce remained far off.
  In Israel on Wednesday, a day after the Israeli military said it had expanded operations in central areas of Gaza, air raid sirens sounded along the border at least three times -- a measure of the seeming durability of Hamas's capabilities to fight and threaten Israel.
  Since the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, Hamas and other armed groups have fired about 12,000 rockets from Gaza into Israel, a quarter of them on Oct. 7, according to the Israeli government. Israel has hit Gaza with a near-relentless barrage of strikes, killing what health officials say is more than 20,000 people.
  More than 11 weeks after the Hamas-led attack that set off the war, the Gazan Health Ministry said Wednesday that Israel had returned the bodies of 80 Palestinians to Gaza.
  An Israeli official said that Israeli soldiers sweeping Gaza in search of hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups had taken the bodies to Israel to determine if any of them were the remains of hostages. The Israeli authorities then coordinated with Palestinian officials to send them back to Gaza, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.
  In Gaza, Israeli soldiers were engaged in house-to-house battles in a neighborhood outside Gaza City, where there has been fighting for weeks, the military said. Earlier this week, General Halevi said that the military was ''close to completing'' the dismantling of Hamas battalions in northern Gaza, but that given the dense urban environment, ''it cannot be said that we killed them all.''
  The war, he said, ''will continue for many more months.''
  Since the start of the conflict, both Israel and Hamas have made hard-line statements in public even as talks have continued in private, often through the Qatari government, which brokered a November truce that opened the door to a hostage-for-prisoner exchange and more humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
  The Egyptian government has circulated a proposal calling for further exchanges of hostages and prisoners as a step toward a permanent cease-fire, according to three diplomats in the region who insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. But the diplomats cautioned that neither Israel nor Hamas appeared close to agreeing.
  On Monday night, Israel's war cabinet discussed various truce proposals on the table, including the Egyptian one, according to an Israeli official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations. In public, Israeli officials have continued to tell the public to expect a long and difficult war ahead.
  Hamas, in public statements, has appeared to dismiss any deal to release the remaining hostages if it does not include a sustainable end to hostilities. In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Zaher Jabareen, a member of the group's political leadership, said the first step had to be an end to the killing of people in Gaza.
  ''Our position, which we communicated to all the parties, is that we are asking for a comprehensive cease-fire before we talk about other issues,'' he said.

With the U.S.-led attacks in Yemen, there is no longer a question of whether the Israel-Hamas war will escalate into a wider conflict. The question is whether it can be contained.
From the outbreak of the Israeli-Hamas war nearly 100 days ago, President Biden and his aides have struggled to keep the war contained, fearful that a regional escalation could quickly draw in American forces. 
  Now, with the American-led strike on nearly 30 sites in Yemen on Thursday and a smaller strike the next day, there is no longer a question of whether there will be a regional conflict. It has already begun. The biggest questions now are the conflict's intensity and whether it can be contained.
  This is exactly the outcome no one wanted, presumably including Iran.
  ''We're not interested in a war with Yemen. We're not interested in a conflict of any kind,'' John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, said on Friday. ''In fact, everything the president has been doing has been trying to prevent any escalation of conflict, including the strikes last night.''
  Mr. Biden's decision to unleash airstrikes, after resisting calls to act against the Yemen-based Houthi militants whose repeated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea were beginning to take a toll on global commerce, is a clear shift in strategy. After issuing a series of warnings, officials said, Mr. Biden felt his hand was forced after a barrage of missile and drone attacks on Tuesday were directed at an American cargo ship and the Navy vessels around it.
  ''This is already a regional war, no longer limited to Gaza, but already spread to Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen,'' said Hugh Lovatt, a Mideast expert for the European Council on Foreign Relations. Washington, he added, wanted to demonstrate that it was ready to deter Iranian provocations, so it conspicuously placed its aircraft carriers and fighters in position to respond quickly. But those same positions leave the United States more exposed.
  Over the course of 12 weeks, attacks on Israeli, American and Western interests have come from Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, prompting modest, carefully targeted responses from American and Israeli forces. The United States also issued warnings to Iran, which the Americans say is acting as a loose coordinator.
  What was notable about the retaliatory strike in Yemen was its breadth: Employing fighter jets and sea-launched missiles, U.S. and British forces, backed up by a small number of other allies, hit a wide number of Houthi missile and drone sites.
  Mr. Biden is walking the fine line between deterrence and escalation, and his aides concede there is no science to the calculation. Tehran and its allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been careful in their support for Hamas, keeping their actions within limits, to prevent a larger American military response that could threaten Tehran's exercise of power in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria.
  But how much control Iran has over its proxies is in question, and its leaders may also be misreading American and Israeli red lines.
  The Houthis, a small Iranian-backed tribe in Yemen, have been among the most aggressive in pushing the envelope, trying to block international trading routes through the Red Sea and ignoring American and Western warnings to desist.
  Houthi officials say that the sole goal of their attacks is to force Israel to halt its military campaign and to allow the free flow of aid into Gaza.
  Western diplomats said that there had been reluctance to strike back at the Houthis, in part to avoid upending a truce in the Yemeni civil war, and in part because of the difficulty of eliminating their threat entirely. But the Houthis' repeated attacks on ships, their direct fire on American helicopters, and their attack Tuesday on an American cargo vessel, left the United States with what officials said was no real choice. 
  U.S. officials said the Pentagon carried out a second round of strikes on Friday against the Houthis, bombing a radar facility in Yemen.
  It is not known how long it will take the Houthis to recover and threaten ships in the Red Sea again, as they have vowed. So far the response has been muted, with just a single anti-ship missile lobbed harmlessly into the Red Sea, far from any passing vessel, a Pentagon official told reporters earlier on Friday.
  But deeper American military involvement also adds to the perception in the larger world that the United States is acting even more directly on behalf of Israel, risking further damage to American and Western standing as the death toll rises in Gaza. Israel now is defending its conduct against the charge of genocide in an international court.
  Iran is using proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis to distance itself from their actions and maintain its credibility in the region, attempting to avoid a direct attack, which could put at risk the Islamic Revolution and its nuclear program.
  But Iran is also being pulled along by those very proxies.
  ''Iran is really pushing it,'' said François Heisbourg, a French military analyst. ''It's another reason they don't want a war now: They want their centrifuges to run peacefully.'' The Iranians do not have a nuclear weapon, but could enrich enough uranium to weapons grade in a few weeks, from the current 60 percent enrichment to 90 percent, he said. ''They've done 95 percent of the work.''
  Israel also is ratcheting up its attacks on Iran's proxies, especially in Lebanon and Syria. After the attack by Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon began a series of strikes from Lebanon, leading Israel to evacuate citizens near the conflict. 
  Following that, Israel's air campaign has killed 19 Hezbollah members in Syria in three months, more than twice the rest of 2023 combined, according to a count by Reuters news agency. More than 130 Hezbollah fighters have also been killed by Israel in Lebanon in the same period.
  Amine Hoteit, a retired Lebanese army general and analyst, listed several goals of the Israeli attacks in Syria: to keep attention there and to press the Syrian government ''to cut off the Iranian supply route.'' 
  U.S. troops deployed to Iraq and Syria to prevent a resurgence of ISIS have come under attack from Iran-backed militias 130 times since Oct. 17, according to the Pentagon's tally on Thursday, totaling 53 attacks in Iraq and 77 in Syria. The United States has retaliated on fewer than 10 occasions, usually after American casualties.
  Each time, the United States has said its response is meant to deter further attacks and is aimed at sending a message to Iran and its proxies, who operate freely in Iraq and Syria. But no American troops have been killed. The worry, according to U.S. officials, is that sooner or later, one of the attacks will kill troops, and then the response would be much more deadly and could spiral out of control.
  On Jan. 4, the U.S. military launched a rare retaliatory strike in Baghdad that killed a militia leader it blames for recent attacks on U.S. personnel, a move condemned by Iraq's government.
  While the Iraqi government is now dominated by parties close to Iran, the American presence has been tolerated largely because of the fear that without U.S. help, the Islamic State could quickly regain ground.
  But on Friday, Iraq's foreign ministry condemned the strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. ''We believe that expanding the scope of targets does not represent a solution to the problem -- rather, it will lead to an expansion of the scope of the war,'' the statement said.
  While the main attention has been on Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah, the Houthi threat to trade has the potential for the largest global impact, since some 30 percent of the world's container ships pass through the Red Sea. Already Volvo, Tesla and other carmakers in Europe have suspended production for a few days or more because of interruptions in receiving parts as ships route around the Red Sea and Suez Canal.
  The United States and more than a dozen other countries have created a coalition to protect shipping, Operation Prosperity Guardian. But the Houthis have continued to try to attack ships, with Israeli connections or not, and Maersk decided to pause all Red Sea shipping after a Dec. 31 attack on one of its ships. It has warned its customers to expect significant disruptions and analysts expect higher prices to add to global inflation.
  In public speeches this week, lran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah reiterated that they do not want an enlarged war. But Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism expert who is the director of research at the Soufan Group, said Israel could not afford to be complacent given its grave miscalculation before Oct. 7 that Hamas was also not interested in a war.
  Recent assassinations that struck at the heart of Iran's ties to Hezbollah and Hamas have unnerved Iranians who have described them in chat rooms and social media as being ''slapped over and over.''
  Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, killed on Christmas in Damascus, for two decades had been in charge of procuring missiles, rockets and drones for Hezbollah in Lebanon and allied militia groups in Syria and Iraq, according to Iranian media reports. Mr. Khamenei performed the prayer of the dead ritual above his body at his funeral, an honor reserved for the most revered underlings.
  Saleh al-Arouri, deputy political head of Hamas, killed in a drone strike in the heart of Hezbollah's power base in Dahieh district of Beirut, was the closest member of Hamas to Iran and Hezbollah and the person they trusted most with sensitive messaging and facilitating funding and technical know-how from Iran.

The American defense secretary reiterated “unshakable” support for Israeli security, but said protecting Palestinians was a “moral duty and a strategic imperative.”
Top United States officials prodded Israel on Monday to do more to protect civilians in the Gaza Strip and sought to restart talks aimed at releasing hostages as international pressure mounted on Israel to scale back its war against Hamas.
Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III, making his second trip to Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, declared that U.S. support for Israeli security “remains unshakable.” But he also said that “democracies are stronger and more secure when we uphold the law of war.”
“As I’ve said, protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza is both a moral duty and a strategic imperative,” Mr. Austin said at a news conference with Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant. “So we will continue to stand up for Israel’s bedrock right to defend itself. And we will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.”
Though Mr. Gallant said “there is no clock that is running,” he acknowledged that Israeli officials were discussing the next part of the conflict, as the Biden administration tries to persuade Israel to shift to more targeted operations after more than two months of heavy airstrikes.
“Soon, we will be able to distinguish between different areas in Gaza,” Mr. Gallant said. “In every area where we achieve our mission, we will be able to transition gradually to the next phase and start working on bringing back the local population.”
That could “be achieved maybe sooner in the north than in the south,” he said, adding that he was only trying to convey “an idea of what we are discussing.”
It is unclear what returning home might look like for Gazans. More than 60 percent of the housing units in the territory have been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations. The vast majority of Gaza’s 2.2 million residents have been displaced, with many packing into crowded shelters or living on the streets near the Egyptian border.
The Biden administration envisions Israel moving into a new phase of the war that would involve smaller groups of elite forces piercing in and out of population centers, conducting more precise missions to find and kill Hamas leaders, rescue the hostages seized in Israel on Oct. 7 and destroy the tunnels that the militants use to conceal their activities.
Mr. Austin appeared to allude to that strategy on Monday, saying he had shared with Israeli officials “thoughts about how to transition from high-intensity operations to lower-intensity and more surgical operations.”
U.S. officials say privately that President Biden wants Israel to switch to the more precise tactics in about three weeks. But Mr. Austin said, “This is Israel’s operation, and I’m not here to dictate timelines or terms.”
As Mr. Austin visited Israel, the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, met in Warsaw with Israeli and Qatari officials for talks aimed at restarting the hostage and prisoner exchanges that collapsed after a weeklong truce last month, according to U.S. officials.
Mr. Burns met with David Barnea, the head of Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, and with Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani of Qatar. The Qataris host Hamas’s political wing in Doha and have been facilitating the negotiations.
The talks came as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders are under growing domestic pressure to secure the release of the 129 hostages who are believed to remain in captivity, particularly after Israeli forces shot and killed three of them in Gaza last week.
The Israeli military said on Sunday that the hostages, all Israelis, had tried to use leftover food to create signs calling for help. The men emerged shirtless from a building, carrying a makeshift white flag, and tried to tell approaching Israeli soldiers in Hebrew that they were civilians, the military said.
The deaths have created widespread anguish in Israel, and prompted renewed calls for a pause in the fighting to allow more hostages to be released. On Monday, Hamas released the first video of hostages since the exchange agreement collapsed.
The video showed three men, bearded and seated. One of them speaks to the camera and identifies himself as a 79-year-old from the Nir Oz kibbutz, where Hamas militants kidnapped more than 70 people. The video includes subtitles in English that do not directly correspond to the Hebrew words used by the hostage, who pleads for the release of the captives.
The Israeli government and military have dismissed such videos as “psychological warfare.”
At the United Nations on Monday, the Security Council pushed back by a day a vote on a resolution calling for more humanitarian aid routes into Gaza by air, land and sea. The resolution also calls for the immediate release of the hostages and a sustainable halt to the fighting. The United States has vetoed past resolutions calling for an immediate, permanent cease-fire.
Concern has also been growing about Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen launching drone and missile attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea, a vital shipping lane that has become increasingly dangerous. Over the weekend, Britain and the United States said their militaries had shot down more than a dozen drones in the area.
On Monday, Mr. Austin said, “Iran’s support for Houthi attacks on commercial vessels must stop.”
Soon after, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a senior member of the Houthis, defended the attacks as an effort to force Israel to stop its military assault in Gaza. The United States, he said, has “no right to speak about international law, which your airstrikes and rockets have torn up and buried under the ruins of Gaza and Yemen.”
The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people. About 240 people were taken hostage. Health officials in Gaza say nearly 20,000 people have been killed in the Israeli response.
The high death toll in Gaza, Pentagon officials say, may be attributable in part to Israel’s broad use of unguided air-to-ground munitions, which account for nearly half of the airstrikes.  Even the precision-guided munitions that the United States military used in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan produced many civilian casualties, but unguided munitions — so-called dumb bombs — pose an even greater threat, analysts say.
Human Rights Watch went a step further, accusing Israel on Monday of starving civilians by blocking deliveries of food, water and fuel. The group said Israel’s actions could constitute a war crime. It cited statements by senior Israeli leaders to support its claim that depriving Gazans of necessities was a policy put in place by Israeli armed forces.
An Israeli government spokesman, Eylon Levy, rejected the report as “a lie.”
“We’re still pumping water into Gaza through two pipelines and have placed no restrictions on entry of food and water,” he said.
Mr. Gallant, the defense minister, also strongly defended the conduct of the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza.
“Unlike our enemies, we are defending our values, and we operate according to international law,” he said. “The I.D.F. is operating to minimize the harm to civilian populations. We are also working with international partners to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid.”

With the U.S.-led attacks in Yemen, there is no longer a question of whether the Israel-Hamas war will escalate into a wider conflict. The question is whether it can be contained.
From the outbreak of the Israeli-Hamas war nearly 100 days ago, President Biden and his aides have struggled to keep the war contained, fearful that a regional escalation could quickly draw in American forces.
Now, with the American-led strike on nearly 30 sites in Yemen on Thursday and a smaller strike the next day, there is no longer a question of whether there will be a regional conflict. It has already begun. The biggest questions now are the conflict’s intensity and whether it can be contained.
This is exactly the outcome no one wanted, presumably including Iran.
“We’re not interested in a war with Yemen. We’re not interested in a conflict of any kind,” John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, said on Friday. “In fact, everything the president has been doing has been trying to prevent any escalation of conflict, including the strikes last night.”
Mr. Biden’s decision to unleash airstrikes, after resisting calls to act against the Yemen-based Houthi militants whose repeated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea were beginning to take a toll on global commerce, is a clear shift in strategy. After issuing a series of warnings, officials said, Mr. Biden felt his hand was forced after a barrage of missile and drone attacks on Tuesday were directed at an American cargo ship and the Navy vessels around it.
“This is already a regional war, no longer limited to Gaza, but already spread to Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen,” said Hugh Lovatt, a Mideast expert for the European Council on Foreign Relations. Washington, he added, wanted to demonstrate that it was ready to deter Iranian provocations, so it conspicuously placed its aircraft carriers and fighters in position to respond quickly. But those same positions leave the United States more exposed.
Over the course of 12 weeks, attacks on Israeli, American and Western interests have come from Lebanon, Iraq and Syria, prompting modest, carefully targeted responses from American and Israeli forces. The United States also issued warnings to Iran, which the Americans say is acting as a loose coordinator.
What was notable about the retaliatory strike in Yemen was its breadth: Employing fighter jets and sea-launched missiles, U.S. and British forces, backed up by a small number of other allies, hit a wide number of Houthi missile and drone sites.
Mr. Biden is walking the fine line between deterrence and escalation, and his aides concede there is no science to the calculation. Tehran and its allies, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, have been careful in their support for Hamas, keeping their actions within limits, to prevent a larger American military response that could threaten Tehran’s exercise of power in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria.
But how much control Iran has over its proxies is in question, and its leaders may also be misreading American and Israeli red lines.
The Houthis, a small Iranian-backed tribe in Yemen, have been among the most aggressive in pushing the envelope, trying to block international trading routes through the Red Sea and ignoring American and Western warnings to desist.
Houthi officials say that the sole goal of their attacks is to force Israel to halt its military campaign and to allow the free flow of aid into Gaza.
Western diplomats said that there had been reluctance to strike back at the Houthis, in part to avoid upending a truce in the Yemeni civil war, and in part because of the difficulty of eliminating their threat entirely. But the Houthis’ repeated attacks on ships, their direct fire on American helicopters, and their attack Tuesday on an American cargo vessel, left the United States with what officials said was no real choice. 
U.S. officials said the Pentagon carried out a second round of strikes on Friday against the Houthis, bombing a radar facility in Yemen.
It is not known how long it will take the Houthis to recover and threaten ships in the Red Sea again, as they have vowed. So far the response has been muted, with just a single anti-ship missile lobbed harmlessly into the Red Sea, far from any passing vessel, a Pentagon official told reporters earlier on Friday.
But deeper American military involvement also adds to the perception in the larger world that the United States is acting even more directly on behalf of Israel, risking further damage to American and Western standing as the death toll rises in Gaza. Israel now is defending its conduct against the charge of genocide in an international court.
Iran is using proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis to distance itself from their actions and maintain its credibility in the region, attempting to avoid a direct attack, which could put at risk the Islamic Revolution and its nuclear program.
But Iran is also being pulled along by those very proxies.
“Iran is really pushing it,” said François Heisbourg, a French military analyst. “It’s another reason they don’t want a war now: They want their centrifuges to run peacefully.” The Iranians do not have a nuclear weapon, but could enrich enough uranium to weapons grade in a few weeks, from the current 60 percent enrichment to 90 percent, he said. “They’ve done 95 percent of the work.”
Israel also is ratcheting up its attacks on Iran’s proxies, especially in Lebanon and Syria. After the attack by Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon began a series of strikes from Lebanon, leading Israel to evacuate citizens near the conflict. 
Following that, Israel’s air campaign has killed 19 Hezbollah members in Syria in three months, more than twice the rest of 2023 combined, according to a count by Reuters news agency. More than 130 Hezbollah fighters have also been killed by Israel in Lebanon in the same period.
Amine Hoteit, a retired Lebanese army general and analyst, listed several goals of the Israeli attacks in Syria: to keep attention there and to press the Syrian government “to cut off the Iranian supply route.” 
U.S. troops deployed to Iraq and Syria to prevent a resurgence of ISIS have come under attack from Iran-backed militias 130 times since Oct. 17, according to the Pentagon’s tally on Thursday, totaling 53 attacks in Iraq and 77 in Syria. The United States has retaliated on fewer than 10 occasions, usually after American casualties.
Each time, the United States has said its response is meant to deter further attacks and is aimed at sending a message to Iran and its proxies, who operate freely in Iraq and Syria. But no American troops have been killed. The worry, according to U.S. officials, is that sooner or later, one of the attacks will kill troops, and then the response would be much more deadly and could spiral out of control.
On Jan. 4, the U.S. military launched a rare retaliatory strike in Baghdad that killed a militia leader it blames for recent attacks on U.S. personnel, a move condemned by Iraq’s government.
While the Iraqi government is now dominated by parties close to Iran, the American presence has been tolerated largely because of the fear that without U.S. help, the Islamic State could quickly regain ground.
But on Friday, Iraq’s foreign ministry condemned the strikes on the Houthis in Yemen. “We believe that expanding the scope of targets does not represent a solution to the problem — rather, it will lead to an expansion of the scope of the war,” the statement said.
While the main attention has been on Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah, the Houthi threat to trade has the potential for the largest global impact, since some 30 percent of the world’s container ships pass through the Red Sea. Already Volvo, Tesla and other carmakers in Europe have suspended production for a few days or more because of interruptions in receiving parts as ships route around the Red Sea and Suez Canal.
The United States and more than a dozen other countries have created a coalition to protect shipping, Operation Prosperity Guardian. But the Houthis have continued to try to attack ships, with Israeli connections or not, and Maersk decided to pause all Red Sea shipping after a Dec. 31 attack on one of its ships. It has warned its customers to expect significant disruptions and analysts expect higher prices to add to global inflation.
In public speeches this week, lran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah reiterated that they do not want an enlarged war. But Colin P. Clarke, a counterterrorism expert who is the director of research at the Soufan Group, said Israel could not afford to be complacent given its grave miscalculation before Oct. 7 that Hamas was also not interested in a war.
Recent assassinations that struck at the heart of Iran’s ties to Hezbollah and Hamas have unnerved Iranians who have described them in chat rooms and social media as being “slapped over and over.”
Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi, killed on Christmas in Damascus, for two decades had been in charge of procuring missiles, rockets and drones for Hezbollah in Lebanon and allied militia groups in Syria and Iraq, according to Iranian media reports. Mr. Khamenei performed the prayer of the dead ritual above his body at his funeral, an honor reserved for the most revered underlings.
Saleh al-Arouri, deputy political head of Hamas, killed in a drone strike in the heart of Hezbollah’s power base in Dahieh district of Beirut, was the closest member of Hamas to Iran and Hezbollah and the person they trusted most with sensitive messaging and facilitating funding and technical know-how from Iran.

Highlight: A Lebanese security official said the commander was part of the group’s Radwan unit, which Israel says aims to infiltrate its northern border.
Body


Hezbollah said on Monday that one of its commanders had been killed in a strike in southern Lebanon, adding to concerns that Israel’s fight against Hamas in Gaza could erupt into a wider regional war.
The killing of the commander, identified by Hezbollah as Wissam Hassan al-Tawil, came as Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited troops near the border with Lebanon and vowed that Israel “will do everything to restore security to the north,” according to his office.
Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, and Israel have traded increasingly intense and deadly cross-border fire since the Israel-Hamas war began three months ago, eliciting Israeli warnings of a full-scale war. Six days ago, a strike in Beirut — attributed, like the one on Monday, to Israel — killed a top Hamas official who was a liaison to Hezbollah and to the two groups’ mutual patron, Iran.
The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, is visiting leaders in the Middle East this week on a trip aimed at preventing the fighting from expanding along other fronts. He arrived in Tel Aviv on Monday night. 
A Lebanese security official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said that Mr. al-Tawil was a commander in Hezbollah’s Radwan unit, which Israel says aims to infiltrate its northern border. The official said that Mr. al-Tawil had been killed in an Israeli strike in Khirbet Selm, a village in southern Lebanon that is about nine miles from the Israeli border.
The Israeli military did not directly comment on the attack. In a statement, it said that an Israeli fighter jet had carried out “a series of strikes,” hitting a Hezbollah military site, without giving further details.
Mr. al-Tawil’s role in Hezbollah was not immediately clear. But in an apparent effort to signal his seniority, Al Manar, a Hezbollah-owned Lebanese broadcaster, and media controlled by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, posted images of him alongside various high-ranking Hezbollah officials including the group’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, as well as with Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian general who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2020.
A day earlier, the Israeli military said that it had killed at least seven members of Hezbollah in strikes aimed at destroying the Radwan unit and that it was ready to attack more of Hezbollah’s positions. The Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzl Halevi, said that its forces were determined to keep pressure on Hezbollah and that if those efforts fell short, Israel was ready to fight “another war.”
“We will create a completely different reality, or we will get to another war,” he said on Sunday.
Hezbollah attacks damaged an Israeli military base on Saturday, one of the group’s biggest assaults against Israel in months of back-and-forth strikes across the border. The powerful Lebanese militia has pledged support for Hamas, and in recent days, it has stepped up assaults on Israel in response to the killing last week of Saleh al-Arouri a senior Hamas leader, outside of Beirut.
The rocket fire on the base, the Northern Air Control Unit on Mount Meron, left it with significant damage, according to accounts in the Israeli news media, but the facility is still operating “and has been reinforced with additional systems,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s chief spokesman, said on Sunday.
The clashes have added to concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could grow into a wider regional conflict, and have forced tens of thousands of people on each side of the Israel-Lebanon border to evacuate their communities. In solidarity with Hamas, the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen has attacked ships in the Red Sea and launched missiles at Israel. The United States has struck targets in Iraq, while Israel is presumed to have carried out targeted assassinations in Syria and Lebanon.
Israeli leaders have repeatedly declared in recent weeks that there are only two options for restoring calm in the conflict with Hezbollah: a diplomatic solution that would move the Radwan forces farther from the border, north of the Litani River; or, failing that, a major Israeli military offensive aimed at achieving the same goal.
Calm, they say, is a prerequisite for about 80,000 Israelis who have been evacuated from the area to be able to return to their homes. A similar number of Lebanese have fled their homes on the other side of the border.
“Hezbollah is dragging Lebanon into a totally unnecessary war,” Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, told reporters on Monday.
“We are now at a fork in the road,” he added. “Either Hezbollah backs off, hopefully as part of a diplomatic solution, or we will push it away.”
The Biden administration has been calling for an agreement that would move Hezbollah forces away from the border, but with little apparent progress. Although Israeli officials have said that time for a diplomatic deal is running out, analysts say that Israel is wary of significantly expanding the conflict with Hezbollah while the military is still engaged in intensive fighting in Gaza.

More than 90 percent of Palestinians in the territory say they have regularly gone without food for a whole day, according to the United Nations.
Walaa Zaiter’s four children have been hungry for weeks, but she can barely find them food.
They ask for sandwiches, fruit juice and homemade Palestinian dishes like she used to cook before the war began. In a fleeting moment of internet access, she said, she once caught the children huddled around her phone to watch a YouTube video of someone eating French fries.
The most they can hope for these days, she said in a recent telephone interview, is a can of peas, some cheese and an energy bar distributed as a family’s rations by the United Nations once a week in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where they fled to in early December to escape Israeli bombardment farther north. It is not nearly enough to feed her family of seven.
“It’s a daily struggle,” said Ms. Zaiter, 37, whose children range in age from 9 months to 13 years. “You feel you are under pressure and hopeless, and you cannot provide anything.”
Israel’s war in Gaza has created a humanitarian catastrophe, with half of the population of about 2.2 million at risk of starvation and 90 percent saying that they regularly go without food for a whole day, the United Nations said in a recent report.
Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Program, said the humanitarian disaster in Gaza was among the worst he had ever seen. The territory appears to meet at least the first criteria of a famine, with 20 percent of the population facing an extreme lack of food, he said.
“I’ve been doing this for about 20 years,” Mr. Husain said. “I’ve been to pretty much any conflict, whether Yemen, whether it was South Sudan, northeast Nigeria, Ethiopia, you name it. And I have never seen anything like this, both in terms of its scale, its magnitude, but also at the pace that this has unfolded.”
Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, contended that Israel did not stand in the way of humanitarian assistance and blamed Hamas, the Palestinian group that rules Gaza, for any shortages. He accused Hamas of seizing some of the aid for its own uses. He did not provide evidence, but Western and Arab officials have said that Hamas is known to have a large stockpile of supplies, including food, fuel and medicine.
The war began on Oct. 7 after Hamas attacked Israel and killed an estimated 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. To retaliate, Israel launched a devastating air bombardment of the small, impoverished enclave, followed by a ground invasion that has displaced roughly 85 percent of the population.
More than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and it has destroyed much of the territory’s civilian infrastructure and economy. Israel has also imposed a siege on Gaza for months now, cutting off most water, food, fuel and medicine.
Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations agency that aids Palestinians, said he recently saw desperately hungry Gazans stop the organization’s aid trucks in Rafah, raid their food supplies and devour them on the spot.
“I witnessed this firsthand,” he told a news conference in Geneva two days after visiting Rafah at the southern end of Gaza. “Everywhere you go, people are hungry, desperate and terrified.”
Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of collectively punishing Gaza civilians for the actions of Hamas and of “using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.” Both are potential war crimes.
“For over two months, Israel has been depriving Gaza’s population of food and water, a policy spurred on or endorsed by high-ranking Israeli officials and reflecting an intent to starve civilians as a method of warfare,” said Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch.
“World leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime, which has devastating effects on Gaza’s population,” he said.
At the beginning of the war, Israeli officials vowed to deny humanitarian aid to Gaza.
“I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip: There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Oct. 9. “We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly.”
Nothing was allowed in for the first two weeks. Then some deliveries began to flow, but no fuel was allowed in until Nov. 18.
In recent weeks, Israel has allowed 100 to 120 trucks to enter Gaza each day, said Dr. Guillemette Thomas, a Jerusalem-based medical coordinator for Doctors Without Borders. That is still far less than the 500 trucks that entered each day before the war, and far below what is needed, she said.
Mr. Levy, the government spokesman, pushed back recently against the idea that Israel was preventing or slowing the flow of aid.
“We categorically reject the despicable and libelous allegations that Israel is somehow obstructing the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” he said on Dec. 20.
“If they want more food and water to reach Gaza, they should send more food and water to Gaza,” he added, referring to international aid groups. “And while they’re sending more aid, they should condemn Hamas for hijacking aid deliveries and diverting them to its fighters. Their silence is shameful. We will not accept international officials deflecting blame onto us to cover up the fact they’re covering up for Hamas.”
But Mr. Lazzarini said on Friday that it was “baseless misinformation” to blame the international community for the lack of aid into Gaza. He said deliveries were “limited in quantities and riddled with logistical hurdles” imposed by Israel.
Those include a complicated and lengthy verification process, a ban on the delivery of commercial goods to markets and private businesses, and restricted access to much of Gaza, either because of airstrikes, fighting or Israeli military checkpoints.
Gaza spiraled so quickly into humanitarian catastrophe when the war began because it had already been deep in crisis for many years.
Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on the territory after Hamas seized power in 2007, largely cutting off Gaza’s economic activity with the outside world. The blockade made up to 80 percent of Gazans reliant on humanitarian aid even before the war, the United Nations said.
Azmi Keshawi, an analyst for the research organization International Crisis Group, said that even if Israel says it does not view its war as one against Gaza’s population, it is civilians who are paying the heaviest price.
“Our daily nightmare is to go hunt for food,” said Mr. Keshawi, who fled his home in Gaza City in the north and now lives in a tent on a sidewalk in Rafah with his children. One of his children was injured by an Israeli airstrike, he said.
“You cannot find flour,” he said. “You cannot find yeast to make bread. You cannot find any kind of food — tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, lemon, orange juice.”
When food can be found for sale, he said, the prices have skyrocketed. In Rafah, a sack of flour that might have cost $13 before the war now sells for $138 to $165.
Thousands of displaced people who fled to Rafah, one of the few so-called safe zones in Gaza today, now struggle to pay for a can of tuna, which once cost less than 30 cents and is now more than $1.50, or a can of corned beef, which once cost about $1.40 but now is more than $5.50, he said.
“These people left home with no money,” Mr. Keshawi said. “Surviving becomes a challenge.”
Tahrir Muqat, 46, said she had fled her home in Gaza City and now lived with four relatives, including a baby, in a school in Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza. There is virtually no regular running water, and on the rare occasions when it does turn on, people stockpile it in the toilet bowl and drink from that, she said.
She waits in line for hours each day to get two packs of feta cheese and three crackers from aid workers at a shelter. Then she and her relatives go from door to door, begging for scraps at ruined houses crammed with displaced people.
“Most of the time we get a ‘No!’ with insulting comments like ‘Go back to Gaza City! Everything has become too expensive since you arrived!’” Ms. Muqat said.
She said she had once seen children eating rotten tomatoes that they had found in the street.
Last month, she said, an airstrike hit nearby while they were begging. Her daughter, Nasayem, in her mid-20s, was sprayed with shrapnel in her leg, arm, chest and back. There is scant medicine to treat her and no heat in their shelter to cut the winter chill. And the injury has made her more exhausted and listless. But Nasayem is focused on protecting her baby, her mother said.
“When it is cold, it hurts her more,” Ms. Muqat said of her daughter last week. “She fell asleep early today and said she would go out tomorrow morning to look for food for her baby,” she added. “She has to.”

Also, a recap of the Golden Globes.
Israel said it was shifting its war in Gaza
Israel has begun a new and less intense phase of its invasion of Gaza, its military said, after weeks of pressure to scale back its offensive. But its chief of staff said that the country was ready for “another war” against Hezbollah, which said a commander was killed in a strike in Lebanon.
The Israeli military’s top spokesman said the new phase would involve fewer airstrikes and ground troops in Gaza after a drawdown began this month. He said Israel would now focus on Hamas’s southern and central strongholds.
“We can expect more targeted operations rather than wide maneuvers,” Patrick Kingsley, our Jerusalem bureau chief, told us. “Whether that alleviates civilian suffering remains to be seen: The strikes are clearly still continuing, killing scores every day, and more than 80 percent of Gazans are displaced, many of them with no home to return to.”
The killing of the Hezbollah commander, Wissam Hassan al-Tawil, came a day after Israel said that it had killed at least seven Hezbollah members in the Radwan unit, which Israel says aims to infiltrate its northern border. A Lebanese official said al-Tawil was in that unit.
Lebanon: Hezbollah attacks damaged an Israeli military base on Saturday, one of the group’s biggest assaults in months. The Biden administration has been calling for an agreement that would move Hezbollah forces away from the border.
Diplomacy: Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, arrived in Israel yesterday for talks aimed at preventing the conflict from escalating into a broader regional war.
A ruling will allow Sharif to run again
Pakistan’s Supreme Court overturned a law that barred politicians with past convictions from seeking political office. The move paves the way for a former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, to run in elections on Feb. 8.
Sharif, a three-time former prime minister, was disqualified from running for office for life in 2017. He never finished out any of his terms, having been toppled either by corruption allegations or a military coup. He left for London in 2019 but returned in October to revive his political career.
Context: Pakistan has been reeling from a political and economic crisis since April 2022, when former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is in jail but remains widely popular, was ousted by a parliamentary vote of no confidence after losing the support of the military establishment.
A rocket to challenge SpaceX
The Vulcan Centaur rocket lifted off early yesterday morning from Cape Canaveral, Fla., sending a robotic spacecraft toward the moon. The rocket launched successfully, but a spacecraft it carried malfunctioned and likely will not be able to land on the lunar surface.
The Vulcan was built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which could challenge the primacy of SpaceX.
It also carried a secondary payload for Celestis, a company that sends people’s ashes or DNA into space. Among those whose remains are on this journey is Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek. Samples of hair from three American presidents are also onboard.
THE LATEST NEWS
Around the World
India’s top court restored life sentences for 11 Hindu men who were convicted of gang-raping a Muslim woman during Hindu-Muslim mob violence in 2002.
China said it had detained a foreign consultant that it accused of spying for Britain.
TikTok quietly curtailed a tool used to measure popularity after results were used to scrutinize content related to geopolitics and the Israel-Hamas war.
Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne of France resigned ahead of a widely expected cabinet reshuffle by President Emmanuel Macron.
Ukraine has shifted almost entirely into a defensive mode. Its soldiers say that operating near the front line is more dangerous than ever.
Other Big Stories
An Alaska Airlines plane, which lost part of its fuselage on Friday, had previously been restricted from long flights over water.
Pope Francis called surrogate motherhood “despicable,” urging a universal ban.
A.I. chatbots are set to advance rapidly this year. They may expand beyond text and start to behave more like humans.
After years of mystery, a data analyst cracked a code hidden in a secret pocket of a dress from the 1800s.
A Morning Read
She had no next of kin, no funeral and no further instructions: She simply asked that her ashes be interred at Hartsdale Pet Cemetery, north of New York City.
But who was this woman who had died more than 2,000 miles away? And why would she be laid to rest at a pet cemetery, all alone?
Lives lived: Franz Beckenbauer, a towering figure in soccer who led West Germany to World Cup championships as a player in 1974 and as coach in 1990, has died at 78.
ARTS AND IDEAS
The highs and the lows of the Golden Globes
“Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster biopic, all but swept the Golden Globes. The film won five trophies — best drama, director, actor, supporting actor and score. (“Barbie,” its box office twin, was the most nominated film, and won in the rather meaningless category of best blockbuster.)
But the prizes were only part of the show. In our recap of highs and lows: Jo Koy’s widely panned monologue, a surprise upset for best screenplay and Steven Yeun’s entertaining speech. Check out these glamorous backstage portraits of the winners.
As for the red carpet: Stars wore ball gowns, sequins and lots of red. Here’s a selection of those who stood out above the rest.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Mix: A pungent chile sauce kicks up this nutritious vegetarian grain bowl.
Listen: Questlove made a playlist for our 6-day Energy Challenge.
Travel: Enjoy a decadent Swiss breakfast and visit a jazz bar in Zurich.
Read: Try an underappreciated murder mystery by Winnie-the-Pooh’s creator.

Body


The threat of a regional war.
Tensions are escalating in the Middle East
The Middle East is coming closer to the brink of a regional war, which the Biden administration has tried to stave off since Hamas’s deadly attacks against Israel on Oct. 7. Growing attacks have forced thousands from their homes at the border between Lebanon and Israel, while Israeli forces continue to pummel the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. See the latest updates.
In Lebanon, the killing of a Hamas leader in Beirut is raising fears of a wider conflict at the country’s border with Israel. Many southern villages have already emptied out as clashes between Israel and Hezbollah intensify. Israel has evacuated more than 80,000 people on its side of the border.
In southern Gaza, Israel’s military pressed on with its bombardment of areas that it has told civilians to evacuate to amid fierce fighting, Palestine Red Crescent and Gazan officials said. Dozens of people have died in the last three days, according to the Gazan officials. The U.N. said that Israel’s attacks had left nowhere for residents to seek shelter from the bombing.
Other news:
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombings that killed 84 people in Kerman, Iran.
Attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea by the Houthi rebels in Yemen have left oil tanker operators balancing the risks with losing business.
A U.S. drone strike in Baghdad killed a top leader in a militant group linked to Iran. The Iraqi government condemned the attack.
A top adviser at the Education Department has resigned over President Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, the second official to do so.
Trump’s endorsement playbook
As of this week, every member of the House Republican leadership is formally backing Donald Trump’s campaign to recapture the White House. Trump pockets his endorsements through both fear and favor, cajoling fellow politicians by phone while firing off ominous social media posts about those who don’t fall in line.
The former president has a particular focus on gathering these formal endorsements. In recent weeks, his allies have told lawmakers that Trump will be closely watching who has and hasn’t endorsed him before the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15.
Test case: In October, Trump felled a top candidate for House speaker, Representative Tom Emmer, by posting that voting for him “would be a tragic mistake!” On Wednesday, Emmer capitulated and endorsed him.
‘An admission’: Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, said in a new ad that he had been wrong to endorse Trump in 2016. “I did it because I thought I could make him a better candidate and a better president,” he said. “Well, I was wrong. I made a mistake.”
Overseas transactions: Trump’s businesses received at least $7.8 million from foreign governments during his presidency, a new report by House Democrats found.
Evidence has grown that Russia controls Marinka
The Ukrainian military said yesterday that its troops were fighting “in the vicinities” of a village behind the eastern frontline town of Marinka. The town’s capture would be Russia’s most significant territorial advance since the fall of Bakhmut in May.
While its control is unlikely to turn the tide of the war, the loss of Marinka would be further evidence that Moscow has firmly seized the initiative on the battlefield after Ukraine’s summer counteroffensive stalled.
THE LATEST NEWS
Around the World
South Korea’s intelligence agency said that Kim Ju-ae, the daughter of Kim Jong-un, “is seen as the most likely successor” to be North Korea’s leader.
The French supermarket chain Carrefour dropped PepsiCo products like Doritos, accusing the company of “unacceptably” high prices despite falling inflation.

A surge in sightings of balloons from China flying over Taiwan has drawn the attention of the island’s military and struck some experts as a calculatedly ambiguous warning.
Covid deaths in the U.S. have risen to about 1,500 per week, and researchers are questioning why use of the medicine Paxlovid has remained low.

A Morning Read
A library in a small mountain town in New York announced a one-time addition to its children’s lineup: Drag Queen Story Hour. Pandemonium broke loose — within months, someone had called in a bomb threat, a board meeting ended in thrown punches and a librarian was hospitalized with stress-induced vertigo.
The event never happened, but the library has now been closed for more than three months for the first time in its 53 years of operation.

ARTS AND IDEAS 
An oligarch v. Sotheby’s
In a trial set for next week, Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch, plans to take on the auction house Sotheby’s, a giant of the art world. Rybolovlev claims that the company helped a dealer to trick him into overpaying by millions for works like Leonardo da Vinci’s “Salvator Mundi.”
Sotheby’s denies all wrongdoing. But whatever the trial’s result, it is expected to provide a rare window into the inner, often secretive workings of the art trade, where even buyers seldom know from whom they are purchasing art — or how much it is truly worth.
“This case is the granddaddy of them all,” said Nicholas O’Donnell, an art market lawyer, “when it comes to what do we do in the art market in terms of conflicting loyalties and transparency.”

The United States finds itself in a defensive crouch and at odds with even staunch allies like France, Canada, Australia and Japan.
Days of intense negotiations enabled the Biden administration to avoid casting a veto at the United Nations Security Council in defense of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. 
  But abstaining from a resolution designed to help more humanitarian aid reach Gaza only limited the damage to America's standing around the world as it becomes an increasingly lonely protector of Israel.
  The outcome was a relief to U.S. officials loath to exercise America's veto power in defense of Israel for what would have been the third time since Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks. Abstaining from a 13-0 vote may look better than casting a veto -- which President Biden has said should be reserved for ''rare, extraordinary situations'' -- but it still may not help America's image abroad.
  It is one reason, with the year drawing to a close, that the United States finds itself diplomatically isolated and in a defensive crouch.
  That isolation is a dramatic turnaround in international perceptions for the Biden administration: For most of the past two years, top U.S. officials led what they saw as a valiant crusade to rally the world against Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken were praised at home and abroad for uniting allies under the banner of American leadership as they invoked basic principles of international law and human rights.
  ''Putin's invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world,'' Mr. Biden boasted in February in his State of the Union address. ''Together, we did what America always does at our best. We led. We united NATO and built a global coalition.''
  Today, as the United States guards Israel's interests at the United Nations, endorses its goal of destroying Hamas and provides its munitions, much of the world sees the Biden administration as enabling an indefensibly lethal Israeli military campaign, which President Biden himself has referred to as ''indiscriminate bombing.''
  Coalition building on behalf of Ukraine has turned to crisis management over Gaza. The United States is now at odds with staunch allies like France, Canada, Australia and Japan, all of whom voted earlier this month for a resolution calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. The United States vetoed that resolution, on the grounds that any cease-fire would allow Hamas to regroup and attack Israel again.
  Human rights groups -- which for months applauded U.S. efforts to hold Russia accountable -- now denounce the United States for supporting Israel, which many of them accuse of committing war crimes in Gaza.
  Israel blames Hamas for embedding itself among civilians and says it takes unusual steps to mitigate civilian casualties. The health ministry in Gaza says the death toll there is more than 20,000, although it is not known how many of those are civilians.
  Senior Biden officials who found a clear sense of purpose in the project of uniting Europe against Russia privately admit that the past weeks have been difficult as the U.S. supplies and defends an Israeli campaign that has led to so much suffering and global outrage. ''The last couple of months have been gut-wrenching when you see the suffering of men, women and especially children in Gaza,'' Mr. Blinken said at a news conference on Wednesday.
  ''No U.S. official right now likes this situation,'' said Richard Gowan, an expert on the United Nations for International Crisis Group, a conflict prevention organization.
  Adding to the anxiety is the fact that bad blood toward Washington over its role in the Gaza conflict could complicate other diplomatic goals for the United States, at least in the near term.
  ''We are isolated,'' said Barbara Bodine, a former career diplomat and ambassador who is now the director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University. She warned that the United States has lost the global good will it had earned from its response to Russia's aggression. ''For too many friends and allies, it just stood in such stark contrast to our response to Ukraine,'' she said.
  Biden officials firmly deny that any contradiction exists between their confrontation of Russia and their defense of Israel. In each case, officials say, they are standing up for the victim of a brutal and unprovoked attack. Mr. Blinken often cites Israel's ''right to defend itself,'' a phrase he has also applied to Ukraine. He has also said separately that Russia's invasion and the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks were moments for ''moral clarity'' around the world.
  It is not the first time that the United States has appeared isolated in its defense of Israel, especially at the United Nations, where successive American administrations often have swatted back what they see as reflexive anti-Israel sentiment. In remarks explaining the U.S. vote on Friday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, noted that the Security Council has yet to condemn the original Hamas attacks.
  In a sign of how important the Friday vote was to the Biden administration, Mr. Blinken assumed an unusually large role in the negotiations even as Ms. Thomas-Greenfield pressed her U.N. colleagues. A senior administration official said that Mr. Blinken worked the phones with numerous Arab officials, including three calls each with the foreign ministers of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
  ''It took many days and many, many long nights of negotiating to get this right,'' Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said, praising the resolution for offering ''a glimmer of hope amongst a sea of unimaginable suffering'' by creating a U.N. coordinator for Gaza aid.
  Asked about American isolation on Wednesday, Mr. Blinken betrayed no concern, saying that the United States continues to ''rally countries around the world'' to support Ukraine, has cultivated partnerships to strengthen the U.S. position against China, and is leading global efforts on food insecurity, artificial intelligence and clean energy.
  When it comes to Israel and Gaza, he said, ''countries throughout the region, as well as countries around the world, want to work with us and are looking for American leadership in this crisis -- even countries that may disagree with us on certain issues that have come to the fore.''
  But much of the world sees things differently -- especially, Ms. Bodine said, countries in the so-called ''global south'' that are not closely aligned with any major powers like the United States, China or Russia. Many of those countries, including South Africa and India, never saw the U.S. emphasis on Ukraine in the heroic terms that much of Europe did, Ms. Bodine said.
  ''Much of the global south did not feel that their conflicts and problems garnered the same level of concern and action,'' she said. Then, when Mr. Biden and other U.S. officials seemed to greenlight a massive Israeli military response to Oct. 7 ''without guardrails,'' she added, it ''painfully confirmed to many in the south this sense that there was a double standard.''
  Bad blood over Gaza would make it harder to win support from those countries, in particular for pro-Ukraine resolutions, Mr. Gowan of Crisis Group warned.
  That is great news for the Russian government.
  ''The Russians have been reveling in this moment and they have used every possible opportunity to talk about U.S. double standards,'' Mr. Gowan said. ''At the end of the day the Russian strategy works, because beyond the United Nations what everyone sees is Russia standing up for international law -- and the U.S. standing against it.''
  Speaking at the United Nations in September of last year, Mr. Biden said that members of the United Nations Security Council should cast vetoes only under ''rare, extraordinary situations to ensure the council remains credible and effective.'' At the time, Russia had cast seven veto votes since the beginning of his presidency.
  The United States is still far from that tally. But it was surely on the minds of Biden administration officials as they scrambled to avoid their third veto related to Gaza in as many months.
  That outcome, Ms. Bodine said, ''would have been devastating.''

Preview: Also, violence in Ecuador.
The U.S. weighs retaliation after Houthi attacks
The U.S. and its allies are trying to figure out how to stop attacks by Houthi rebels based in Yemen against commercial ships in the Red Sea. This comes after American and British forces said yesterday that they intercepted one of the largest barrages of missiles and drones yet.
Here’s the latest.
Iran backs the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The attacks, which are in solidarity with Hamas in its war against Israel, have forced major shipping companies to reroute vessels away from the Red Sea, a major shipping corridor. They have created delays and led to higher prices for oil and other goods.
The Biden administration has said it will hold the Houthis responsible for the attacks. That warning suggested the U.S. might be considering retaliatory strikes on Houthi territory in Yemen, officials said.  Britain said it was also considering taking military action if the attacks didn’t stop.
A Houthi spokesman said Tuesday’s attack was in response to an assault by the U.S. Navy from 10 days ago that sank three Houthi boats, killing their crew members. He added that the group would continue the attacks “until the aggression stops and the siege on our steadfast brothers in Gaza is lifted.”
The future: Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, spoke with Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, about the role the group might play in Gaza after the war. Behind the scenes, Arab countries are building consensus about a “day after” scenario.
Legal action: The International Court of Justice will begin hearings this week in a case brought by South Africa that accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.
A state of emergency in Ecuador
President Daniel Noboa of Ecuador declared a 60-day state of emergency amid a wave of violence that followed a top gang leader’s disappearance from prison. Noboa imposed a nationwide curfew and authorized the military to patrol the streets and take control of prisons.
Explosions, looting and gunfire have been reported, along with uprisings in several prisons. Gunmen stormed a TV studio during a live broadcast. Noboa declared that an internal armed conflict was underway and ordered the military to “neutralize” two dozen gangs, which he said were terrorist organizations.
Background: Adolfo Macías, or “Fito,” had been running the Los Choneros gang from behind bars. The government recently ordered that high-profile convicts be transferred to a maximum-security facility, which could have prompted his escape and led to the uprisings. Some experts believe that gangs control up to a quarter of Ecuador’s prisons.
The attacker in Seoul intended to stop a presidential bid
The man who last week stabbed Lee Jae-myung, South Korea’s top opposition leader, wanted to kill him in order to end his presidential bid, the police said. Lee, 59, was released yesterday from a hospital in Seoul.
The police said that the 66-year-old man had written an eight-page manifesto and had planned the attack for months. The stabbing was the worst act of violence against a South Korean politician in nearly two decades and drew attention to the hostility between conservatives and liberals, which seemed to be​ deepening ahead of the parliamentary elections scheduled for April.

SPOTLIGHT ON AFRICA
A year of crucial elections
Africans in at least 17 countries will cast ballots this year to choose a president or national legislature. In West Africa, Senegal and Ghana, islands of stability in a region beset by coups, will hold elections. In East Africa, the youngest nation in the world, South Sudan, will also head to the polls, while in southern Africa a new generation of voters will test the parties that led the continent’s struggles for independence.
Here’s a look at the elections that will put democracy to the test in Africa.
Can liberation movements survive? A new generation of voters will test liberation-era parties in South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique and Botswana. South Africa is the most closely watched contest. There, 30 years after Nelson Mandela became president, the governing African National Congress faces widespread discontent.
Will a military junta hand over power? After successive coups, the ruling junta in Mali has promised to return power to a democratically elected government, but the generals in charge have already postponed the election scheduled for February, without announcing a new date.
Will a strongman be victorious? In power since 2000, President Paul Kagame is once again vying to lead Rwanda. Human rights groups have accused him of abuses, but Kagame points to the country’s relative economic successes since the genocide of 1994 as he cements his power.

A deadly blast in Iran.
A bombing in Iran killed over 100
Two explosions at a memorial for Iran’s former top general, Qassim Suleimani, killed at least 103 people and wounded an additional 211, according to Iranian officials, sowing fear in a country where domestic unrest and the prospect of a spiraling regional war have left many on edge. The attack came at a time of heightened anxiety in Iran and across the region.
Iranian officials told state media that a pair of bombs that had been placed in bags in the city of Kerman exploded, as a procession of people made its way there to commemorate the fourth anniversary of General Suleimani’s death. The architect of the axis of regional militias backed by Iran’s hard-line government, he was killed in an American drone strike.
The attack in Iran has led to finger-pointing, confusion and speculation after no group took responsibility. Officials in the government blamed the two countries that Tehran has long cast as archenemies, the U.S. and Israel. International intelligence experts and analysts said the attack bore the hallmarks of terrorist groups, not of Israel.
First person: “I heard the explosion 25 meters away from me,” a witness said. “On the ground, there were all women and children like withered flowers.”
What a leader’s death means for Hamas
The killing of Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas leader, deprives the militant group of one of its most skilled tacticians. He helped route money and weapons to Hamas operatives in the Gaza Strip and elsewhere in the Middle East and integrated the group more tightly into Iran’s network of forces committed to fighting Israel, according to analysts.
But it is not certain that his death, though a setback, will be a debilitating blow to the organization, which has rebuilt again and again after the assassinations of its leaders and has remained agile enough to plot the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in southern Israel. Israel has not taken responsibility for his killing.
His assassination also further internationalizes Israel’s war against Hamas, significantly raising the stakes for countries that host Hamas officials and putting new pressures on the group that could, if sustained, transform it.
Context: Israel’s overwhelming offensive in Gaza has significantly weakened the military strength of Hamas there. Al-Arouri’s position, as Hamas’s de facto ambassador to Iran and Hezbollah, meant that he would have had an important role in the group’s efforts to rebuild militarily with help from foreign backers.
In Israel: The Supreme Court postponed the enactment of a law that makes it harder to remove a prime minister from office, a setback for Benjamin Netanyahu.
Russia and Ukraine exchanged prisoners of war
Amid an escalating cycle of air assaults, Russia and Ukraine announced a mutual release of hundreds of prisoners of war, the biggest exchange between the two countries since the start of the conflict nearly two years ago. The deal was brokered by the United Arab Emirates, which has tried to cast itself as a neutral intermediary.
The Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement that 234 of its soldiers had returned from captivity, while President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on social media that 224 of his country’s soldiers and six civilians had come back.

The killing of foreign aid workers from World Central Kitchen brought international outrage. The death of their Palestinian driver drew less attention.
Saifeddin Abutaha, an aid worker for World Central Kitchen, was on his way home to see his mother when an Israeli missile struck the car he was driving in a humanitarian convoy last week.
Mr. Abutaha, 25, doted on his parents, and he texted them frequently while out delivering aid across the Gaza Strip, which is on the brink of famine after six months of war. In his final hours, he had pivoted between delivering food and making family Ramadan plans, his brother, Abdul Raziq Abutaha, said in an interview.
But since his death on April 1, their mother, Inshirah — who once daydreamed of seeing Saifeddin marry — has been unable to accept that he is gone.
“She still has not eaten anything since he died,” said Abdul Raziq, 33. He said that she keeps saying, “‘He will be back soon, maybe for Eid’” — the holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. It began on Wednesday. Saif will not be there.
The killing of seven World Central Kitchen employees in the Israeli attack has drawn international outrage, especially from the countries from which six of them hailed: Britain, Poland, Australia, Canada and the United States.
Mr. Abutaha, a Palestinian from Gaza, also perished in the attack. His death highlighted the grim fact that most of the more than 200 aid workers who have been killed since Israel’s bombardment of Gaza began have been Palestinian, according to United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres. He called last week for an independent investigation into each of their deaths, which have drawn less attention than the killing of foreign aid workers.
Palestinian workers form the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza, as do local employees in any war zone or disaster area where aid groups operate. They provide vital connections and on-the-ground expertise to foreign staff members unfamiliar with the area, and make it possible for them to implement relief projects and communicate with the people they are serving.
Mr. Abutaha worked for World Central Kitchen as a driver and translator, helping its staff navigate the bureaucracy, political climate and city streets of the places where he grew up, and where until the missile attack it was providing critically needed aid. His affiliation with a well-known and well-organized group brought with it something uncommon in Gaza these days, his family said: a semblance of safety.
“We never, ever thought Saif would be hit or killed,” Abdul Raziq said last week. “This is an international humanitarian group that had a very high coordination with Israel and its army.”
That coordination did not protect Mr. Abutaha and his co-workers. An internal investigation by the Israeli military concluded their killings were a “grave mistake” caused by a number of failures and broken protocols, and found that officers ordered the strikes on the aid convoy in part on the basis of insufficient and erroneous evidence that a passenger in one of the cars was armed.
Israel said several military personnel involved in the attack had been reprimanded or dismissed.
But José Andrés, the high-profile celebrity chef who founded World Central Kitchen, has demanded an independent investigation. On Sunday, in an interview on ABC’s “This Week,” he said “the perpetrator cannot be investigating himself.”
“Obviously this was targeted,” Mr. Andrés said of the killings, which were carried out by three separate strikes, one after another, that hit three vehicles carrying the workers. “We could argue that the first one, let’s say, was a mistake. The second? The third?”
Israel began its military campaign in Gaza after an Oct. 7 attack led by Hamas killed about 1,200 people near the border, according to Israeli authorities. Israel says its aim is to destroy the group.
But while the war has so far killed more than 33,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials, Hamas has not been destroyed. Its most senior leaders remain alive, its fighters remain active, and it has regrouped in parts of Gaza.
Abdul Raziq Abutaha said that before the war began his younger brother had been poised for as bright a future as any young person could hope for in the Gaza Strip, which has been under a punishing Egyptian and Israeli blockade since Hamas took power there in 2007.
Saif attended the Ajman University in the United Arab Emirates, Abdul Raziq said, and had worked in the U.A.E. until his father asked him to return home in 2020. He wanted Saif to help run the family business, a flour mill.
But running the mill became impossible during the war after Israel’s attacks destroyed much of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure, and left the company without basic raw materials like electricity or flour.
One day, though, World Central Kitchen staff members visited the family warehouse and liked what they saw. They chose the site to serve as their Gaza headquarters, after coordination with the Israeli military, Abdul Raziq said.
The aid workers began living in an apartment inside the factory, and they and the family soon grew close, sharing meals and bonding over the traumas of war.
“We loved them and they loved us,” Abdul Raziq said.
The World Central Kitchen staff asked Saif to translate for them during a meeting, and then hired him as a driver and translator. He and the foreign staff members quickly became inseparable, his sister Amani, said in an interview with Al-Ghad TV, an Arabic-language channel.
“He was always with the foreigners, translating for them, and he would go to collect aid,” she said. “Because he lived in Gaza and knew the streets of Gaza well, he was a driver.”
Abdul Raziq said his brother was “overjoyed” to find a job helping victims of the war, and that their family found a kind of blessing in the fact that “he died while he was on duty feeding poor and starving people” during the holy month of Ramadan.
On the day Saif died, the small World Central kitchen group had left their facility in the southern Gaza Strip and traveled north, Abdul Raziq said. Saif checked in with his family throughout the day; his sister said her last exchange with him was at 4 p.m., when Saif sent her a selfie he took while he waited for a cargo ship to arrive.
“I told him to take care of himself and may God protect him,” she said. “He replied, ‘I rely on God.’ I did not know that soon God would take everything.”
Saif also texted Abdul Raziq to say he was headed home to prepare for the next day’s Ramadan fast with their mother. He then sent one last text to their mother, asking, “Did you go to sleep yet, my mom?”

Direct Strikes on Israel Signal a 'New Paradigm' for Iran

Israel had grown used to targeting Iranian officials without head-on retaliation from Iran, an assumption overturned by Iran's attacks on Saturday.
Iran's unprecedented strikes on Israel this weekend have shaken Israel's assumptions about its foe, undermining its long-held calculation that Iran would be best deterred by greater Israeli aggression. 
  For years, Israeli officials have argued, both in public and in private, that the harder Iran is hit, the warier it will be about fighting back. Iran's barrage of more than 300 drones and missiles on Saturday -- the first direct attack by Iran on Israel -- has overturned that logic.
  The attack was a response to Israel's strike earlier this month in Syria that killed seven Iranian military officials there. Analysts said it showed that leaders in Tehran are no longer content with battling Israel through their various proxies, like Hezbollah in Lebanon or the Houthis in Yemen, but instead are prepared to take on Israel directly.
  ''I think we miscalculated,'' said Sima Shine, a former head of research for the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence agency.
  ''The accumulated experience of Israel is that Iran doesn't have good means to retaliate,'' Ms. Shine added. ''There was a strong feeling that they don't want to be involved in the war.''
  Instead, Iran has created ''a completely new paradigm,'' Ms. Shine said.
  Iran's response ultimately caused little damage in Israel, in large part because Iran had telegraphed its intentions well in advance, giving Israel and its allies several days to prepare a strong defense. Iran also released a statement, even before the attack was over, that it had no further plans to strike Israel.
  Nevertheless, Iran's strikes turn a yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran into a direct confrontation -- albeit one that could yet be contained, depending on how Israel responds. Iran has demonstrated that it has considerable firepower that can only be rebuffed with intensive support from Israel's allies, like the United States, underscoring how much damage it could potentially inflict without such protection.
  Iran and Israel once had a more ambiguous relationship, with Israel even selling arms to Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. But their ties later frayed after that war ended; Iranian leaders became increasingly critical of Israel's approach to the Palestinians, and Israel grew wary of Iran's efforts to build a nuclear program and its increased support for Hezbollah.
  For more than a decade, both countries have quietly targeted each other's interests across the region, while rarely announcing any individual action.
  Iran has supported Hamas and financed and armed other regional militias hostile to Israel, several of which have been engaged in a low-level conflict with Israel since the deadly attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7. Similarly, Israel has regularly targeted those proxies, as well as assassinated Iranian officials, including on Iranian soil, killings for which it avoids taking formal responsibility.
  Both countries have targeted merchant ships with links to their opponents, as well as carried out cyberattacks on one another, and Israel has repeatedly sabotaged Iran's nuclear program.
  Now, that war is out in the open. And in large part, it is because of what some analysts see as an Israeli miscalculation on April 1, when Israeli strikes destroyed part of an Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, Syria, one of Iran's closest allies and proxies, killing the seven Iranian military officials, including three top commanders.
  The attack followed repeated suggestions from Israeli leaders that greater pressure on Iran would encourage Tehran to scale back its ambitions across the Middle East. ''An increase in the pressure placed on Iran is critical,'' Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said in January, ''and may prevent regional escalation in additional arenas.''
  Instead, the Damascus attack led directly to the first Iranian assault on Israeli sovereign territory.
  Israel may have misunderstood Iran's position because of the lack of Iranian response to earlier Israeli assassinations of senior Iranian officials, analysts said.
  Though Israeli leaders have long feared that Iran will one day build and fire nuclear missiles at Israel, they had grown used to targeting Iranian officials without direct retaliation from Tehran.
  In one of the most brazen attacks, Israel killed Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in 2020 on Iranian soil. As recently as December, Israel was accused of killing a top Iranian general, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, in a strike in Syria, where Iranian military officials advise and support the Syrian government. Those and several other assassinations did not prompt retaliatory Iranian strikes on Israel.
  Iran's decision to respond this time was partly prompted by the fury in some circles of Iranian society at Iran's previous passivity, according to Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst.
  ''The degree of bottom-up pressure that I saw on the regime over the past 10 days, I've never seen before,'' said Mr. Vaez, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, a research group based in Brussels.
  Iran also needed to show proxies like Hezbollah that it could stand up for itself, Mr. Vaez added. ''To demonstrate that Iran is too afraid to retaliate against such a brazen attack on its own diplomatic facility in Damascus would have been very damaging for Iran's relations and the credibility of the Iranians in the eyes of their regional partners,'' he said.
  For some analysts, Israel's strike on Damascus may yet prove to have been a smaller miscalculation than it first appeared. Iran's aerial assault has already distracted from Israel's faltering war against Hamas, and reaffirmed Israel's ties with Western and Arab allies who had become increasingly critical of Israel's conduct in Gaza.
  The fact that Iran gave Israel so long to prepare for the attack could indicate that Tehran remains relatively deterred, seeking to create only the optics of a major response while trying to avoid a significant escalation, said Michael Koplow, an Israel analyst at the Israel Policy Forum, a research group based in New York.
  ''To me, the jury is out,'' Mr. Koplow said.
  ''The question is whether this was intended to be something that would actually damage Israel, or if this was supposed to be something that made it seem as though they were responding in strength, but actually signaled that they weren't,'' Mr. Koplow added.
  But for others, it was already clear. Aaron David Miller, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based research group, said that Israel had now made two major strategic errors in less than a year: Before Oct. 7, Israeli officials had publicly -- and wrongly -- concluded that Hamas had been deterred from attacking Israel.
  Then Hamas launched the deadliest attack in Israel's history.
  ''When it comes to conceptions, Israel is batting 0 for 2,'' said Mr. Miller. ''They failed to read Hamas's capacity and motivation correctly on Oct. 7 and they clearly misjudged how Iran would respond to the April 1 hit.''

Volunteers who treated patients in harrowing conditions lobbied American officials on the urgency of an immediate cease-fire.
The memories are indelible. Screaming families carrying bloodied loved ones through the doors of an overcrowded hospital. A boy trying to resuscitate a child who looked not much older than himself. A 12-year-old with shrapnel wounds to his head and abdomen being intubated on the ground.
What he saw that January day at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza — after a missile strike on an aid distribution site — has haunted Dr. Zaher Sahloul, an American critical care specialist with years of experience treating patients in war zones, including in Syria and Ukraine.
He and other volunteer doctors who have returned from besieged hospitals in Gaza took their firsthand accounts to Washington this week, hoping to convey the suffering to the Biden administration and senior government officials and to press for an immediate cease-fire.
Dr. Sahloul showed American officials — including members of Congress and officials from the White House, State Department, Defense Department and the United States Agency for International Development — a photo of the 12-year-old boy and his death certificate. The child never woke up from surgery after being intubated, the doctor said, and the hospital could not reach his family amid a near-total communications blackout.
Two other doctors in the delegation — Amber Alayyan, a Paris-based deputy program manager for Doctors Without Borders, and Nick Maynard, a British surgeon — said that medical system in Gaza had been wiped out by the war between Israel and Hamas.
“This is the deliberate destruction of the whole health care system,” Dr. Maynard said in an interview.
He described operating on chest injuries from explosions with few anesthetics or antibiotics at the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al Balah in central Gaza in December and January. “The lack of pain relief was particularly disturbing because we saw lots of children with awful burns,” he said.
There was a limited supply of sterile gloves and surgical drapes, and the hospital’s record-keeping abilities had collapsed, rendering follow-up care nearly impossible, he said. Dr. Maynard said he walked through hallways packed with displaced people to check on patients he had operated on and sometimes failed to find them.
Also in the delegation was Thaer Ahmad, a Palestinian American emergency medicine physician. He was with Dr. Sahloul in January as Israeli forces encircled Khan Younis and began closing in on Nasser Hospital, the largest still functioning in the enclave at the time.
“I had to go,” Dr. Ahmad said in an interview. “They’re my people.”
He said that he had a toddler and a 2-month-old baby at home in Chicago when he traveled to Gaza. He contrasted his wife’s experience of delivery — in a safe, well-resourced hospital with an obstetrician she knows well — with the plight of pregnant women in Gaza, who have been starving and giving birth in shelters. 
Not long after the doctors left Gaza, Nasser Hospital was raided by Israeli forces in what the military said was a search for Hamas members, weapons and the bodies of Israeli hostages. Before that, fighting had raged around the sprawling hospital for weeks, devastating the surrounding area. 
The Israeli military said at the time that its operation was “conducted to ensure minimal disruption to the hospital’s ongoing activities.” Videos from the raid depicted chaos inside the damaged, smoke-filled hospital, punctuated by automatic gunfire and explosions, and health ministry described rapidly deteriorating conditions, and said patients had died from a lack of power and oxygen, and video footage from the scene.
“I will regret, for the rest of my life, leaving when I did,” Dr. Ahmad said.

Also, the rise of “carefluencers.”
The war in Gaza, six months in
Sunday marks six months since the Oct. 7 attacks that started Israel’s war against Hamas. More than 32,000 Palestinians have died, people are desperate for aid and dozens of Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza.
I spoke with Patrick Kingsley, our Jerusalem bureau chief, to understand the state of the war.
How close are we to a deal, or a meaningful pause in the fighting?
We are at an impasse.
Ceasefire negotiations are stuck for several reasons, but in large part because Israel wants to limit the ways in which Hamas could regroup during a temporary truce, whereas Hamas wants the kind of truce that would allow it to reorganize on the ground.
While those talks falter, Gaza is in limbo. Israel plans to invade Rafah, Hamas’s last major stronghold, but has delayed doing so while it tries to gather international support for the operation.
Elsewhere in Gaza, Hamas is largely routed. But there is a chaotic power vacuum because Israel has withdrawn from certain areas without transferring power there to other Palestinian groups, amid disagreements in Israel about who should run a postwar Gaza.
The result is that the war has slowed since the start of the year. But it continues to kill, and has left the territory on the verge of what experts say is a looming famine.
What do both sides want?
To achieve the goals Israel set for itself at the start of the war, it needs Hamas to be completely ousted from the strip.
But Hamas only needs to survive to claim some kind of success. Even though on the battlefield it suffered huge losses, the fact that it’s still standing means it could yet claim some kind of Pyrrhic victory.
To release all the hostages who remain in Gaza, Israel may have to agree to a permanent cease-fire. If Hamas releases all the hostages without a long-term truce, it would endanger its long-term presence in Gaza, which is a risk its leaders aren’t likely to take.
Israel and Hamas have fought in the past. Why is this war more devastating than others?
For Palestinians and their supporters, it’s the result of Israel’s abject disregard for civilian life and its willingness to prioritize the eradication of Hamas over the likely collateral costs to human life and civilian property.
To Israel and its supporters, the damage and the death toll is the result of Hamas embedding itself inside civilian areas, in houses and underneath houses in their subterranean tunnel network.
We have seen these completely divergent interpretations in previous Gaza wars. What makes this conflict different is that Israel, deeply traumatized by Hamas’s attack on Oct. 7, is now seeking to destroy Hamas instead of setting it back by a few months, as it tried to do in previous conflicts.
That maximalist goal has led to a longer and much more devastating war.
What do the next six months look like?
A few months ago it felt like we might see some kind of grand deal to end this war and maybe even see some progress in the wider efforts to end the broader Israel-Palestinian conflict.
Now, it seems like the most likely short-term outcome is just more of the same. The negotiations will continue to stutter. Israel will continue to stall on either the Rafah invasion or a power transition in the rest of Gaza. Hamas will continue to hold out in Rafah and try to regroup elsewhere, which will lead Israel to re-enter areas it already vacated.
All of that may create a kind of slow-burning stalemate. It would not surprise me if we were still stuck in this strange, deadly stasis even on the war’s one-year anniversary.
The latest news:
Benjamin Netanyahu: Israel’s leader is facing eroding domestic support as the international outcry grows over civilian deaths in Gaza.
President Biden: He called Netanyahu yesterday, and told him that future U.S. support will be determined by how Israel treats civilians in Gaza, according to a White House summary.
South Korea doctors’ strike stretches patience
Thousands of residents and interns at South Korean hospitals walked off the job six weeks ago. Now, frustration is rising as surgeries are canceled and nurses have taken on duties usually performed by physicians.
Much of the anger has been aimed at President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is holding firm to his proposal to expand medical school admissions. But many are also exasperated by the doctors, accusing them of trying to protect their elite status, and their income, by keeping the number of doctors low.
How healthy are Biden and Trump really?
Many American voters believe both President Biden and Donald Trump — the oldest people ever to seek the presidency — are both too old for the office.
Although their doctors have proclaimed them fit to serve, neither has agreed to share his medical charts with the public, and they are being far less open about their health than previous American leaders. Our reporter explains the challenges in this video.

A speech by Jerrold Nadler, a long-serving Jewish Democrat and supporter of Israel, was met with a mixed response at a New York rally calling for the release of hostages in Gaza.
Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York was booed on Sunday at a demonstration in Manhattan calling for the release of hostages held by Hamas after he encouraged attendees to also push for humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza.
“As we remember the heinous crimes committed by Hamas, we must continue to press for lifesaving humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people, too,” Mr. Nadler, a Democrat and the longest-serving Jewish member of the House of Representatives, said during a speech at the event at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, near the United Nations headquarters.
While some people in the crowd applauded, others began to boo as he went on: “We must do more, because we are better than Hamas. We must do more to bring food and assistance to those who are suffering.” The heckling grew louder and continued until the end of the congressman’s remarks as more attendees joined in, some chanting “bring them home” or “shame.”
A crowd that appeared to number in the thousands had gathered for the demonstration, whose date was chosen to mark six months since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel. As police officers looked on, participants arrived holding Israeli flags and signs that said “Bring them home now.” The event was coordinated by over 150 organizations, including synagogues, pro-Israel groups and the New York chapter of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which was founded in the wake of the attacks. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, according to the Israeli authorities.
Mr. Nadler, introduced as a “leader who is a strong supporter of Israel and a fighter of antisemitism,” was among a list of speakers that included family members of hostages and Naftali Bennett, a former Israeli prime minister.
The response to Mr. Nadler reflected a divide among Jewish New Yorkers over the way Israel is conducting its war against Hamas. Some reject any criticism of Israel, while others, including activist groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, have rallied for a cease-fire, denouncing the Israeli and U.S. governments over the mounting death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
“The minority who interfered with Nadler’s speech does not represent the Hostages Families Forum, nor the families themselves,” Shany Granot-Lubaton, an organizer with Hostages and Missing Families Forum New York, said after the event. She said the rally showed “how our people can be united even though we can have so many different opinions on so many different things” and that freeing the hostages was “the number one priority of all of us — right to left, secular and Orthodox.”
“We respect and thank Congress member Nadler for coming today and for being a part of our fight to bring every one of our hostages back home,” she added. “We know that he’s been working tirelessly for this cause.”
Robert Gottheim, Mr. Nadler’s chief of staff, said the congressman wasn’t saying anything extraordinary. “We have to have humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people; that goes without saying,” Mr. Gottheim said.
Mr. Nadler paused amid the booing and heckling before continuing and wrapping up his speech with a reference to the story of Passover, Mr. Gottheim said. “The thrust of his statement was what everyone was there for: Bring the hostages back.”
The event also included an installation meant to convey the suffering of those still in captivity. Seven people, wrapped in chains, sat inside dog cages on the ground as three others stood nearby with their hands chained together. All were dressed in white clothes with red paint smeared across their bodies.

The American draft resolution before the Security Council did not go far enough to end the Israel-Hamas war, Russia and China said, after the United States had vetoed three earlier resolutions.
A U.S. bid to have the U.N. Security Council call for ''an immediate and sustained cease-fire'' in the Gaza Strip failed on Friday, after Russia and China vetoed the American resolution that included some of Washington's strongest language since the start of the war. 
  The resolution reflected the Biden administration's growing frustration both with the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza and Israel's conduct in a war that has killed about 30,000 people and reduced much of the enclave to ruins. The administration has been pressuring Israel not to attack the southern Gazan city of Rafah, where more than a million civilians have sought refuge, and to enable more aid to enter the territory.
  But international frictions, including over Washington's previous use of its veto power in the Security Council and its refusal to call for a permanent cease-fire, doomed the resolution. Eleven members voted in favor of the resolution, but Russia and China -- permanent members -- voted against it, as did Algeria. Guyana abstained.
  Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who was traveling in Israel on Friday, expressed disappointment that the resolution failed.
  ''I think we were trying to show the international community a sense of urgency about getting a cease-fire tied to the release of hostages, something that everyone, including the countries that vetoed the resolution, should have been able to get behind,'' he said.
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel reiterated his stance that despite growing international criticism, his country's ground forces would launch an offensive into Rafah to root out Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7 assault that precipitated Israel's invasion of Gaza. The Biden administration has said repeatedly that an incursion into Rafah, which is on the border with Egypt, would cause heavy civilian casualties and impede aid delivery.
  ''We have no way to defeat Hamas without going into Rafah and eliminating the rest of the battalions there,'' Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement on Friday after meeting in Tel Aviv with Mr. Blinken. ''And I told him that I hope we will do it with the support of the U.S. But if we must, we will do it alone.''
  The U.S. resolution said the Security Council ''determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained cease-fire.'' Representatives from the three dissenting countries and Guyana said it did not go far enough in demanding or compelling a cease-fire.
  Amar Bendjama, the Algerian ambassador to the United Nations, said a reference in the measure to reducing harm to civilians in ''ongoing and future operations'' in Gaza implied a ''license for continuing bloodshed.''
  ''The text presented today does not convey a clear message of peace,'' Mr. Bendjama said.
  After the vote, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, defended the resolution, which condemned Hamas, saying that it had been brought forward ''in good faith after consulting with all Council members and after multiple rounds of edits.''
  She said Russia and China had vetoed the resolution for two reasons: They refused to condemn Hamas and they ''simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was penned by the United States because it would rather see us fail than to see this Council succeed.''
  Whether or not Russia and China were motivated by a desire to thwart or embarrass the United States, it is clear that their relations with Washington are as hostile as they have ever been in decades, with conflicts over a host of issues, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China's designs on Taiwan, economic sanctions and trade tariffs. In 2022, Russia vetoed two Security Council resolutions condemning its conduct in Ukraine.
  Ms. Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. draft would have put the Security Council's weight behind diplomatic efforts ''to secure an immediate and sustained cease-fire as part of a deal that leads to the release of all hostages'' and ''allow much more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza.''
  Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, had denounced the U.S.-backed measure before the vote, calling it a ''hypocritical initiative'' and ''a diluted formulation'' regarding a cease-fire.
  ''To save the lives of peaceful Palestinians, this is not enough,'' he said. The draft, he asserted, was written with U.S. political interests in mind, to ''play to the voters, to throw them a bone.''
  He urged Council members to vote against the resolution, saying, ''We cannot allow the Security Council to become an instrument in advancement of Washington's destructive policy in the Middle East.''
  The United States had vetoed three previous resolutions demanding a stop to the fighting in Gaza, arguing that the measures could disrupt hostage negotiations and staunchly defending Israel's right to defend itself after the Hamas-led attack of Oct. 7. In each of those earlier Security Council votes, the United States cast the only one against the resolutions. Russia and Britain abstained from the first vote, in October, and Britain abstained from the votes in December and February.
  But as the death toll has increased in Gaza, and as hunger and disease have worsen across the territory, President Biden and other U.S. officials have grown increasingly critical of Mr. Netanyahu and his handling of the war, calling on him to let more aid into Gaza and to do more to protect civilians.
  After meeting on Friday with Mr. Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet, Mr. Blinken said at a news conference that an immediate cease-fire would allow for the release of hostages and for ''surging'' humanitarian aid to alleviate the acute suffering among the territory's 2.2 million civilians.
  Mr. Blinken, concluding his sixth Middle East trip since the war began, warned that a major military ground operation in Rafah was not how to ensure Israel's long-term security.
  ''It risks further isolating Israel around the world and jeopardizing its long-term security and standing,'' he said, adding that U.S. officials were looking forward to meeting with Israeli officials in Washington next week ''to talk about a different way of achieving those objectives.''
  Mr. Netanyahu said in his statement that Israel recognized the need to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian aid for Gaza but was determined to proceed with the planned incursion.
  Benny Gantz, Mr. Netanyahu's chief political rival, appeared to endorse that position, saying in a statement that Israel must ''dismantle Hamas's military infrastructure, including in Rafah.'' Mr. Gantz, an opposition leader who crossed parliamentary lines to join the war cabinet, thanked Mr. Blinken ''for his support for Israel and the deep American commitment to its security.''
  U.S. officials said that they believed no operation into Rafah by the Israeli military was imminent, giving the United States time to either help cement a hostage deal that would put in place a temporary cease-fire or propose other options to the Israelis at meetings next week.
  Israel is not yet prepared to push its forces into Rafah, which will be a difficult ground operation to pull off, they said.
  As the secretary of state made the last stop of a multileg Middle Eastern tour, William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director, was traveling to Qatar to join talks aimed at reaching a deal between Israel and Hamas that would begin a time-limited cease-fire and an exchange of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel for Israeli hostages held in Gaza.
  Speaking to reporters in Cairo on Thursday, Mr. Blinken said that gaps between the Hamas and Israeli negotiating positions were ''narrowing,'' but that striking a deal would be difficult.

More than 60,000 Israelis who live far from Gaza but close to the front line of another spiraling conflict have in recent months been ordered from their homes along Israel's northern border with Lebanon -- the first mass evacuation of the area in Israeli history.
In one Israeli border town, antitank missiles fired from Lebanon have damaged scores of homes. In another village, holdouts who refuse to evacuate said they avoided turning lights on at night to keep from becoming visible targets. And in a sign of the proximity of the fighters across the border and how personal the simmering hostilities have become, a farmer said he had received a text message claiming to be from Hezbollah and threatening him with death. 
  The evacuations and an effort in Lebanon to move thousands of civilians away from the border are the result of an intensifying conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political organization.
  The skirmish along Israel's northern border is being fought in parallel with the more intense war in Gaza, which Israel launched after Hamas's Oct. 7 attack. Now also in its sixth month, the battle with Hezbollah has implications both for the prospects of a wider regional conflict and for the thousands of civilians who live along the frontier.
  Israel has responded forcefully to Hezbollah's attacks: Above the hills and valleys of Israel's border with Lebanon, Israeli warplanes rumble overhead. In the recent fighting, at least eight civilians in Israel and 51 in Lebanon have been killed, according to the Israeli and Lebanese authorities, as have combatants on both sides.
  A recent two-day trip through the Galilee Panhandle -- a finger of Israeli territory that juts into Lebanon -- and west toward the Mediterranean coast revealed a mostly abandoned landscape stalked by fear and overtaken by nature. This stretch of Israel has become a virtual no-go zone, even to families who have lived in the area for generations. Military checkpoints block access to communities within a mile or so of the frontier, and daily life is frozen in a state of anxious suspension.
  Residents of the region are split over whether the government was right to order an evacuation. Some say it showed weakness and effectively handed Hezbollah a victory. Others say it has saved countless lives.
  Chaim Amedi, 82, a resident of Kfar Yuval, a now mostly deserted village barely a mile from Lebanon, has refused to abandon the town his parents founded in the 1950s and evacuate to a hotel. ''You don't leave a home,'' he said, adding that ''hotels are for vacations.''
  Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite group that is better armed and organized than its Hamas allies in Gaza, began firing across the border after Oct. 7. The attacks have been big enough to demonstrate the group's solidarity with Hamas, but measured enough so far to prevent provoking an all-out conflict with Israel.
  Some days, Hezbollah has fired up to 100 short-range rockets. Israel, in turn, has struck targets up to 60 miles inside Lebanon.
  In Kiryat Shmona, normally an Israeli city of about 24,000, about 1,500 inhabitants remain. Many residents, now scattered among 220 hotels across Israel, did not even wait for the government's order on Oct. 20 to evacuate.
  The town's banks and malls are closed. The start-up companies at the city's burgeoning food-technology hub have left. Only one eatery is open -- a modest shawarma and falafel joint catering mainly to soldiers.
  Toby Abutbul, 22, the son of the owner, showed reporters video footage of what he said were two anti-tank missiles landing in front of him last month as he drove on the city's main road. An air-raid siren sounded only after the missiles struck. A nearby woman and her teenage son were severely wounded, according to the local authorities.
  Israel's Iron Dome system can intercept many types of rockets, which fly in high arcs and are difficult to aim, but nowadays, Hezbollah also fires rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles. Israel has no immediate answer for such weapons, which allow for more precise line-of-sight targeting, fly low to the ground and hit targets in seconds and without warning.
  Hezbollah's use of those weapons means there is no time to run to a shelter, said Ariel Frish, the deputy security manager for Kiryat Shmona. If anything happens, the instructions are to hit the ground wherever you are.
  Itay and Niv Tamir, a couple in their 30s, returned home in late January with their sons, ages 1 and 4, to the border community of Kibbutz HaGoshrim.
  They risked returning, they said, in part because their house is not in the direct line of sight from Lebanon. Nevertheless, the boys sleep in a bombproof safe room.
  ''We try not to let the fear control us,'' Ms. Tamir said. But, she added, the family rarely ventures far outdoors given that much of the kibbutz is within view of villages in Lebanon.
  An anti-tank missile in December crashed through an auditorium in Kibbutz Sasa, according to the military and local officials. Hezbollah has also employed exploding drones, with which they have struck an army base, according to the group and the military.
  Israeli government and military officials say they are considering military action to push Hezbollah back from the border unless a diplomatic effort can achieve the same result first. In the meantime, the death toll on both sides is rising.
  This month, the Israeli military said that its air and ground forces had struck more than 4,500 Hezbollah targets in both Lebanon and neighboring Syria since Oct. 7, and that they had killed more than 300 Hezbollah operatives. Hezbollah's official website and spokesman said that ''more than 200'' of its fighters had been killed to date.
  Fourteen Israeli soldiers have been killed in the north so far, according to the Israeli authorities.
  For decades, Israel's northern towns and villages were targets for militants based in Lebanon. Armed Palestinian groups infiltrated the border in the 1970s and 1980s, entering homes, hijacking buses and taking schoolchildren hostage. The city of Kiryat Shmona, in the Galilee Panhandle, was plagued by Katyusha rocket fire and was long a symbol of Israeli resilience.
  Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and left in 2000. During Israel's long occupation, Lebanese villagers crossed the border daily to work on Israeli farms and in the towns of the Galilee.
  Even during the worst battles of the past, including a devastating, monthlong war with Hezbollah in 2006, Israel never formally evacuated the border towns.
  Since that war ended, residents say they have seen fighters who appear to be from Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces monitoring them through the border fence, violating a United Nations-backed cease-fire that ended the war and was meant to establish a demilitarized zone.
  ''They studied each community, studied us personally, our routines, our places of employment, waiting for an opportunity,'' said Eitan Davidi, 53, a farmer from Margaliot, a small village abutting the border. ''They know when I come, when I go. They know my kids.''
  In January, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military's spokesman, said at a news conference that Radwan fighters were operating along the border.
  Mr. Davidi, who produces chicken eggs and owns fruit orchards, said the war became particularly personal after he gave interviews to the Israeli news media in which he said Lebanese border villages harboring Hezbollah fighters should be razed -- ''Not on their heads,'' he said, clarifying that he was referring only to the buildings.
  First, he said, he received a threatening WhatsApp message reminding him in Hebrew that his chicken coops had already been hit twice. ''We won't miss the target a third time,'' the message read. It was signed Hezbollah. The New York Times, which viewed the message, could not independently confirm its origin.
  Next came a social media post from a correspondent for Al Manar, Hezbollah's television channel, calling Mr. Davidi the ''mule'' of Margaliot. The post included images of gunmen on the Lebanese side of the border with Mr. Davidi's village, his chicken coops and home visible in the background.
  Missiles and rockets have since incinerated most of his coops. One exploded in his backyard. An anti-tank missile fired into Margaliot on March 4 killed a farm laborer from India and injured seven more foreign workers, according to the Israeli military.
  Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have also blamed Israel for targeting civilians across the border. Last month, after a family was killed in an Israeli strike, Najib Mikati, Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, accused Israel of ''killing and targeting of innocent children, women, and older adults.'' After the same attack, Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, vowed Israel would ''pay the price of spilling their blood.''
  A sixth-generation farmer from Metula, Tal Levit, 45, who now serves in the military reserves as a member of the town's emergency response team, said his home had also been struck by Hezbollah.
  Speaking at a rest stop south of Metula, he said he had seen people on the Lebanese side of the fence monitoring the town. ''Some were half in uniform, or were dressed as shepherds,'' he said. ''They were photographing, preparing.''
  In the summer months, he said, the leaves of a pecan tree obscure his house from prying eyes, but the winter left it exposed. Generally, Mr. Levit has been careful not to go home wearing his military uniform. But one day last month, he entered his house to do laundry and have a cup of coffee. An hour after he left, a missile penetrated the roof and exploded inside, he said.
  On the approach to Kfar Yuval, a faded road sign reads, ''Border Ahead.'' A mother and her son, who was a member of the village's armed response team, were killed in January when an anti-tank rocket struck their home on the edge of the village, according to the Israeli military.
  Along the village pathways, orange trees are heavy with unpicked fruit. The top half of a children's plastic slide emerges from the green sea of an overgrown lawn. Most of the houses are shuttered.
  The silence one recent afternoon was broken by a long series of booms.
  It was hard to tell who was firing on whom.

Military analysts are divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran might alter the war or affect a decision to invade the southern city of Rafah.
Within moments of Israel and its allies shooting down a fusillade of Iranian missiles and drones this weekend, many began wondering what the latest exchange between Israel and Iran would mean for the war in the Gaza Strip.
The Iranian attack was retaliation for what was widely believed to be an Israeli strike this month on an embassy building in Damascus that killed seven Iranian officials, including three top commanders in Iran’s armed forces. But it occurred against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, where Israel is battling Hamas, a militant group funded and armed by Iran.
Israeli military analysts were divided on whether a more direct confrontation with Iran would alter the war in Gaza, now in its sixth month. The next fulcrum in that war could hinge on whether Israel decides to pursue Hamas in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have fled amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.
Some analysts argued that the implications for Gaza would depend on whether Israel responded with a major counterattack against Iran. Others contended that Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip would be unaffected.
Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general and a former director of the Israeli military’s strategic planning division, said that if Israel responds with substantial force to the Iranian attack, it could incite a multifront war that would compel the Israeli leadership to move its attention away from Gaza.
In the case of a significant regional conflagration, General Brom said, Israel might choose to delay its plans to invade Rafah, which Israeli officials describe as the last Hamas stronghold.
“It’s not comfortable for us to have simultaneous, high-intensity wars in multiple theaters,” General Brom added.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to send ground forces into Rafah, despite international pressure to back off the operation. On Sunday, an Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that the Iranian attack would have no effect on the military’s plan to invade Rafah.
A large-scale direct confrontation with Iran could potentially bring the war in Gaza to a close, General Brom said. But for the war to end in such a way, it would require a broader cease-fire that encompassed several parties, including Israel, Iran and the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah.
“There’s an idea that in order to resolve a crisis, the situation first needs to become worse,” he said, explaining that an escalation followed by a comprehensive cease-fire with Iran might incline that country to push its regional proxies to stop fighting with Israel.
While the members of Israel’s war cabinet did not issue a formal statement after meeting on Sunday, a separate Israeli official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, indicated that the country would respond to the Iranian assault — although there was considerable uncertainty as to when and how.
Other military experts, however, dismissed the link between the Iranian attack and the war in Gaza.
“There’s no connection at all,” said Amos Gilead, a retired major general who served in Israeli military intelligence.
General Gilead said that Israel’s Army had enough resources to fight against Iran and continue to wage war against Hamas in Gaza.
Others analysts made a similar point, arguing that the resources needed to fight Iran were different from those needed in Gaza. Israel needs fighter jets and air defense systems to counter Iran, they said. In contrast, they added, the army mainly requires ground troops, drones and attack helicopters to fight Hamas in Gaza.
“There’s no real tension between these two things,” said Giora Eiland, a retired major general and former head of Israel’s National Security Council.
Still, General Eiland said that the success of the coalition that repelled the Iranian attack, which included the United States, Britain and Jordan, could inspire Israel to take advantage of the momentum to overcome its declining status internationally by ending the war in Gaza.
Though the United States, Israel’s closest ally, has broadly supported Israel’s decision to go to war in Gaza, it has increasingly signaled its displeasure over the mounting death toll and warned against a major ground assault in Rafah. The support the United States provided Israel on Sunday in shooting down Iranian drones and missiles could give it more leverage over its Israeli counterparts.
While General Eiland said such an outcome could help Israel develop good will in the international community and contribute to reaching a solution to end the war in Gaza and skirmishes with Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia in Lebanon, he was doubtful that Mr. Netanyahu would purse such a path.
“He says he wants to achieve ‘total victory’ in Gaza and conquer Rafah, a process that could last two or three months,” he said, referring to the prime minister. “It’s clear Netanyahu has a different mind-set and priorities.”

Also, Mexico and Nicaragua severed diplomatic relations with Ecuador.
Israel withdraws some troops
The Israeli military said it withdrew a division of ground troops from southern Gaza yesterday. The move raised questions about its plans as the war reached the six-month mark — Israeli media reported that the withdrawal meant there were no Israeli troops actively maneuvering in southern Gaza.
It was unclear what the latest drawdown of forces meant for the prospect of an Israeli ground offensive in Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city. Israel has significantly reduced the number of troops it has on the ground over the past several months. Only a fraction of the soldiers that it had deployed in the territory earlier in the war remain.
Israel has routed Hamas in much of Gaza, and fighting seems to have slowed. But the conflict is being drawn out by Israel’s reluctance to either hold ground it has captured or transfer its control to an alternative Palestinian leadership.
The withdrawal came as international mediators were set to meet in Cairo to pick up stalled negotiations on a temporary cease-fire and the release of hostages held in the enclave. At the same time, concerns have mounted that Iran will retaliate for an Israeli strike in Syria that killed senior commanders of Iran’s elite Quds Force.
In Israel: The military said it had retrieved and repatriated the body of a 47-year-old hostage held in Gaza.
In Gaza: Khobeza, a spinach-like wild plant that sprouts after rains, has become a lifeline for hungry people.
Mexico breaks ties with Ecuador
Mexico severed its diplomatic ties with Ecuador on Friday after Ecuadorean police arrested an Ecuadorean politician, Jorge Glas, who had been granted political asylum in Mexico’s embassy in Quito, the capital. The next day, Nicaragua also announced it was suspending its diplomatic relationship with Ecuador, characterizing the arrest as “neo-fascist political barbarity.”
That arrest, which Mexico described as a “violation” of its sovereignty, capped days of growing tensions between the countries. Ecuador has considered Glas, a former vice president, a fugitive, and said its police force was acting on an arrest warrant for him.
Glas: He was convicted of bribery in two separate cases and fled to the embassy after facing more embezzlement charges.
30 years after Rwanda’s genocide
Rwanda observed the 30th anniversary of the devastating genocide in the central African country, a 100-day rampage in which extremists from the ethnic Hutu majority killed 800,000 people — most of them ethnic Tutsis, a minority group.
The daylong tribute included a wreath-laying ceremony at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, the final resting place for the remains of over 250,000 victims. “Rwanda was completely humbled by the magnitude of our loss, and the lessons we learned are engraved in blood,” President Paul Kagame, who led Tutsi rebels during the genocide, said yesterday.
Context: Rwanda has made impressive gains in maternal mortality, poverty, education and health access. But ethnic divisions persist under Kagame, an iron-fisted president who has ruled the country ever since the genocide. He is up for election this year and is expected to win another seven-year term.

“The food production system has been completely obliterated, and the lack of entry of emergency aid within a short time has created a free fall,” a United Nations official said.
Six months into the Israel-Hamas war, the people of Gaza are facing a hunger crisis that the United Nations says borders on famine.
The crisis in Gaza is entirely human-made, a result of Israel’s war on Hamas and a near-complete siege of the territory, aid experts say. Conflicts were also at the root of the other two disasters in the last two decades that were classified by a global authority as famines, in Sudan and Somalia, though in those countries drought was also a significant underlying factor.
Here’s a look at how Gaza reached this point.
The food shortages in Gaza have been created by Israel’s blockade and military operations.
For years before the latest war, Gaza was subject to an Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt. Under the blockade, humanitarian aid, including food and commercial imports, was tightly restricted. Even so, levels of malnutrition among Gaza’s roughly 2.2 million people were low and comparable to those of countries in the region.
After Oct. 7, when Hamas led a deadly attack on Israel that incited the war, Israel imposed a siege and instituted much stricter controls on what could go into Gaza, stopping anything it believed could potentially benefit Hamas from entering. At the same time, Israel blocked commercial imports of food that had filled Gaza’s shops and markets.
It also bombed Gaza’s port, restricted fishing and bombed many of the territory’s farms. Airstrikes and fighting have shattered Gaza’s infrastructure and forced almost all of its population to flee their homes. That displacement, plus the destruction of businesses and a surge in prices, has made it hard for families to feed themselves.
“The food production system has been completely obliterated, and the lack of entry of emergency aid within a short time has created a free fall,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian office.
Famine has a precise definition for the United Nations and aid groups.
This week, Samantha Power, the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that a famine was underway in northern Gaza, the part of the territory most cut off from aid. Her agency later said that assessment was based on data collected in March, not on new information, but that “conditions remain dire.”
That data was released by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, an initiative of U.N. bodies and major relief agencies that is also known as the I.P.C.,. The I.P.C. has not yet classified the situation in Gaza as a famine but said last month that one was imminent in the north. The body defines a famine as at least 20 percent of households facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30 percent of children suffering from acute malnutrition, and at least two adults or four children for every 10,000 people dying each day from starvation or disease linked to malnutrition.
Since 2004, when the system was set up, there have been two famines, according to that definition. In 2011, the United Nations declared famine in parts of Somalia, which had endured decades of conflict. Years of drought wrecked the agricultural sector and the economy, forcing many people to leave their homes in search of food. At the same time, an Islamist insurgent group blocked starving people from fleeing and forced out Western aid organizations. In all, around 250,000 people died.
Six years later, a famine was declared in parts of South Sudan. The country had suffered years of drought, but the U.N. said that the famine was human-made. Millions of people had fled because of a civil war, destroying the country’s economy, and rebel forces and government soldiers blocked aid and hijacked food trucks. Tens of thousands died.
Gaza is small and mostly urban, so food should be close at hand.
Gaza is just 25 miles long and largely urban, and there is no shortage of food on the other side of its borders, with Israel and Egypt.
Still, aid agencies have found doing their jobs difficult. Six months of war have included the killings of scores of aid workers, including seven from World Central Kitchen, the relief group founded by the chef José Andrés. Those employees were killed by an Israeli drone strike on April 1 after delivering tons of food to a warehouse.
There is a sharp disagreement in Gaza between the U.N. and the Israeli government about how much aid is entering Gaza each day, but aid organizations say they need better access, particularly to northern Gaza. The Israeli authorities have repeatedly denied permission for aid convoys to move within Gaza, they say. 
Arif Husain, the chief economist at the World Food Program, said that what made the situation in Gaza so shocking was the scale and severity of the crisis and how quickly it had developed.
Israel claims it has placed no limits on aid. Critics disagree.
Critics of the way Israel is conducting the war say that the hunger crisis derives largely from Israeli restrictions on where trucks can enter and from an onerous inspection process. Some have accused Israel of slowing aid down to punish Gazans for the Oct. 7 attack.
Israeli officials say they have placed no limits on the amount of aid that can flow into Gaza. They blame the U.N., particularly UNRWA, the main agency that helps Palestinians, for failing to distribute aid effectively. 
COGAT, the Israeli agency responsible for coordinating aid deliveries into Gaza, says that it has “surged” deliveries in recent days and is opening an additional entry point in northern Gaza. More broadly, the Israeli government holds Hamas responsible for all civilian suffering in Gaza. (UNRWA said last month that Israel had denied the group access to northern Gaza, though Israel has rebutted that claim.)
Governments around the world have urged Israel to address the crisis quickly. President Biden last week warned that the United States could withhold support for Israel if it did not ensure adequate aid deliveries and protect civilians. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden said that the steps Israel had taken since then were “not enough.”

In a visit to the Rafah border crossing, Secretary General António Guterres called for an immediate cease-fire and expressed solidarity with Palestinians in the territory.
António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, reiterated his call on Saturday for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza, using a visit to a border crossing in Egypt to slam the ''nonstop nightmare'' Palestinians faced in the territory. 
  ''I want Palestinians in Gaza to know: You are not alone,'' Mr. Guterres said. ''People around the world are outraged about the horrors we are all witnessing in real time. I carry the voices of the vast majority of the world: We have seen enough. We have heard enough.''
  Mr. Guterres spoke to reporters from the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, one of the two main ground corridors being used to transport desperately needed humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. More than five months into Israel's war against Hamas, Palestinians in Gaza are facing widespread hunger and deprivation despite a huge international relief effort.
  For months, aid organizations have struggled to transport and distribute sufficient food and other supplies in Gaza, which faces a blockade that is jointly enforced by Egypt and Israel.
  U.N. officials have said the obstacles include lengthy Israeli security inspections, attacks on aid convoys by desperate Palestinians and organized gangs, and roads badly damaged by months of airstrikes and fighting. Israel has blamed the delays on U.N. staffing and logistics and says it does not impose limits on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza.
  The worsening conditions this week led the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a global authority that has classified food security crises for decades, to project that famine was ''imminent'' for the 300,000 Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza. Aid groups and U.N. officials have argued that it would be better for Israel to ease entry restrictions for trucks at established crossing points into the enclave and to do more to speed the delivery of goods inside Gaza.
  ''From this crossing, we see the heartbreak and heartlessness of it all: a long line of blocked red relief trucks on one side of the gates, the long shadow of starvation on the other,'' Mr. Guterres said. ''That is more than tragic -- it is a moral outrage.''
  Israel's minister of foreign affairs, Israel Katz, responded to Mr. Guterres in a post on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Mr. Katz criticized the secretary general for suggesting Israel was to blame for the humanitarian situation in Gaza without also condemning Hamas and the United Nations for their roles, and for doing so ''without calling for the immediate, unconditional release of all Israeli hostages.''
  The visit to the border by Mr. Guterres came a day after a draft U.N. Security Council resolution, backed by the United States and calling for an ''immediate and sustained cease-fire in Gaza,'' failed to pass when Russia, China and Algeria voted against it at a meeting of the council in New York.
  The resolution, which included some of Washington's strongest language since the start of the war, was criticized by those who opposed it and others for not demanding a permanent end to the war. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, denounced the U.S.-backed measure before the vote, calling it a ''hypocritical initiative'' that did not do enough ''to save the lives of Palestinians.''
  In recent weeks, Israel and Hamas have held indirect talks -- mediated by Qatar and Egypt -- to try to reach a cease-fire deal. The proposal would also include the release of at least some of the more than 100 remaining hostages held by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, according to Israeli officials.
  Israel started its campaign in Gaza after a surprise attack led by Hamas on Oct. 7 that killed over 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, with more than 250 people taken hostage, according to Israeli officials. Five months later, more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to the Gaza health ministry, and wide areas of the enclave have been leveled.
  Israeli leaders have vowed to send ground troops into Rafah, the city in southern Gaza where about a million Palestinians have sought refuge from the fighting. President Biden expressed ''deep concerns'' over a major Israeli operation in Rafah during a phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel this week, according to the White House. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Friday that an assault on Rafah risked ''further isolating Israel around the world.''
  Israel says the operation is necessary to root out remaining Hamas fighters in the city. Mr. Netanyahu vowed on Friday that Israel would invade Rafah regardless of whether the United States backed the decision. ''I hope we will do it with the support of the U.S.,'' Mr. Netanyahu told Mr. Blinken, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. ''But if we must, we will do it alone.''
  Mr. Netanyahu said Israel would seek to evacuate civilians from combat areas. But U.N. officials like Mr. Guterres have warned that the potential offensive was still likely to have dire consequences.
  ''Any further onslaught will make things even worse,'' Mr. Guterres said. ''Worse for Palestinian civilians, worse for the hostages and worse for all people of the region.''

The Israeli airstrike this week in Damascus that killed seven Iranian commanders was an unusually harsh blow, and officials say Iran is determined to respond, raising fears of a war.
Follow live updates on the Israel-Hamas war and the Middle East crisis.
Iran vowed on Friday to avenge Israel’s killing of senior commanders and other officers of its elite Quds Force, at a public funeral held for the dead men, elevating fears of open war but leaving unsaid how it would retaliate or when.
U.S. officials in Washington and the Middle East said on Friday that they were bracing for possible Iranian retaliation for the Israeli airstrike on Monday in Damascus, Syria. U.S. military forces in the region have been placed on heightened alert. Israel has also placed its military on high alert, according to an Israeli official, canceled leave for combat units, recalled some reservists to air defense units and blocked GPS signals.
Two Iranian officials who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly said that Iran had placed all its armed forces on full high alert and that a decision had been made that Iran must respond directly to the Damascus attack to create deterrence.
“Our brave men will punish the Zionist regime,” Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander in chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, told the crowd in Tehran attending the funeral of the officers killed in Damascus. “We warn that no act by any enemy against our holy system will go unanswered and the art of the Iranian nation is to break the power of empires.”
The Israeli airstrike hit a building that was part of the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, killing three generals and four other officers of the Quds Force. The force, an arm of the Revolutionary Guards, conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran, often working closely with allies that oppose Israel and the United States, including Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas.
Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeed Iravani, said on Thursday that he would give interviews to U.S. news outlets “after Iran’s response to Israel.”
There are precedents for a forceful response by Iran. Four years ago, after the United States killed the chief of the Quds Force, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran fired missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq, injuring more than 100 troops.
Though its proxy militias around the Middle East have launched a number of attacks on Israel since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, Iran has taken care to avoid a direct conflict that could lead to full-fledged war.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, delivered a video speech that was broadcast in Iran and in Lebanon during the funeral, saying that a response from Iran could come any time and that “we must be prepared for all eventualities.”
“Be certain that the Iranian response to the targeting in Damascus is inevitably coming,” Mr. Nasrallah said.
In the past few months, Israel has killed at least 18 members of the Quds Force, among them four senior commanders who were veterans of Middle East wars, according to Iranian media. But the airstrike in Damascus was far out of the ordinary, both in killing so many senior figures at once and in hitting a diplomatic building, normally considered off limits in conflicts. Israeli officials said the building functioned as a Revolutionary Guards base and so was a legitimate target.
The building housed the official residence of Iran’s ambassador to Syria, who said on state television that he and his family had left the building when it was hit.
The final decision on a matter as important as a strike against Israel rests with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is also the commander in chief of the armed forces. It was Mr. Khamenei who ordered the 2020 attack in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani.
U.S. military analysts assess that it is more likely that Iran would strike Israel itself than that it would have its proxies attack U.S. troops in the region, including in Iraq and Syria, as they did more than 170 times in the four months after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 assault against Israel. Those attacks against American targets stopped in early February, but Pentagon officials said they were watching the situation closely.
An Israeli defense official said that Israeli analysts had reached the same conclusion, that Iran itself would attack and not act through Hezbollah, its closest militant ally, which has been engaging in regular exchanges of fire with Israeli forces since the war began.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, before a security cabinet meeting about a potential Iranian attack, said on Thursday, “We will know how to defend ourselves and we will act according to the simple principle of whoever harms us or plans to harm us — we will harm them.”
Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, the top U.S. Air Force commander in the Middle East, told the Defense Writers Group in Washington this week: “From a military perspective, the biggest concern that I have is, does this lead to some sort of regional escalation? We’re watching very carefully, we’re listening to what the Iranians are saying in terms of how they intend to respond.”
“I do continue to assess that the Iranians are not interested in a broader regional conflict,” he added. “They want to take advantage of the crisis as it exists, but they’re not interested in war with Israel, war with the United States or war with anybody else right now.”
The funeral ceremony in Tehran on Friday coincided with the annual Quds Day rally, a show of solidarity with Palestinians held on the last Friday of Ramadan in many Muslim countries. The crowd chanted, “Death to Israel,” and “Death to America,” and waved the Palestinian flag. In videos shown on state news media, an angry crowd stomped on an effigy of Mr. Netanyahu.
The Quds Day rally, held in many cities across Iran, draws families with children and usually has a carnival-like atmosphere. But this year, the event appeared to be more somber, overshadowed by the funeral, the heightened tensions with Israel and fears that a response from Iran could start a war between the two countries.
Iran’s president, Ibrahim Raisi, and the commander in chief of the Quds Force, General Ismail Ghaani, who was dressed in black civilian clothes rather than in uniform, marched with the crowd of mourners in Tehran, state media showed. Also present were Ziyad al-Nakhaleh, the leader of the Islamic Palestinian Jihad, and Abu Fadak al-Muhammadawi the head of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, a Shia militia aligned with Iran.
The coffins of the slain Quds Force officers, draped with the flag of Iran and placed on the back of trucks adorned with flowers and green leaves, slowly snaked down a long road in downtown Tehran, where thousands of people had gathered.
The night before, the coffins were taken to the residential compound of Mr. Khamenei, the supreme leader, and laid in an open hall where he performed the Muslim prayer for the dead over them. The ayatollah typically does such honors only for very close associates and senior officials who have been declared “martyrs” because they were killed by Israel or the United States.

Israel’s military did not immediately comment on the Syria strikes, but its defense minister said Israel would pursue Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia, “every place it operates.”
Airstrikes killed a number of soldiers near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo early Friday, Syria’s state news media and an independent organization reported, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group that tracks Syria’s civil war, said that the dead included 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from the pro-Iranian militias. The group said the attack appeared to have hit multiple targets, including a weapons depot belonging to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia that Iran supports and has a presence in Syria.
The airstrikes stoked fears that have unsettled Western officials for months: that Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza could escalate into a broader conflict against Syria, Iran and its proxies across the region, which could entangle allies of those involved, like Russia and the United States.
American officials have sought to tamp down tensions, and Iran has tried to rein in its network of militias after a drone fired by one of the groups killed three U.S. Army reservists in January. But fears of a wider conflict have persisted as Israel and Hezbollah have clashed for months along the border, and as Israel has carried out assaults on Iran-linked targets in Syria.
Israel’s military did not immediately comment on the Syria strikes on Friday, but its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, appeared to hint at responsibility.
“We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks,” he said on social media, promising more operations in Lebanon, Syria and “other more distant locations.”
Iran supports and arms a network of proxy militias that have been fighting with Israel, including Hamas, whose political leader was in Iran for high-level meetings this week. Attacks across the borders of Lebanon and Syria have escalated since Oct. 7, when Hamas led a sweeping raid into Israel and the country responded with an intense bombardment and later ground invasion of Gaza.
The Israeli military said this month that its forces had struck more than 4,500 Hezbollah targets in Syria and Lebanon since Oct. 7. The assaults, it said, had killed over 300 Hezbollah members, though that could not be independently confirmed. Hezbollah’s official website and spokesman said that “more than 200” of its fighters had been killed to date.
On Friday, Syria’s state-run official news agency, SANA, did not specify a death toll in what it identified as an Israeli attack. It said several civilians and soldiers had been killed or wounded in strikes on multiple locations near Aleppo around 1:45 a.m.
In a separate incident, the Lebanese state news media reported that an Israeli drone strike had targeted a car in southern Lebanon, killing at least one person.
The Israeli military confirmed that it had carried out that strike, which it said had killed the deputy commander of Hezbollah’s rocket and missile unit. Hezbollah acknowledged the death of the man, Ali Abdulhassan Naim, on Telegram but did not elaborate on the circumstances.
Mr. Gallant, the Israeli defense minister, praised the strike, calling it “another successful assassination of a Hezbollah commander.”
The Israeli military and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire across the border for months, displacing tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israelis from their homes.
On Thursday, the United Nations peacekeeping mission deployed along the border said in a statement that it was very concerned about the surge in violence, which has killed many civilians and destroyed homes and livelihoods.
Israel has come under increasing international pressure over the Gaza war in recent days: On Monday, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire, and on Thursday the top U.N. court ruled, in its sharpest language yet, that Israel must ensure the “unhindered delivery of assistance ” to Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Friday authorized a delegation to travel to Qatar and Egypt in the coming days for talks on a possible cease-fire. But it remained unclear whether Israel would reschedule another delegation’s trip to Washington, as the White House said it was trying to do, following Mr. Netanyahu’s decision to hold the team back in response to the U.S. abstention from the Security Council vote.
In response to the U.N. court ruling, Israel on Friday said it was committed to its legal obligations to provide aid to Gazan civilians, and that it would promote “new initiatives” to do so. Israel has endorsed a handful of aid efforts in the last month, including a ship carrying food from Cyprus, airdrops by foreign countries and crossings into northern Gaza by a small number of aid trucks.
But progress on the efforts to ramp up deliveries has been slow, and aid groups say the current level is not nearly sufficient to meet the vast need in the enclave.
Despite the growing pressure over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, Israeli leaders have vowed to keep pursuing their objective of destroying Hamas, in Gaza and outside it.
Israel has already targeted Hamas officials outside the territory, most notably assassinating Saleh al-Arouri, a top Hamas leader, in early January in an explosion in a Beirut suburb, according to officials from Hamas, Lebanon and the United States. Israel has not taken responsibility for his killing.
Since the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, Israel has conducted strikes and targeted killings in the country, which Israeli officials have said are aimed at crippling the military capabilities and supply lines for Iranian-backed proxy forces.
Throughout the war, Iran and Hezbollah have backed Syria’s authoritarian president, Bashar al-Assad, with fighters and military support. Israel views the influence and military buildup of these forces as a threat to its northern border.
In a further complication for Israel, Russia also supports Mr. al-Assad. Mr. Netanyahu needs the good will of President Vladimir V. Putin to help constrain Iran and continue to strike targets in Syria, while trying to avoid harming the forces Russia maintains there.
A spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, condemned the strikes on Friday, calling them “a gross violation” of Syria’s sovereignty and international law, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. The strikes, she said, were “fraught with extremely dangerous consequences” in context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Russia and Israel’s relations have already been strained by the war, and Mr. Putin has emerged as a vocal critic of Israel. His ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, told the Security Council last week that Russia was guided by “what is necessary for the Palestinian people and what helps to advance peace.”
Friday’s bombardment was at least the second deadly assault in Syria in less than a week. On Tuesday, airstrikes in eastern Syria killed several people. The Iranian state news media said that Israel was responsible, while Syria’s state news agency attributed it to American forces. A Pentagon spokeswoman denied that the United States had carried out the strikes.
The Tuesday strikes killed a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, according to Iranian state news media reports. An engineer with the World Health Organization was also killed in the strikes, the agency said.

The airstrike on an Iranian Embassy building was one of the biggest attacks yet in a shadow war that has increasingly been moving into the open.
At least three senior commanders and four officers overseeing Iran's covert operations in the Middle East were killed on Monday when Israeli warplanes struck a building in Damascus that is part of the Iranian Embassy complex, according to Iranian and Syrian officials. 
  The strike in Damascus, the Syrian capital, appeared to be among the deadliest attacks in a yearslong shadow war between Israel and Iran that has included the assassinations of Iranian military leaders and nuclear scientists.
  That covert war has moved into the open as tensions between the countries have intensified over Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip against Hamas, the Iranian-backed militia that led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
  Four Israeli officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, confirmed that Israel had been behind the strike in Damascus, but denied that the building had diplomatic status.
  But the Syrian ambassador to Iran, Shafiq Dayoub, said the strike had targeted a diplomatic building and was a ''clear and complete violation of all international conventions and norms.''
  Video circulating on social media after the strike showed a destroyed building next to the embassy, and photographs showed an entrance gate with a sign identifying it as the consular section. The embassy said on X that the building housed a consular section and the ambassador's residence.
  Footage broadcast by Iranian and Syrian news agencies showed a ruined building, burned cars, shattered glass and debris on the ground.
  The dead included Gen. Mohamad Reza Zahedi, 65, who oversaw Iran's covert military operations in Syria and Lebanon, two other generals and four officers in the Quds Force, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said in a statement.
  Ali Vaez, the Iran director for the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that seeks to prevent wars, said that targeting a diplomatic facility would be ''akin to targeting Iran on its own soil.''
  Israeli officials said the building was an outpost of the Revolutionary Guards, making it a legitimate military target.
  Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, strongly condemned the strike and said he had spoken to his Syrian counterpart about the ''Zionist regime's attack on the consulate section of the Islamic Republic's embassy in Damascus.''
  ''Netanyahu has lost his mental balance because he has faced back-to-back defeat in Gaza and has not achieved the Zionists' ambitious goals,'' Mr. Amir Abdollahian said in a statement, referring to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
  In Washington, officials expressed fears that the strike could escalate hostilities in the region. After the strike, American troops based in southern Syria knocked down a one-way attack drone, a U.S. Defense Department official said on Monday night. 
  It was the first attack aimed at U.S. troops in Iraq or Syria in nearly two months. No injuries or damage were reported, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
  The Damascus strike came as Israeli soldiers withdrew from Gaza's largest hospital complex, Al-Shifa, leaving it badly battered after a two-week raid in which the Israeli military said it had killed about 200 Palestinian militants and arrested hundreds of others after extended firefights.
  Dr. Taysir al-Tanna, a longtime vascular surgeon at the Gaza City hospital, said that many of the main buildings -- including the emergency, obstetrics and surgical wards -- had been badly damaged in the fighting and the main gate smashed.
  ''Now it looks like a wasteland,'' Dr. al-Tanna said.
  Osama al-Ashi, a Gazan who went to the area to check on his apartment after hearing that the Israeli military had withdrawn, said that he was immediately struck by the stench of decomposing bodies and that he had seen mountains of rubble and burned buildings.
  ''The whole time we were walking,'' he said, ''we were stepping on body parts.''
  Mr. al-Ashi said that many of the dead appeared to have been shot. Others, he said, appeared to have been unearthed when Israeli forces bulldozed temporary cemeteries on hospital grounds. Many buildings around the hospital had been destroyed by bombs, missiles and tank shells, he said.
  ''The scenes there were difficult to tolerate as a human being,'' he said. ''You feel like you are in a horror movie.''
  The Israeli military said that the Palestinians killed had been militants and that those who were arrested had been suspected militants, including some believed to be senior commanders of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It said two Israeli soldiers had been killed and eight others wounded in the raid.
  Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, blamed militants for the destruction at the hospital, saying they had fortified themselves in hospital wards, fired on soldiers and refused calls to surrender.
  ''We had to fire on the buildings in order to stop that and to kill the terrorists,'' he said.
  Israeli forces evacuated displaced civilians sheltering at the compound, as well as some patients, and placed other patients in a building away from the fighting, Admiral Hagari said.
  The World Health Organization said on Sunday that at least 21 patients had died since the Israeli raid began in mid-March, though the causes of death were unclear. By this weekend, 107 patients remained -- 30 of them bedridden -- without drinking water and with only minimal medication, the Gazan Health Ministry said in a statement.
  Israeli forces first raided Al-Shifa in November, maintaining that Hamas militants had built a command center in tunnels underneath it. Hamas and the hospital director said the facility was solely used as a refuge for civilians.
  The Israeli military later publicized some evidence to support its case, including by showing reporters a fortified tunnel constructed underneath the hospital grounds. An investigation by The New York Times found that the evidence suggested that Hamas had used the site for cover and stored weapons there.
  After little more than a week, Israeli troops withdrew in compliance with a brief cease-fire. But after the fighting resumed, Israeli forces closed in on the hospital again in March in an attempt to root out what they said was a renewed insurgency by armed groups in northern Gaza.
  ''Hamas and Islamic Jihad have started to rebuild themselves in the north,'' said Admiral Hagari. ''And they re-based themselves inside Shifa.''
  Hamas called the destruction at the hospital ''a horrific crime'' and said Israel had perpetrated it ''with full and unlimited support from the administration of U.S. President Biden.''
  In a visit to Al-Shifa on Saturday, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military chief of staff, declared the raid ''extremely successful'' and said it had showed militant groups that ''a hospital is not a safe place'' for them.
  Israeli officials and a member of the Revolutionary Guards, which oversee the Quds Force, said the Damascus strike on Monday had targeted a meeting in which Iranian intelligence officials and Palestinian militants were to discuss the war in Gaza. Among them were leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a group armed and funded by Iran.
  Syria's defense ministry said the Israeli strike occurred about 5 p.m. local time, when fighter jets entered Syria from the Golan Heights.
  The attack came days after airstrikes killed soldiers near the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, Syria's state news media and an independent organization reported, in what appeared to be one of the heaviest Israeli attacks in the country in years.
  Those strikes on Friday killed 36 Syrian soldiers, seven Hezbollah fighters and a Syrian from a pro-Iranian militia, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that tracks Syria's civil war.
  Israel's military did not comment after those strikes, but its defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said, ''We will pursue Hezbollah every place it operates, and we will expand the pressure and the pace of the attacks.'' He promised more operations in Lebanon, Syria and ''other more distant locations.''
  The U.S. Defense Department official did not say who was behind the drone attack Monday on Al Tanf base in southern Syria. Iran-backed militias have fired rockets, missiles and drones at U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria more than 170 times since November, but none since early February.
  Three U.S. service members were killed in Jordan, and at least 34 others injured, in a Jan. 28 drone attack by an Iran-backed militia, the first known American military fatalities from hostile fire in the turmoil spilling over from Israel's war with Hamas.
  Ten days later, a U.S. Special Operations retaliatory drone strike in Baghdad killed a senior leader of a militia that American officials blame for the attacks on American personnel.

In Hezbollah’s Sights, a Stretch of Northern Israel Becomes a No-Go Zone

Highlight: For the few Israelis remaining in the evacuated zone along the northern border with Lebanon, the simmering conflict there has become intensely personal.
Body


More than 60,000 Israelis who live far from Gaza but close to the front line of another spiraling conflict have in recent months been ordered from their homes along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon — the first mass evacuation of the area in Israeli history.
In one Israeli border town, antitank missiles fired from Lebanon have damaged scores of homes. In another village, holdouts who refuse to evacuate said they avoided turning lights on at night to keep from becoming visible targets. And in a sign of the proximity of the fighters across the border and how personal the simmering hostilities have become, a farmer said he had received a text message claiming to be from Hezbollah and threatening him with death.
The evacuations and an effort in Lebanon to move thousands of civilians away from the border are the result of an intensifying conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia and political organization.
The skirmish along Israel’s northern border is being fought in parallel with the more intense war in Gaza, which Israel launched after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. Now also in its sixth month, the battle with Hezbollah has implications both for the prospects of a wider regional conflict and for the thousands of civilians who live along the frontier.
Israel has responded forcefully to Hezbollah’s attacks: Above the hills and valleys of Israel’s border with Lebanon, Israeli warplanes rumble overhead. In the recent fighting, at least eight civilians in Israel and at least 51 in Lebanon have been killed, according to the Israeli and Lebanese authorities, as have combatants on both sides.
A recent two-day trip through the Galilee Panhandle — a finger of Israeli territory that juts into Lebanon — and west toward the Mediterranean coast revealed a mostly abandoned landscape stalked by fear and overtaken by nature. This stretch of Israel has become a virtual no-go zone, even to families who have lived in the area for generations. Military checkpoints block access to communities within a mile or so of the frontier, and daily life is frozen in a state of anxious suspension.
Residents of the region are split over whether the government was right to order an evacuation. Some say it showed weakness and effectively handed Hezbollah a victory. Others say it has saved countless lives.
Chaim Amedi, 82, a resident of Kfar Yuval, a now mostly deserted village barely a mile from Lebanon, has refused to abandon the town his parents founded in the 1950s and evacuate to a hotel. “You don’t leave a home,” he said, adding that “hotels are for vacations.”
Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Shiite group that is better armed and organized than its Hamas allies in Gaza, began firing across the border after Oct. 7. The attacks have been big enough to demonstrate the group’s solidarity with Hamas, but measured enough so far to prevent provoking an all-out conflict with Israel.
Some days, Hezbollah has fired up to 100 short-range rockets. Israel, in turn, has struck targets up to 60 miles inside Lebanon.
In Kiryat Shmona, normally an Israeli city of about 24,000, about 1,500 inhabitants remain. Many residents, now scattered among 220 hotels across Israel, did not even wait for the government’s order on Oct. 20 to evacuate.
The town’s banks and malls are closed. The start-up companies at the city’s burgeoning food-technology hub have left. Only one eatery is open — a modest shawarma and falafel joint catering mainly to soldiers.
Toby Abutbul, 22, the son of the owner, showed reporters video footage of what he said were two anti-tank missiles landing in front of him last month as he drove on the city’s main road. An air-raid siren sounded only after the missiles struck. A nearby woman and her teenage son were severely wounded, according to the local authorities.
Israel’s Iron Dome system can intercept many types of rockets, which fly in high arcs and are difficult to aim, but nowadays, Hezbollah also fires rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank missiles. Israel has no immediate answer for such weapons, which allow for more precise line-of-sight targeting, fly low to the ground and hit targets in seconds and without warning.
Hezbollah’s use of those weapons means there is no time to run to a shelter, said Ariel Frish, the deputy security manager for Kiryat Shmona. If anything happens, the instructions are to hit the ground wherever you are.
Itay and Niv Tamir, a couple in their 30s, returned home in late January with their sons, ages 1 and 4, to the border community of Kibbutz HaGoshrim.
They risked returning, they said, in part because their house is not in the direct line of sight from Lebanon. Nevertheless, the boys sleep in a bombproof safe room.
“We try not to let the fear control us,” Ms. Tamir said. But, she added, the family rarely ventures far outdoors given that much of the kibbutz is within view of villages in Lebanon.
An anti-tank missile in December crashed through an auditorium in Kibbutz Sasa, according to the military and local officials. Hezbollah has also employed exploding drones, with which they have struck an army base, according to the group and the military.
Israeli government and military officials say they are considering military action to push Hezbollah back from the border unless a diplomatic effort can achieve the same result first. In the meantime, the death toll on both sides is rising.
This month, the Israeli military said that its air and ground forces had struck more than 4,500 Hezbollah targets in both Lebanon and neighboring Syria since Oct. 7, and that they had killed more than 300 Hezbollah operatives. Hezbollah’s official website and spokesman said that “more than 200” of its fighters had been killed to date.
Fourteen Israeli soldiers have been killed in the north so far, according to the Israeli authorities.
For decades, Israel’s northern towns and villages were targets for militants based in Lebanon. Armed Palestinian groups infiltrated the border in the 1970s and 1980s, entering homes, hijacking buses and taking schoolchildren hostage. The city of Kiryat Shmona, in the Galilee Panhandle, was plagued by Katyusha rocket fire and was long a symbol of Israeli resilience.
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and left in 2000. During Israel’s long occupation, Lebanese villagers crossed the border daily to work on Israeli farms and in the towns of the Galilee.
Even during the worst battles of the past, including a devastating, monthlong war with Hezbollah in 2006, Israel never formally evacuated the border towns.
Since that war ended, residents say they have seen fighters who appear to be from Hezbollah’s elite Radwan forces monitoring them through the border fence, violating a United Nations-backed cease-fire that ended the war and was meant to establish a demilitarized zone.
“They studied each community, studied us personally, our routines, our places of employment, waiting for an opportunity,” said Eitan Davidi, 53, a farmer from Margaliot, a small village abutting the border. “They know when I come, when I go. They know my kids.”
In January, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military’s spokesman, said at a news conference that Radwan fighters were operating along the border.
Mr. Davidi, who produces chicken eggs and owns fruit orchards, said the war became particularly personal after he gave interviews to the Israeli news media in which he said Lebanese border villages harboring Hezbollah fighters should be razed — “Not on their heads,” he said, clarifying that he was referring only to the buildings.
First, he said, he received a threatening WhatsApp message reminding him in Hebrew that his chicken coops had already been hit twice. “We won’t miss the target a third time,” the message read. It was signed Hezbollah. The New York Times, which viewed the message, could not independently confirm its origin.
Next came a social media post from a correspondent for Al Manar, Hezbollah’s television channel, calling Mr. Davidi the “mule” of Margaliot. The post included images of gunmen on the Lebanese side of the border with Mr. Davidi’s village, his chicken coops and home visible in the background.
Missiles and rockets have since incinerated most of his coops. One exploded in his backyard. An anti-tank missile fired into Margaliot on March 4 killed a farm laborer from India and injured seven more foreign workers, according to the Israeli military.
Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have also blamed Israel for targeting civilians across the border. Last month, after a family was killed in an Israeli strike, Najib Mikati, Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, accused Israel of “killing and targeting of innocent children, women, and older adults.” After the same attack, Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, vowed Israel would “pay the price of spilling their blood.”
A sixth-generation farmer from Metula, Tal Levit, 45, who now serves in the military reserves as a member of the town’s emergency response team, said his home had also been struck by Hezbollah.
Speaking at a rest stop south of Metula, he said he had seen people on the Lebanese side of the fence monitoring the town. “Some were half in uniform, or were dressed as shepherds,” he said. “They were photographing, preparing.”
In the summer months, he said, the leaves of a pecan tree obscure his house from prying eyes, but the winter left it exposed. Generally, Mr. Levit has been careful not to go home wearing his military uniform. But one day last month, he entered his house to do laundry and have a cup of coffee. An hour after he left, a missile penetrated the roof and exploded inside, he said.
On the approach to Kfar Yuval, a faded road sign reads, “Border Ahead.” A mother and her son, who was a member of the village’s armed response team, were killed in January when an anti-tank rocket struck their home on the edge of the village, according to the Israeli military.
Along the village pathways, orange trees are heavy with unpicked fruit. The top half of a children’s plastic slide emerges from the green sea of an overgrown lawn. Most of the houses are shuttered.
The silence one recent afternoon was broken by a long series of booms.
It was hard to tell who was firing on whom.

Body


After several days during which Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei repeatedly vowed that “the evil Zionist regime” would be punished for its April 1 attack on Iran’s embassy complex in Damascus that killed seven Iranian military advisers, including three top commanders, the Islamic Republic struck. More than 300 drones and missiles launched from Iranian soil took aim at Israel on Saturday. Nearly all of them were intercepted, mainly by Israeli or American defenses, with a report of just one Israeli casualty, a girl from a Bedouin community wounded by shrapnel.
Will that be the end of it?
It’s no secret that Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for decades. The weekend attack is notable for two reasons: its directness and its ineffectuality. Iranian military commanders undoubtedly understood that most of their slow-moving drones, about 170 in all, would be shot down before reaching their targets. They were a diversion. Those commanders were probably more surprised that their 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles also did negligible damage.
That should drive home a clear lesson to Iran’s leaders: They are no technological match for the Jewish state, especially when the United States is lending a hand. If Israel decides to respond to the attack with direct strikes on Iran — perhaps against oil installations, nuclear sites or military infrastructure — it isn’t likely to miss its targets.
As I write this, Israel’s cabinet is debating that question. As a matter of self-defense, Israel has every moral and legal right to respond in kind — and then some. It is not enough for Israel to demonstrate its capacity for defense, as it did over the weekend. It must also re-establish its capacity for deterrence. That is, it needs to show Iran’s leaders that the price for bringing their war against Israel out of the shadows will be unbearably high, and is therefore not to be repeated.
But if right is one consideration, prudence is another.
Israel has an unfinished war against Hamas in Gaza, and a direct Israeli attack on Iran could trigger a second full-scale war against Hezbollah in Lebanon, if not with Iran itself. Most Israelis understand that particular war will have to be fought sooner or later — perhaps before the end of the summer — and that it will be probably much tougher on them than the Gaza war has been so far.
But war with Hezbollah will demand two things: the full concentration of Israel’s fighting capacity and sustained support from the United States.
Iran’s attack, and the Biden administration’s laudable participation in Israel’s defense, is an opportunity for Benjamin Netanyahu to mend frayed ties in Washington and other Western capitals by showing restraint. Among other things, it can help move the House of Representatives finally to vote for the Ukraine-Israel military assistance package that the Senate approved in February. It also buys Israel time to destroy what remains of Hamas’s military forces in Gaza.
An Israeli attack now would lack an additional advantage — the element of surprise. It isn’t just Israel’s technology that is superior to Iran’s. It’s also its intelligence, the kind that has been on display with Israeli hits on Iran’s top nuclear scientist, senior commanders and the spectacular 2018 heist of its secret nuclear dossiers. The clandestine nature of the warfare has helped to keep Tehran paranoid, vulnerable, and guessing. It’s the sort of place where a wise nation wants its enemy to be.
None of this is to say that Israel should simply stand down.
Israel will find opportunities to hit its enemy where it hurts, at a time of its choosing. So, of course, will Iran — but Iran would do that anyway. Israel’s diplomatic facilities have always been vulnerable to Iranian attack, as have civilian Jewish targets. We were reminded of it again on Thursday, when an Argentine court finally held Iran responsible for the 1994 attack on a Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people and injured hundreds.
Nor is it to say that Israel doesn’t deserve President Biden’s full support if it chooses to retaliate for Saturday’s attack. The Ayatollah Khamenei surely noted the friction between Israel and the West over Gaza when he ordered the strike; daylight between Israel and the United States is often an invitation to mischief by the common enemies of both. The president has political reasons to avoid another full-scale regional war in an election year. But the best way to avert such a war is to leave Tehran with no illusions that it could separate Israel from the United States by starting one.
The key decisions of the past half-century that have driven the Middle East to the place it is in today have a common origin: Iran’s Islamic Revolution of 1979, which brought to power a theocratic despotism intent on sowing fanaticism, brutalizing its own people, destroying Israel and causing misery across the region for the sake of its ideological aims. Saturday’s missile attack is the latest example of a long and ugly record. But as Israelis decide how to react, they would serve their interests best by recalling the useful adage that revenge is a dish best served cold.

Experts say Tehran does not want a broader war. But it is far from clear whether Iran or Israel will choose to escalate a conflict that has become more direct and out of the shadows.
Iran has retaliated directly against Israel for the killings of its senior generals in Damascus, Syria, with an onslaught of more than 300 drones and missiles aimed at restoring its credibility and deterrence, officials and analysts say.
That represents a moment of great risk, with key questions still to answer, they say. Has Iran’s attack been enough to satisfy its calls for revenge? Or given the relatively paltry results — almost all of the drones and missiles were intercepted by Israel and the United States — will it feel obligated to strike again? And will Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, see the strong performance by his country’s air defenses as a sufficient response? Or will he choose to escalate further with an attack on Iran itself?
Now that Iran has attacked Israel as it promised to do, it will want to avoid a broader war, the officials and analysts say, noting that the Iranians targeted only military sites in an apparent effort to avoid civilian casualties and advertised their attack well in advance.
“Iran’s government appears to have concluded that the Damascus strike was a strategic inflection point, where failure to retaliate would carry more downsides than benefits,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. “But in doing so, the shadow war it has been waging with Israel for years now threatens to turn into a very real and very damaging conflict,” one that could drag in the United States, he said.
“The Iranians have for now played their card,” said Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. “They made a choice to call Israel’s bluff, and they felt they needed to do so, because they see the last six months as a persistent effort to set them back across the region.”
On Sunday, Iranian leaders said the military operation against Israel was over, but warned that they could launch a bigger one depending on Israel’s response.
Brig. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Iran’s top military officer, said the “operation yielded its complete result” and “there is no intention to continue it.” But, he added, if Israel attacked Iran on its own soil, or elsewhere, “our next operation will be much bigger than this.”
For years, Iran took blow after blow from Israel: assassinations of its nuclear scientists and military commanders, explosions at its nuclear and military bases, cyberattacks, intelligence infiltrations, an embarrassing theft of nuclear documents and recent attacks on its critical infrastructure.
But since the Hamas-led assault of Oct. 7 prompted Israel to go to war in Gaza, Israel has intensified its attacks on Iranian interests and commanders in Syria. In a series of strikes from December onward, Israel has assassinated at least 18 Iranian commanders and military personnel from the Quds Force, the elite unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that operates outside Iran’s borders, Iranian media said.
Iran’s government has been criticized by hard-liner supporters for its cautious posture during the war in Gaza.
With the attacks this weekend, Ms. Vakil said: “I think Tehran saw a need to draw this red line and make it clear to Israel that Iran does have red lines and would not continue to tolerate the slow degradation of its position.”
Tehran felt it had to respond, even if its attack prompted firm American backing and widespread Western diplomatic support for Israel, taking some of the heat off Israel over its war in Gaza, at least temporarily, and again isolated Iran.
Now, Ms. Vakil said, the two sides were in a standoff in which both were prepared for escalation despite knowing it would cause huge damage to themselves.
At the same time, the old equation has changed, with Israel and Iran hitting each other directly, on each other’s territory, and not through Iranian proxies abroad.
The Israeli strike on Iran’s Embassy compound in Damascus, followed by a direct Iranian strike on Israel, represents a dangerous new chapter in the long, sometimes hidden war between Israel and Iran, which has said it wants Israel to be wiped off the map. Sometimes known as “the shadow war,” the conflict has been carried out mainly between Israel and Iran’s allies and proxies — in Gaza, southern Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Syria.
Both sides claim they are acting in national self-defense — Israel against groups committed to its destruction, with Iran as their prime ally and controller, and Iran against any potential Israeli war against it, often in the name of the Palestinians.
Iran increasingly refers to its rapidly expanding nuclear program, which has enriched uranium to near weapons-grade, as a deterrent against Israel, while at the same time denying that it has any intention of building a nuclear weapon. But increasingly Iran is considered by experts as a nuclear-threshold state, able to create weapons-grade nuclear material within weeks and a crude nuclear weapon within a year or so.
Iran is also going through a slow and complicated transition as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader and commander in chief, is said to be ailing and faced a 2022 domestic uprising, led by women, that demanded an end to clerical rule.
Mr. Khamenei himself ordered the strikes on Israel from inside Iran to send a clear message that Iran was shifting from “strategic patience” to a more active deterrence, according to four Iranian officials, two of them members of the Revolutionary Guards. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
“Iran’s operation has a crystal-clear message to Israel and its allies that the rules of the game have changed and from now on, if Israel strikes any Iranian targets or kills any Iranians, we are willing to strike in a big way and from our own soil,” Nasser Imani, a prominent analyst based in Tehran who is close to the government, said in a telephone interview. “The days of covert operations and patience are over.”
Iran also wanted to seize what it viewed as a “golden opportunity” to retaliate at this scale, because Israel was being so widely criticized over Gaza, including by its key allies, like the United States, Mr. Imani said.
Iran’s reach for regional hegemony, enhanced by its proxies and its nuclear abilities, has antagonized the traditional Sunni Arab governments of the region, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Gulf nations. The Islamic Revolution that overthrew the monarchy in 1979 was at its start aimed at regional revolution, overthrowing these governments, most of which are monarchies or military dictatorships, so Israel’s efforts to limit the power of Iran, a non-Arab Shiite nation, have had quiet support from Arab countries, including Israel’s war against Hamas.
Now the risks of regional escalation have gone up considerably. Iran has been careful during the war in Gaza to restrain its proxies surrounding Israel against major strikes, and to avoid major Israeli retaliation against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon in particular. Hezbollah, with its many thousands of rockets aimed at Israel, is considered a major deterrent preventing Israel from directly attacking Iran and especially its nuclear and missile program.
Given Iran’s new isolation after this attack, Israel should not respond, said Bruno Tertrais, the deputy director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. “But a threshold has been crossed,” he said. And the threshold for “a massive Israeli attack on Iranian territory,” he continued, “always an extreme option for Israel whatever the commentators say — is now lowered.”
Mr. Netanyahu, who has been warning of the threat from Iran for two decades and faces severe pressure to respond from within his shaky far-right coalition, may choose to riposte with more force, either at Iran directly or at Hezbollah. But Washington, not having been warned of the Damascus attack, is likely to insist on prior consultation now.
But the modest outcome of the Iranian attacks “may strengthen an Israeli perception that Tehran is on the back foot, lacking the willpower and capacity for deeper engagement, and that now is the moment for Israel to inflict a long sought after deeper blow on Iran and its regional proxies,” said Julien Barnes-Dacey, the director of Middle East and North Africa for the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Israel’s challenge was always “to thwart the main thrust of the attack while still leaving an opening that will enable the Iranians to say that they achieved their goal,” wrote Nahum Barnea, a commentator for Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli daily. The danger is from the two extremes, he continued: “An overly successful Iranian operation is liable to devolve into a regional war; an overly failed Iranian operation will invite another Iranian operation.”
Iran’s mission to the United Nations suggested in a statement on social media on Saturday that if Israel does not respond, Iran would stand down.
“The matter can be deemed concluded. However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran’s response will be considerably more severe,” the statement said. It also warned that “the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY!”

Iran launched more than 200 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles toward Israel on Saturday evening, the Israeli military said, in retaliation for a deadly Israeli airstrike on the Iranian Embassy complex in the Syrian capital this month.
The attack, which is believed to be the first direct Iranian assault inside Israel, threatened to open a volatile chapter in the long-running shadow war between the two nations. 
  The Israeli military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said at a news briefing that the strikes had caused minor damage to an Israeli military base. The vast majority of Iran's arsenal, he added, had been intercepted by Israel with ''some assistance'' from its allies.
  ''Only one little girl has been hurt,'' he said, without giving further details.
  But Admiral Hagari called Iran's strikes ''a severe and dangerous escalation.'' He added, ''Our defensive and offensive capabilities are at the highest level of readiness ahead of this large-scale attack from Iran.''
  Air-raid sirens sounded across Israel, loud booms were heard across Jerusalem and in the Golan Heights, and a video showed what appear to be Israeli air-defense interceptors in the sky above the Old City of Jerusalem.
  President Biden cut short a weekend trip to his vacation home in Delaware and returned to the White House to huddle with his national security team over the situation. A Defense Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters, said U.S. forces were helping to shoot down Iranian drones, without providing more details.
  ''In accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's security, U.S. forces in the region continue to shoot down Iranian-launched drones targeting Israel,'' the Defense Department official said.
  Britain's defense secretary, Grant Shapps, said in a statement that additional British jets and air refueling tankers had been deployed to bolster the country's existing operations in Iraq and Syria, and its jets would ''intercept'' airborne attacks within range of its missions there.
  Before the drones and missiles arrived, two Israeli officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military intelligence said the targets were likely to be the Golan Heights and an Israeli air force base in the Negev Desert.
  Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon, announced that it had also fired dozens of rockets at Israeli barracks in the Golan Heights, a plateau on Israel's northeast border with Syria and Lebanon that has been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War in 1967.
  Hezbollah and Israel have been firing at each other ever since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by another Iranian proxy group, Hamas, that led to the war in Gaza.
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel met with his war cabinet, according to his office. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Israel's minister of defense, Yoav Gallant, on Saturday and made clear that Israel could count on full U.S. support to defend itself, said the Pentagon's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder.
  The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is responsible for securing Iran's borders, said in a statement that it had launched ''dozens'' of drones and missiles toward Israel ''in reaction to the Zionist regime's crimes.'' The Guards said in a later statement that they had hit military targets in Israel, warned the United States against getting involved and threatened more strikes if Iran or its interests were hit.
  ''We warn the United States terrorist government that any support or participation in attacking Iran's interests will have a fierce response from Iran's Armed Forces,'' the statement said, warning Iran's neighbors that if Iran were attacked from their territory, Iran would respond.
  The strikes on Saturday came after a week of diplomacy and uncertainty about how far Iran would go in response to the Israeli attack in Damascus, the Syrian capital, on April 1 and whether it would risk starting an outright war with Israel. Senior Iranian officials and military commanders had vowed to retaliate after the airstrike in Damascus, which killed three top Iranian commanders and four officers.
  ''We will make them regret this crime and similar crimes, with the help of God,'' Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared after the strike.
  The United States, Israel and Iran all placed their militaries on high alert after the Damascus attack. The head of U.S. Central Command also traveled to Israel in anticipation of an Iranian strike. The question was not so much whether Iran would retaliate, but how and when.
  Iran's mission to the United Nations said on social media that the attack on Israel was in line with the U.N. charter of legitimate self-defense and suggested that the standoff with Israel could end if it did not attack in response.
  ''The matter can be deemed concluded,'' the mission said. ''However, should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Iran's response will be considerably more severe.''
  The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, strongly condemned Iran's attacks and urged all parties ''to exercise maximum restraint'' to avoid further military escalation in the Middle East. ''I have repeatedly stressed that neither the region nor the world can afford another war,'' he said in a statement.
  The U.N. Security Council said it would hold an emergency meeting on Sunday afternoon to discuss Iran's attacks on Israel, said Malta's U.N. mission, which holds the rotating presidency to the U.N. Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, had requested the Council session.
  Iran's attack came on the same day that its forces seized a container ship with links to Israel in the Persian Gulf. Adrienne Watson, a National Security Council spokeswoman, called on Iran to release the vessel and its crew immediately, calling it ''a blatant violation of international law.''
  In anticipation of Iran's counterattack, neighboring Jordan and Lebanon temporarily closed their airspace, as did Israel.
  The Israeli military said all schools would be closed across the country and gatherings of more than 1,000 people limited from 11 p.m. Saturday to 11 p.m. on Monday. The Israeli authorities also ordered residents of the Golan Heights, some areas of the Negev, and Eilat to remain close to protected shelters.
  Zaki Heller, a spokesman for Magen David Adom, an Israeli emergency response service, said by phone that medics treated a 10-year-old girl who was believed to have been wounded in the head by shrapnel in the Negev Desert and was in serious condition. About 20 other people were treated for anxiety or injuries suffered while seeking shelter, the group added.
  France on Saturday condemned ''in the strongest possible terms'' the Iranian strike on Israel. ''By taking such an unprecedented action, Iran has crossed a new threshold in its destabilizing actions, and runs the risk of military escalation,'' Stéphane Séjourné, France's foreign minister, said on X.
  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada also said in a statement: ''We stand with Israel. After supporting Hamas' brutal October 7 attack, the Iranian regime's latest actions will further destabilize the region and make lasting peace more difficult.''
  Tehran was split over how to respond after the Israeli strike in Damascus, a significant move between the two adversaries. Divisions over possible retaliation arose at an emergency meeting of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, three Iranians familiar with the deliberations said.
  Arguing that anything short of a direct response would be taken for weakness, some hard-line members said Iran should strike targets in Israel. Other Iranian officials called for continuing the policy of ''strategic patience'' and to retaliate through its proxy militias in the Middle East, the three Iranians said.
  The Revolutionary Guards said on Saturday that the attack on Israel had been ordered by Iran's Supreme National Security Council, under the guidance of the senior military body that coordinates Iran's armed forces.
  The Israeli airstrike on April 1 targeted high-ranking members of the Revolutionary Guards unit that oversees covert operations in the Mideast, the Quds Force. Among those killed was the top commander for the region, Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi.
  The death of General Zahedi was described as particularly stunning to Iranian leaders. Their outrage was not just over the blow to their military leadership, but also over the decision by the Israelis to strike the embassy complex.
  Diplomatic buildings are generally viewed as off-limits. But Israeli officials denied that the building had diplomatic status and the protections that would go with it.
  Amid the attack on Saturday, Iranians flocked to gas stations in the middle of the night, forming miles-long lines in Tehran and other big cities, videos posted on social media showed. The Ministry of Petroleum reassured the public that there was no shortage of gasoline and no need to fill up tanks.
  On social media, supporters of Iran's government cheered the attacks as a ''fierce slap'' against Israel. ''If the Zionist regime strikes Iran in the future, it will be severely punished,'' Seyed Mohammad Marandi, an adviser to Iran's nuclear negotiating team and Foreign Ministry, said in a post on X.
  On Saturday, Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group, a nonprofit that works on preventing and resolving deadly conflict, said in an interview that ''Iran and Israel are taking the region into uncharted waters.''
  He added, ''It is difficult to overstate how perilous this moment is, and how disastrous its consequences could prove.''

Even a conservative assessment of the reported Gaza casualty figures shows that the rate of death during Israel’s assault has few precedents in this century, experts say.
Israel has cast the deaths of civilians in the Gaza Strip as a regrettable but unavoidable part of modern conflict, pointing to the heavy human toll from military campaigns the United States itself once waged in Iraq and Syria.
But a review of past conflicts and interviews with casualty and weapons experts suggest that Israel’s assault is different.
While wartime death tolls will never be exact, experts say that even a conservative reading of the casualty figures reported from Gaza shows that the pace of death during Israel’s campaign has few precedents in this century.
People are being killed in Gaza more quickly, they say, than in even the deadliest moments of U.S.-led attacks in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, which were themselves widely criticized by human rights groups.
Precise comparisons of war dead are impossible, but conflict-casualty experts have been taken aback at just how many people have been reported killed in Gaza — most of them women and children — and how rapidly.
It is not just the scale of the strikes — Israel said it had engaged more than 15,000 targets before reaching a brief cease-fire in recent days. It is also the nature of the weaponry itself.
Israel’s liberal use of very large weapons in dense urban areas, including U.S.-made 2,000-pound bombs that can flatten an apartment tower, is surprising, some experts say.
“It’s beyond anything that I’ve seen in my career,” said Marc Garlasco, a military adviser for the Dutch organization PAX and a former senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon. To find a historical comparison for so many large bombs in such a small area, he said, we may “have to go back to Vietnam, or the Second World War.”
In fighting during this century, by contrast, U.S. military officials often believed that the most common American aerial bomb — a 500-pound weapon — was far too large for most targets when battling the Islamic State in urban areas like Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria.
The Israeli military points out that Gaza presents a battlefield like few others. It is small and dense, with civilians living next to, and even on top of, Hamas combatants who rely on tunnel networks to shield themselves and their weapons, putting residents directly in the line of fire, the military says.
Given these underground networks — which the military says enabled Hamas to wage its deadly attacks on Oct. 7 — Israeli forces say they use the “smallest available ordnance” to achieve their strategic objectives in order to cause the “minimal adverse effect on civilians.”
Civilian casualties are notoriously hard to calculate, and officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip do not separate the deaths of civilians and combatants.
Researchers point instead to the roughly 10,000 women and children reported killed in Gaza as an approximate — though conservative — measure of civilian deaths in the territory. International officials and experts familiar with the way figures are compiled by health officials in Gaza say the overall numbers are generally reliable.
The Israeli military acknowledged that children, women and older people have been killed in Gaza, but said the death toll reported in Gaza could not be trusted because the territory is run by Hamas. The military did not provide a count of its own, but said that civilians “are not the target” of its campaign.
“We do a lot in order to prevent and, where possible, minimize the killing or wounding of civilians,” said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman. “We focus on Hamas.”
Still, researchers say the pace of deaths reported in Gaza during the Israeli bombardment has been exceptionally high.
More women and children have been reported killed in Gaza in less than two months than the roughly 7,700 civilians documented as killed by U.S. forces and their international allies in the entire first year of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to estimates from Iraq Body Count, an independent British research group.
And the number of women and children reported killed in Gaza since the Israeli campaign began last month has already started to approach the roughly 12,400 civilians documented to have been killed by the United States and its allies in Afghanistan during nearly 20 years of war, according to Neta C. Crawford, a University of Oxford professor who is co-director of Brown University’s Costs of War Project.
These comparisons are based on the thousands of deaths directly attributed to U.S. coalition forces over decades in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Far more people — hundreds of thousands in total — are estimated to have been killed in these conflicts by other groups, including the Syrian government and its allies, local militias, the Islamic State and the Iraqi security forces.
But while the overall death tolls in those wars were larger, the number of people killed in Gaza “in a very short period of time is higher than in other conflicts,” said Professor Crawford, who has extensively researched modern wars.
In the nine-month battle of Mosul, which Israeli officials have cited as a comparison, an estimated total of 9,000 to 11,000 civilians were killed by all sides in the conflict, including many thousands killed by the Islamic State, The Associated Press found.
A similar number of women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza in less than two months.
The bombs being used in Gaza are larger than what the United States used when it was fighting ISIS in cities like Mosul and Raqqa, and are more consistent with targeting underground infrastructure like tunnels, said Brian Castner, a weapons investigator for Amnesty International and a former explosive ordnance disposal officer in the U.S. Air Force.
More than twice as many women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza than have been confirmed killed in Ukraine, according to United Nations figures, after almost two years of Russian attacks. (The United Nations believes the true toll in Ukraine is considerably higher, however, and Ukrainian officials have estimated that more than 20,000 civilians died in the port city of Mariupol.)
Not only is Gaza tiny when compared with conflict zones like Ukraine, Afghanistan or Iraq, but the territory’s borders have also been closed by Israel and Egypt, giving civilians few, if any, safe places to flee.
More than 60,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the Gaza Strip, satellite analysis indicates, including about half of the buildings in northern Gaza.
“They are using extremely large weapons in extremely densely populated areas,” Mr. Castner said of Israeli forces. “It is the worst possible combination of factors.”
A War ‘for Our Existence’
Israeli officials say their campaign is focused on degrading Gazan military infrastructure that is often built near homes and civilian institutions — or buried underneath them.
“To get to that target,” Colonel Conricus said, the military has to use “larger bombs with a higher yield.”
When an Israeli government spokesman, Mark Regev, was asked in an Oct. 24 interview with PBS about the pace of the strikes, he said Israel was aiming for a shorter campaign than the United States waged in Iraq and Syria.
“Hopefully, we get it done quicker,” Mr. Regev said. “That’s one of our goals. But it could take longer than many Israelis would hope, because Hamas has been in power for 16 years.”
Israel has directed Gaza residents to evacuate areas where the bombing campaign is especially concentrated, but it has continued to strike other areas as well.
More broadly, Israeli officials say this is a campaign on its own borders to wipe out Hamas, a group dedicated to Israel’s destruction. “The war here is for our existence,” one Israeli war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, told reporters on Nov. 8.
The brutality of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 traumatized Israelis, and some prominent members of the Israeli government have made clear that they are waging a ferocious campaign.
“Gaza won’t return to what it was before. Hamas will no longer exist. We will eliminate everything,” Yoav Gallant, Israel’s defense minister, said in the days after the Hamas raids.
After initially questioning the death toll in Gaza, the Biden administration now concedes that the true figures for casualties may be even worse.
Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told a House committee this month that American officials thought the casualties were “very high, frankly, and it could be that they’re even higher than are being cited.”
International experts who have worked with the Gaza Health Ministry during this and other wars say that it gathers death figures from hospitals and morgues across the enclave, which tally the dead and report the names, ID numbers and other details of people killed.
While the experts urged caution around public statements about the specific number of people killed in a particular strike — especially in the immediate aftermath of a blast — they said the aggregate death tolls reported by the Gaza Health Ministry have typically proved to be accurate.
In the last few weeks, recording the dead in Gaza has become increasingly difficult in the chaos of the fighting, as hospitals come under direct fire, much of the health system ceases to function and other government officials have begun updating the number of killed instead of the ministry. But even before those changes, the number of women and children reported dead already outpaced other conflicts.
Women and children account for nearly 70 percent of all deaths reported in Gaza even though most combatants are men — an “extraordinary statistic,” Rick Brennan, the regional emergency director for the World Health Organization’s Eastern Mediterranean office, said at an event this month.
Normally, one would expect the opposite, Mr. Brennan said. In past clashes between Israel and Hamas, for example, about 60 percent of the reported deaths in Gaza were men.
The Israeli military spokesman, Colonel Conricus, said the high percentage of women and children reported killed in Gaza is another reason to mistrust the figures, adding that Israeli forces have warned civilians of strikes in advance “where it is feasible.”
Beyond that, Israeli officials have pointed not just to U.S. actions in Iraq and Syria, but also to the conduct of America and its allies during World War II.
In an address on Oct. 30, for example, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited the accidental bombing of a children’s hospital by Britain’s Royal Air Force when it was targeting the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen in 1945. And during visits to Israel by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Israeli officials privately invoked the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which together killed more than 100,000 people.
Modern international laws of war were developed largely in response to the atrocities of World War II.
In 1949, the Geneva Conventions codified protections for civilians during wartime. International law does not prohibit civilian casualties, but it does say that militaries must not target civilians directly or indiscriminately bomb civilian areas, and that incidental harm and the killing of civilians must not exceed the direct military advantage to be gained.
Two 2,000-Pound Bombs
In the first two weeks of the war, roughly 90 percent of the munitions Israel dropped in Gaza were satellite-guided bombs weighing 1,000 to 2,000 pounds, according to a senior U.S. military official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
Those bombs are “really big,” said Mr. Garlasco, the adviser for the PAX organization. Israel, he said, also has thousands of smaller bombs from the United States that are designed to limit damage in dense urban areas, but weapons experts say they have seen little evidence that they are being used frequently.
In one documented case, Israel used at least two 2,000-pound bombs during an Oct. 31 airstrike on Jabaliya, a densely populated area just north of Gaza City, flattening buildings and creating impact craters 40 feet wide, according to an analysis of satellite images, photos and videos by The New York Times. Airwars independently confirmed that at least 126 civilians were killed, more than half of them children.
The Israeli military said it had been targeting a Hamas commander and fighters, but acknowledged that it knew civilians were present. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said the casualties were a “tragedy of war.”
The barrage on Gaza has been intense.
Every day, local journalists in Gaza report strikes that hit private homes, some of which kill a dozen or more people as families shelter together in tight quarters. On Oct. 19, Israel struck a Greek Orthodox church where hundreds of Gaza’s small Christian community were sheltering at dinnertime, killing 18 civilians, according to an investigation by Amnesty International.
Colonel Conricus, the Israeli military spokesman, said that Hamas and its deliberate strategy of embedding itself in — and underneath — the residents of Gaza are “the main reason why there are civilian casualties.”
He said that hundreds of Israeli strikes on Hamas have been diverted “because of the presence of civilians, children, women and others who appear not to be connected to the fighting.”
Still, Mr. Castner of Amnesty International said Israel appeared to be moving too quickly to reduce harm to civilians.
The United States itself has killed thousands of civilians in years of aerial bombardments. But it generally tries to assess civilians’ “pattern of life” before a strike, experts say. Analysts will watch to see whether people go out to get food or water, for example, to determine whether civilians are inside a building.
That kind of caution for every strike “is literally not possible for the Israelis to do if they’re doing this many strikes in as much time,” Mr. Castner said.
The Long Term
More children have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli assault began than in the world’s major conflict zones combined — across two dozen countries — during all of last year, even with the war in Ukraine, according to U.N. tallies of verified child deaths in armed conflict.
When civilian areas are in the cross hairs, the threat does not end when the bombing does, experts say. The destruction left in the wake of war leaves people facing a struggle to survive long after the conflict has ended. Decimated health-care systems and compromised water supplies alone can pose major public health risks, said Professor Crawford, the Costs of War Project researcher.
“In every war it’s like that,” she said. “But this is a scale of immiseration over such a short period of time that it’s really difficult to comprehend.”

Long before the temporary cease-fire ended in Gaza, the mood in Paterson, N.J., home to one of the largest communities of Palestinians outside the Middle East, was tense.
The mood has been dark lately in the Palestine Hair Salon. The TVs behind the barbers' chairs play a stream of war images that repeat across the mirrored walls: children in Gaza crying, men clawing at rubble, the wounded carried on planks through the streets of Rafah. 
  Raed Odeh is the owner and top barber of the shop, one of eight barbershops along Palestine Way in South Paterson, the center of one of the largest communities of Palestinians outside the Middle East. Mr. Odeh greets every customer, takes phone calls, cuts hair and watches the news, all while giving orders to his staff.
  Mr. Odeh also is a deputy mayor of Paterson.
  When he was asked his thoughts about the war in Gaza and its impact on Palestinians in New Jersey, a dozen men in the barbershop stopped talking and used the mirrors to gauge Mr. Odeh's reaction. He fell silent. He prefers not to discuss these matters in front of his customers.
  Eventually Mr. Odeh set down his razor, removed his smock and walked outside. In a small park with a wooden sign that reads, ''Welcome to Little Palestine: From Paterson to Jerusalem, 5,962 Miles,'' he felt freer to talk.
  ''This is a massacre,'' said Mr. Odeh, 51. ''I'm very worried. I wonder if Gaza is still going to exist next month.'' 
  After weeks of anxiety and rage, the brief cease-fire in Gaza brought a measure of relief, though even before it collapsed, the residents of Paterson were doubtful it would hold.
  In dozens of interviews over the last month, many Palestinians in this part of New Jersey expressed grief and fear for relatives in Gaza. They felt overwhelmed by television coverage and were glued to their phones, desperately checking social media and messaging apps for news from the war.
  Mohammed Abuassi, 29, a real estate investor, said he sends daily messages on WhatsApp to his cousins in Gaza. When one replies, he knows that cousin is alive. Nine of his family members were killed by a single Israeli airstrike early in the war, he said.
  Militants with Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, taking about 240 hostages and killing about 1,200 people, Israeli authorities said. Israel responded with ground and air attacks that, according to Gazan health authorities, have killed more than 15,000 people in Gaza.
  The conflict has also hardened long-held feelings among many Palestinians in New Jersey of alienation from American institutions, even as they witness and participate in the largest pro-Palestinian demonstrations in American history.
  ''The protests give me hope,'' said Diab Mustafa, chairman of the Palestinian American Community Center in Clifton, a suburb of Paterson. ''But the reactions to the protests, I don't like. You should be able to march for Palestinian rights without being called antisemitic or a terrorist sympathizer.''
  Since shortly after the war began, antisemitic incidents have risen all across the country. Many Palestinians in Paterson also reported a shocking rise in Islamophobic rhetoric. According to a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the group received nearly 1,300 reports of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab bias and violence in the United States in the month after Oct. 7 -- a 216 percent increase over the same period last year.
  ''We feel abandoned and betrayed,'' said Dina Sayedahmed, a spokeswoman for the council's New Jersey chapter. ''People are grouping Palestinians and Muslims as if suddenly we're all the enemy.''
  The incidents in the report include a man who invited people to help him ''hunt Palestinians''; the stabbing of a 6-year-old boy in Chicago; and death threats to Muslim parents outside a school in Fair Lawn, N.J., a few blocks from Paterson. More recently, three Palestinian students were shot last month in an unprovoked attack in Burlington, Vt.
  ''The shooting in Vermont has been terrifying,'' said Rania Mustafa, 31, executive director of the Palestinian American Community Center. ''But it was inevitable due to all the anti-Palestinian and anti-Islamic rhetoric in the media and by politicians.''
  In less fraught times, the televisions in Palestine Hair Salon play soccer games nonstop. But since the war began, the TVs have stayed tuned to Al Jazeera.
  ''I think you'll find that most people here don't trust Western media,'' Mr. Odeh said.
  Central to this distrust is the anger and humiliation at what Palestinians in New Jersey universally described as 75 years of Israeli occupation since the Nakba, or ''catastrophe'' in Arabic, when 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israel war. The world's attention has been trained on Gaza since Oct. 7: To Palestinians in South Paterson, that confirms the suspicion that their lives matter only when Israelis die.
  ''Look, what happened on Oct. 7 is horrible,'' said Salaheddin Mustafa, outreach coordinator for the Islamic Center of Passaic County in Paterson, the largest mosque for Palestinians in New Jersey. ''But to start the conversation on Oct. 7, as if that is when the violence started, is just very frustrating. Occupation is violent. By its nature, it's insidious. It doesn't allow for human rights. That is the start of the conversation.''
  Paterson was founded in 1792 by Alexander Hamilton as the first industrial city in North America. Though its factories faltered after World War II, Paterson has endured as a diverse city of 156,000, where 62 percent of the residents are Hispanic, and 40 percent of children live in poverty.
  The first Palestinians arrived in South Paterson in the late 1960s, renting apartments from Syrian and Lebanese families, said André Sayegh, Paterson's first Arab American mayor, who grew up in the neighborhood.
  Today about 20,000 Palestinians live in a neighborhood that blurs the border between Paterson and Clifton.
  ''It felt very much like we were living in this insular bubble,'' said Ms. Mustafa, who grew up in Paterson and now lives in Clifton.
  The small triangular park is at the geographic center of South Paterson, situated on a five-block stretch of Main Street that last year was renamed Palestine Way, after a resolution proposed by Alaa Abdelaziz, the city's first Palestinian American councilman.
  Mr. Odeh's barbershop is in the middle of Palestine Way, surrounded by bakeries, stores selling ornate furniture and jewelry, and Al-Basha, a Palestinian restaurant that attracts diners from across New Jersey.
  As the Palestinian commercial district grew, so did the community's political power. Mosques in Paterson hosted campaign events for both Democratic and Republican senators and governors. Palestinian leaders maintain that Bill Pascrell Jr., the Democratic congressman from Paterson, owes his seat in part to their organizing work during his bruising primary fight for re-election in 2012, said Salaheddin Mustafa.
  Yet since Oct. 7, when Mr. Pascrell joined New Jersey's senators and governor -- all Democrats -- to declare support for Israel and decline to call for an unconditional cease-fire, South Paterson has effectively banned the officials from their mosques and public spaces.
  Mr. Mustafa said that politicians' aides have texted for weeks, asking to meet and repair the relationship. He has refused.
  ''Once you call for a cease-fire, we'll talk,'' said Mr. Mustafa. ''With Pascrell, it's very personal. He is persona non grata. We're done.''
  In an interview, Mr. Pascrell acknowledged that many of his Palestinian constituents were angry with him. He pointed to his support for President Biden's decision to send $100 million in humanitarian aid to the West Bank, and for efforts to provide food, water, medical supplies and safe passage to civilians in Gaza.
  ''Like all Americans, I want a permanent end to these hostilities and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis both,'' Mr. Pascrell said.
  Feeling spurned by their political leaders, some Palestinians in New Jersey said they were more determined than ever to build their community by themselves. Ms. Mustafa, of the Palestinian American Community Center, has assumed a frantic schedule.
  Last Tuesday, she hosted a livestream on Instagram to raise money for Palestinian college students from New Jersey. On Wednesday she led a class for students about grass-roots organizing, drove to Teaneck High School to support a student walkout and, finally, hosted a fund-raiser for the community center. On Friday, she held a news conference with children to protest Mr. Pascrell, and gave a lecture at the Islamic Center of Passaic County.
  On Tuesday evening, relaxing on the couch of her large and formal home in Clifton, she anxiously scanned her phone. Before the war, she paid a woman in Gaza to tutor her children in Arabic over Zoom. Ms. Mustafa has texted the woman every day since the war began. The tutor hasn't responded since Oct. 29.
  ''Now I can't reach her,'' Ms. Mustafa said. ''Does that mean she can't charge her phone? Is she dead? I don't know.''
  At 7:15, Ms. Mustafa managed to put her phone down. Yousef, 2, and his 5-year-old sister, Dina, snuggled into the couch beside her. She read them a picture book titled ''Sitti's Key,'' in which a Palestinian woman gives her granddaughter the key to her former home in Haifa, now part of Israel, a token of their family history and how they came to live in the United States.
  When the book was finished, Ms. Mustafa's husband, Ibrahim Issa, a 32-year-old architect, escorted the children upstairs to bed. Ms. Mustafa returned to her phone, texting friends about a support group she's starting next week for Palestinians in New Jersey to process their grief about the war.
  ''Whatever happens next, there is still a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza right now,'' Ms. Mustafa said, glancing up from the screen. ''The cease-fire means we can take one deep breath. Just one. Then we all need to get back to work.''

There have been five wars in the last 15 years between Israel and Hamas. How do we end the current one and prevent a sixth from happening, sooner or later? How do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with the need to address the roots of the conflict? For 75 years, diplomats, well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians and government leaders around the world have struggled to bring peace to this region. In that time an Egyptian president and an Israeli prime minister were assassinated by extremists for their efforts to end the violence.
And on and on it goes. 
  For those of us who want not only to bring this war to an end, but to avoid a future one, we must first be cleareyed about facts. On Oct. 7, Hamas, a terrorist organization, unleashed a barbaric attack against Israel, killing about 1,200 innocent men, women and children and taking more than 200 hostage. On a per-capita basis, if Israel had the same population as the United States, that attack would have been the equivalent of nearly 40,000 deaths, more than 10 times the fatalities that we suffered on 9/11.
  Israel, in response, under the leadership of its right-wing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment for corruption and whose cabinet includes outright racists, unleashed what amounts to total war against the Palestinian people. In Gaza, over 1.6 million Palestinians were forced out of their homes. Food, water, medical supplies and fuel were cut off. The United Nations estimates that 45 percent of the housing units in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed. According to the Gaza health ministry, more than 12,000 Palestinians, about half of whom are children, have been killed and many more wounded. And the situation becomes more dire every day.
  This is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks igniting a wider regional conflagration. We all want it to end as soon as possible. To make progress, however, we must grapple with the complexity of this situation that too many people on both sides want to wave away.
  First, Hamas has made it clear, before and after Oct. 7, that its goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction of the state of Israel. Just last week a spokesman for Hamas told The New York Times: ''I hope that the state of war with Israel will become permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will stand with us.''
  Second, Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope for a peaceful settlement -- maintaining the blockade of Gaza, deepening the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and largely ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians.
  Needless to say, I do not have all of the answers to this never-ending tragedy. But for those of us who believe in peace and justice, it is imperative that we do our best to provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that maps out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today. Here are my thoughts as to the best way forward and how the United States can rally the world around a moral position that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for the oppressed Palestinian population.
  To start, we must demand an immediate end to Israel's indiscriminate bombing, which is causing an enormous number of civilian casualties and is in violation of international law. Israel is at war with Hamas, not innocent Palestinian men, women and children. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood to take out one Hamas target. We don't know if this campaign has been effective in degrading Hamas's military capabilities. But we do know that a reported 70 percent of the casualties are women and children, and that 104 U.N. aid workers and 53 journalists have been killed. That's not acceptable.
  There must also be a significant, extended humanitarian pause so that badly needed aid -- food, water, medicine and fuel -- can get into Gaza and save lives. If Wednesday morning's deal -- in which 50 Israeli hostages are to be freed in exchange for a four-day pause in fighting -- is honored, it is a promising first step that we can build upon, and hopefully work to extend the pause. Meanwhile, the United Nations must be given time to safely set up the distribution network needed to prevent thirst, starvation and disease, to build shelters and evacuate those who need critical care. This window will also allow for talks to free as many hostages as possible. This extended pause must not precede a resumption of indiscriminate bombing. Israel will continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics to minimize civilian harm.
  If long-suffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at self-determination and a decent standard of living, there must be no long-term Israeli re-occupation and blockade of Gaza. If Hamas is going to be removed from power, as it must be, and Palestinians given the opportunity for a better life, an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Hamas. For the sake of regional peace and a brighter future for the Palestinian people, Gaza must have a chance to be free of Hamas. There can be no long-term Israeli occupation.
  To achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs, new Palestinian leadership will be required as part of a wider political process. And for that transformation and peace process to take place, Israel must make certain political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership committed to peace to build support. They must guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds. People who have lived in poverty and despair for years cannot be made permanently homeless. Israel must also commit to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and freeze settlements there as a first step toward permanently ending the occupation. Those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian people, hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it needs to assume administrative control of Gaza, likely after an interim stabilization period under an international force.
  Finally, if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future, there must be a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a two-state solution in the wake of this war. The United States, the international community and Israel's neighbors must move aggressively toward that goal. This would include dramatically increased international support for the Palestinian people, including from wealthy Gulf States. It would also mean the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with Israel.
  Let's be clear: this is not going to happen on its own. Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party was explicitly formed on the premise that ''between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only be Israeli sovereignty,'' and the current coalition agreement reinforces that goal. This is not just ideology. The Israeli government has systematically pursued this goal. The last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank, where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. They have used state violence to back up this de facto annexation. Since Oct. 7, the United Nations reports that at least 208 Palestinians, including 53 children, have been killed by Israeli security forces and settlers. This cannot be allowed to continue.
  Mr. Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical issues. So should we. If asking nicely worked, we wouldn't be in this position. The only way these necessary changes will happen is if the United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel. And we all know what that leverage is.
  For many years, the United States has provided Israel substantial sums of money -- with close to no strings attached. Currently, we provide $3.8 billion a year. President Biden has asked for $14.3 billion more on top of that sum and asked Congress to waive normal, already-limited oversight rules. The blank check approach must end. The United States must make clear that while we are friends of Israel, there are conditions to that friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate international law and our own sense of decency. That includes an end to indiscriminate bombing; a significant pause to bombing so that massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region; the right of displaced Gazans to return to their homes; no long-term Israeli occupation of Gaza; an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a freeze on settlement expansion; and a commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of the war.
  Over the years, people of good will around the world, including Israelis, have tried to address this conflict in a way that brings justice for Palestinians and security for Israel. I, and some other members of Congress, have tried to do what we could. Obviously, we did not do enough. Now we must recommit to this effort. The stakes are just too high to give up.

Israel Seizes Gaza Hospital That Became Symbol of the War Itself

Highlight: A raid of a hospital that Israel asserts is a base for Hamas is shaping up as a watershed moment in a conflict that has put the Mideast on edge.
Body


Since Israel’s ground troops invaded Gaza 19 days ago, the fate of its war has become largely entwined with the fate of the territory’s largest hospital.
Israeli soldiers on Wednesday morning stormed that hospital, Al-Shifa, searching its corridors and rooms for evidence to support Israel’s assertion that the sprawling medical complex doubles as a secret military command center. Over the course of the day, they hunted for weapons and interrogated those they found inside, according to both Israeli officials and Palestinians at the hospital.
The early-morning raid was seen by both sides as a watershed moment in the conflict, capable of shaping the pace and extent of the war.
Israel says Al-Shifa, a sprawling complex in Gaza City, conceals an underground military base and has presented its capture as a key metric of Israeli success. The Israelis also say that Hamas’s use of the hospital highlights how the group defends itself with human shields.
Hamas and the hospital’s leadership have denied the Israeli assertions. Al-Shifa, they say, is nothing other than a medical center and sanctuary for thousands of people uprooted by Israel’s strikes on Gaza. For Palestinians, the Israeli military’s focus on a major hospital, when such facilities are typically off-limits during times of war, is proof of its disregard for Palestinian life.
What Israel finds — or doesn’t — in the hospital could affect international sentiment about the invasion and influence the negotiations taking place on freeing more than 200 hostages being held by Hamas.
Eighteen hours after the raid on the hospital began, the Israeli military released photos and video that it said backed its assertions. It distributed images of 13 guns that it said its soldiers had discovered in the hospital, as well as a statement saying that it had found a military command center in the hospital’s M.R.I. unit.
In a video taken at the hospital, a military spokesman, Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, displayed caches of guns, ammunition, protective vests and Hamas military uniforms, some of which, he said, had been hidden behind M.R.I. machines and others in nearby storage units.
The New York Times was unable to verify the provenance of the weapons and equipment in the images or assess the claim of the command center’s existence. Apart from a gunfight outside the hospital at the start of the raid, there were no reports of clashes with Hamas gunmen at the site.
In a statement, Hamas dismissed the Israeli account as “a fabricated story that no one would believe.”
Should the Israelis in the end be unable to come up with compelling evidence that the hospital was used to house troops, store weapons and command fighters, they may find that the time left to achieve their stated goal — removing Hamas from power — has been curtailed. Israel’s targeting of Al-Shifa has already drawn global concern; a failure to prove the raid’s necessity could make Israel’s international partners less supportive of further Israeli operations in Gaza.
A spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, John F. Kirby, rejecting Hamas claims that the United States had given the raid on Al-Shifa a “green light,” said Wednesday that Israel had not alerted the White House ahead of time.
The war began on Oct. 7, after Hamas led a terrorist attack on Israel, killing an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapping roughly 240 others, according to Israeli officials. In the 40 days since, Israel’s counterattack — by air, sea and land — has killed more than 11,000 people in Gaza, including more than 4,600 children, according to health officials in Gaza.
Israel is pushing to oust Hamas from power and re-establish control over a territory that it occupied in 1967; in 2005, it disbanded its settlements there. Since 2007, when Hamas took full control of the narrow coastal enclave, Israel, in unison with Egypt, has maintained a tight blockade on Gaza.
Initially, at least, the raid on Wednesday seemed to pass without major bloodshed.
Israeli soldiers briefly exchanged fire with gunmen outside the hospital before entering, a senior military official said.
The hospital director, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said in a broadcast interview with Al Jazeera that the soldiers had destroyed a wall of the hospital compound before entering, shattering several windows and wounding people inside with shrapnel.
“We can see the tanks before our eyes and we can see the soldiers walking inside the hospital,” he said.
As the day progressed, witnesses described an operation that appeared more like a violent police raid than a pitched battle between two military forces.
Soldiers interrogated some of the people inside, according to both Israeli and Palestinian officials. Medical workers and patients were locked down in wards, unable to move between departments, according to Dr. Abu Salmiya. Some feared trying to gain access to the hospital pharmacy, lest they be shot, Dr. Abu Salmiya said.
A Palestinian man inside a surgical building said that word had spread of interrogations and searches, including excavations, and that a tight cordon of Israeli armored vehicles had closed around the hospital.
“There are sounds of explosions, but I don’t know what they are blowing up exactly,” said the witness, Mahmoud, whose full name is being withheld for security purposes. “But the sounds are coming from inside the building. Naturally, everyone is scared.”
Dr. Abu Salmiya said that by Wednesday evening, the Israeli ground forces had reached the hospital’s X-ray facilities, a warehouse and its main pharmacy, as well as its internal medicine, dialysis and specialized surgery departments.
Otherwise, with communications disrupted in Gaza City, little information was available on Wednesday. Earlier in the war, Israel blacked out communications by switching off Gaza’s phone networks, according to U.S. officials, but the latest outages might be tied to dwindling fuel supplies and Israeli strikes.
Early on Wednesday, the Israeli army said it had launched “a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa Hospital.” It said that its goal was not to harm civilians, and that it had sent incubators, Arabic speakers and medical supplies and personnel to join the operation.
The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza said in a statement that the Israeli soldiers had beaten patients, displaced people taking shelter at the hospital and had expelled others from the complex.
Because of the communications disruption, The New York Times could not reach hospital administrators. The Palestinian man interviewed by telephone in the surgery building at the hospital said he had not heard of anyone being beaten.
Palestinian officials, the heads of United Nations agencies and some Mideast regional leaders condemned the raid, warning that it put the lives of Gaza’s most vulnerable a risk.
Mr. Kirby, the National Security Council spokesman, said on Tuesday that the United States had its own intelligence supporting Israel’s assertion of a militant presence at Al-Shifa. But Mr. Kirby also said that the United States, Israel’s closest ally, did not want to see “a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire.”
Before the raid, the World Health Organization said that Al-Shifa had ceased to be a functional hospital, and officials described grim conditions there. They said that medicine and anesthetics had all but run out, as had fuel, forcing the shutdown of generators and lifesaving equipment. Some three dozen premature babies were at particular risk, they said.
“The smell of death wafts everywhere,” said Dr. Abu Salmiya.
At home, Israel’s leaders have been hoping to portray the military’s control of the hospital as a symbolic victory to the Israeli public, according to an official who spoke anonymously to discuss a sensitive matter.
The raid came as the government was deliberating whether to agree to a pause in fighting, a concession opposed by some Israelis. Foreign mediators are also negotiating a deal to exchange Palestinian prisoners in Israel for some of the hostages abducted on Oct. 7, according to officials and diplomats briefed on the negotiations.

The journalists were covering the aftermath of airstrikes at a U.N. school-turned-shelter in Khan Younis. The bureau chief’s wife, son, daughter and grandson had been killed in October.
An Al Jazeera cameraman was killed and the network’s Arabic-language Gaza Strip bureau chief was wounded on Friday during an attack in southern Gaza, Al Jazeera said, the latest in a long string of journalist casualties in the war.
The cameraman, Samer Abu Daqqa, and Wael al-Dahdouh, the bureau chief, were covering the aftermath of airstrikes at a U.N. school-turned-shelter in Khan Younis when both were wounded, the network said. Mr. al-Dahdouh told Al Jazeera that he was able to walk out of the area and seek help. Mr. Abu Daqqa bled to death from his injuries, as emergency medical help was unable to reach him, the network said.
Mr. Abu Daqqa, 45, was the 13th Al Jazeera journalist killed since the network opened in 1996, according to Al Jazeera.
His funeral was held in Khan Younis on Saturday. Al Jazeera televised part of his funeral, where Mr. al-Dahdouh spoke alongside dozens of other colleagues, family members. Fellow journalists, including Mr. al-Dahdouh, wept in anguish, some caressing the cameraman’s bloodied face. His press flak jacket and blue helmet rested atop his shrouded body. Mr. al-Dahdouh accused Israeli forces of targeting dozens of journalists, their offices and their families. “We will continue to do our duty with the best professionalism and transparency,” despite the targeting of journalists, he said. “We will carry our message.”
The Israeli military said that it “has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists,” and it takes “operationally feasible measures” to protect civilians and journalists. Khan Younis is one of three areas that Israel has said it is targeting in its battle to eradicate Hamas from Gaza.
In October, Mr. al-Dahdouh’s wife, son, daughter and infant grandson were killed at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, where they had been sheltering.
Mohamed Moawad, Al Jazeera’s managing editor, described Mr. Abu Daqqa as “a compassionate soul” whose photography “captured the raw and unfiltered reality and life in Gaza.”
“In the pursuit of truth, our cameraman faced immense risks to bring viewers a deeper understanding of the human experience in Gaza,” he said in a post on social media. “His lens became a window into the lives of those affected by conflict, shedding light on stories that needed to be told.”
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit organization based in New York that defends the rights of journalists around the world, 64 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, more than in any other similar period of time since the group started collecting data in 1992.
The C.P.J. defines journalists as “people who cover news or comment on public affairs through print, digital, broadcast media and other means,” and media workers as essential support staff, including translators, drivers and fixers. The group has said it does not include people in its tallies if there is evidence of their “acting on behalf of militant groups or serving in a military capacity at the time of their deaths.”
According to the C.P.J.’s data, some of the 64 killed in Gaza were freelancers and did not work for traditional news outlets, and its website noted that it was unclear whether all of them were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths. Israel and Egypt have largely prevented international journalists from entering the enclave since the conflict began; Hamas, which controls Gaza, has long restricted what the news media there can cover.
Carlos Martínez de la Serna, C.P.J.’s program director, said the organization was concerned about “the pattern of attacks on Al Jazeera journalists and their families.”
In a statement, Al Jazeera blamed Israel for Friday’s attack in Khan Younis and for “systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families.” It urged “the international community, media freedom organizations, and the International Criminal Court to take immediate action to hold the Israeli government and military accountable.”
John Kirby, a White House spokesman, said he was not aware of any evidence that Israel was intentionally targeting journalists, who he said must be protected.
“It’s never acceptable to deliberately target them, as they do such vital, dangerous, dangerous work,” he said, adding, “That’s a principle that we’re going to continue to abide by.”
International watchdogs have said that an Israeli strike on Oct. 13 that killed a videographer for the Reuters news agency and injured six other journalists was a targeted attack carried out by the Israeli military. Earlier this year, a C.P.J. report found that no one had been held accountable for nearly 20 journalists killed by the Israeli military since 2001.

Some people in the West Bank, where frustration with the Palestinian Authority has been simmering for years, believe Hamas and other armed groups are the only ones they can trust to protect them.
Follow live news updates on the Israel-Hamas war. 
  The two cousins spotted each other on the bus leaving the prison, as shocked to see the other as they were by their sudden freedom. ''Pinch me,'' Anwar Atta, 18, told his younger cousin. ''I need to know if this is a dream.''
  Then, early Sunday morning, the bus pulled out of Ofer Prison in the West Bank and into a throng of cheering Palestinians. Before the cousins' feet could touch the ground, they were hoisted into the air and carried through the streets of Ramallah, surrounded by people waving Palestinian and Hamas flags, revving their motorcycle engines and whistling in excitement.
  ''This is thanks to the resistance in Gaza,'' Anwar said hours later from his family's home on the outskirts of the city.
  Anwar and his cousin, Mourad Atta, 17, are among the 180 Palestinian teenagers and women freed from Israeli prisons in recent days, the largest such release of prisoners and detainees in more than a decade. Their freedom is part of a deal in which the Palestinians were traded for 81 hostages, many of them children, captured during the Hamas-led terrorist attack in Israel on Oct. 7. The deal also included a temporary cease-fire in the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 13,000 people, according to Gazan officials.
  Israel's bombardment of Gaza and the elation over the prisoners' release have deepened support for Hamas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority has administered cities and towns for more than two decades. Gaza, the other Palestinian enclave, has by contrast been controlled since 2007 by Hamas, a militant group.
  Now, as many in the West Bank fear the war could spread to the occupied territory, some believe Hamas and other armed groups are the only ones they can trust to protect them.
  The Palestinian Authority -- which is controlled by the Fatah political faction -- is deeply unpopular and widely seen as a subcontractor to the Israeli occupation. Long-simmering frustrations with the authority's leadership and accusations of corruption have been exacerbated in the past year by an uptick in violence by Israeli settlers.
  For some Palestinians living under military occupation in the West Bank, the freed prisoners have become a potent symbol of Hamas's ability to achieve tangible results and its willingness to fight for the Palestinian cause. Each night in Ramallah, as new batches of prisoners were released, one refrain echoed across the crowds: ''The people want Hamas! The people want Hamas!''
  Pollsters and analysts caution that support for the group is limited to a minority of residents and tends to rise temporarily during conflicts in Gaza. But with fears that a wider war could break out in the West Bank, many say the growing support for Hamas, which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Israel and other countries, has taken on a new dimension.
  There is a growing sense that people need protection and they ''don't have any alternative,'' said Ghassan Khatib, director of the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center, which specializes in research and opinion polling. ''The only game in town is Hamas.''
  Hours after his release, Anwar Atta and his cousin Mourad sat outside their families' homes in Deir Abu Masha'al, a village of around 4,000 people on the outskirts of Ramallah. A steady stream of neighbors and relatives came to welcome them home, smoking cigarettes and drinking small cups of coffee.
  ''Where have you been, it's been a while,'' Anwar's aunt, Halima Atta, chided him as she held him in her arms. ''Are you going to keep making trouble?''
  ''I'm done, OK? I'm done,'' he replied.
  ''No, you have a beard now -- you're a man,'' Halima joked.
  The reunion was years in the making. Anwar was arrested in June 2021, which he says was for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers -- an act of resistance spurred by an Israeli military offensive in Gaza a month earlier. The Israeli authorities say he threw an ''incendiary device.''
  Over the more than two years he spent awaiting trial, Anwar had come to accept that most of his early adulthood would be spent behind bars -- a price he was willing to pay to defend his land, he said.
  After the Oct. 7 attack, which Israeli officials say killed an estimated 1,200 people, news of Hamas taking hostages spread between the cells at Ofer Prison -- sparking hope that a prisoner release could follow. Inmates clapped and cheered, crying ''God is great'' and praising the armed resistance, Anwar recalled.
  The weeks that followed, he said, were the harshest of his time in prison. Anwar, other recently released prisoners and human rights groups say that prison officials rationed water and electricity. They confiscated TVs and radios, and barred relatives from visiting -- effectively creating an information blackout. And as prison officials stepped up their searches for contraband, they forced inmates to kneel on the floor and beat them, released prisoners and rights groups said.
  The Israeli prison service has said that it has imposed tighter restrictions in prisons in recent weeks -- including confiscating electronics, canceling family visits and carrying out hundreds of searches -- in connection with the war effort. Officials say that prisoners are able to file complaints that would be examined by the authorities.
  Hundreds of new inmates also flooded into the prison -- some of the more than 2,000 Palestinians arrested since Oct. 7 -- and shared news of the war in hushed whispers, Anwar said. The inmates devoured each morsel of new information, both stunned at the sheer devastation in Gaza and wondering if the war could also bring their freedom.
  Then last week, the moment Anwar had been praying for arrived.
  Early Sunday morning, Mourad's mother was sitting on the sagging couch in their living room, watching the news on TV and agonizing over whether her son would be among those released. When she saw Mourad and Anwar's faces flash across the screen waving from the bus of prisoners, she leaped from her seat.
  ''We were screaming and jumping and crying -- we couldn't believe it,'' his mother, Amal Atta, 35, said.
  Mourad was arrested after throwing stones at Israeli soldiers in August 2022, prompted by a days-long military offensive in Gaza by Israel earlier that month, he said. Israeli authorities accused him of throwing an explosive device. Like his cousin, he, too, was never tried.
  The teenagers' return to the village has been celebrated for days; young children have run around their houses devouring sweets while older relatives have pulled Anwar and Mourad in for hugs.
  ''Why do you think he was in prison? It's because of everything he's seen here, everything he's exposed to -- it made him want to go out and fight back,'' Anwar's uncle, Omar Atta, 45, said, sitting among their relatives Sunday evening.
  As his relatives hugged nearby, Omar looked out over the hillside, a crisp breeze rattling the branches of the olive trees below. Since the war began, Israeli soldiers have erected a new barricade blocking the only paved road leading to their village. Israeli security forces have raided homes in the village and arrested around a dozen of his neighbors, he said. Frustration and anger have swelled.
  ''Israel thinks they are suppressing or destroying the resistance,'' Omar explained. ''But look at what they are doing. They are only making it stronger.''

Top Israeli officials hinted at a powerful response to attacks by Hezbollah across the northern border with Lebanon, as to the south Israeli troops wage street battles against Hamas in Gaza.
Street-to-street combat raged in what Israel described as three Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip on Monday, as top Israeli officials warned that increased attacks on northern Israel by Hezbollah, from Lebanon, could prompt a powerful response.
Fighting in “fierce and difficult battles,” the Israeli military said Monday that the number of its soldiers killed in the ground invasion of Gaza had surpassed 100 — a fraction of the death toll among Palestinian civilians and Hamas fighters, but a measure of the intensity of the urban warfare.
At the same time, in a sign that the smoldering tensions inflamed across the Middle East by the war in Gaza could be heating up, Israeli leaders hinted at escalating a conflict on another front, with Hezbollah, which like Hamas is backed by Iran.
Increasing Hezbollah strikes on northern Israel “demand of Israel to remove such a threat,” Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet and former defense minister, told the American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, in a phone call, according to a statement by Mr. Gantz’s office.
The chief of staff of Israel’s military, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said on a visit to the northern border with Lebanon on Sunday that Hezbollah risked pushing his forces to make a “very clear change” in the confrontation. Neither he nor Mr. Gantz elaborated on what additional steps Israel might take, but General Halevi said that on both frontiers, Israel needs a return of “both safety and a sense of security.”
A third Iranian-backed militia, the Houthis, threatened over the weekend to step up attacks on ships bound for Israel that are transiting the Red Sea. The French Navy said on Sunday that one of its frigates there had shot down two drones launched from Yemen, where the Houthis are based.
In Gaza, the Israeli military said it had taken control of the area surrounding the former headquarters of Hamas in Gaza City, and released images showing soldiers firing barrages of gunfire as they moved tensely through nearly deserted, rubble-filled streets.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, spokesman for the Israeli military, told reporters that it was focused on fighting in three areas that are Hamas strongholds: Jabaliya and Shajaiye, two neighborhoods in northern Gaza, and in Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza.
Jabaliya, a densely populated area just north of Gaza City, has been struck relentlessly by Israeli forces since the first weeks of the war, including with at least two 2,000-pound bombs during one airstrike last month, according to a New York Times analysis. Israeli troops have also targeted Shajaiye, a residential area, since the start of their ground invasion.
The intense fighting came as the United Nations and aid agencies warned of what António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, said was chaos and the risk of epidemics in the shrinking pockets of the territory where civilians have sought refuge from Israeli bombardments.
More than 15,000 Palestinians — possibly far more — have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its retaliatory campaign against Hamas, in response to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led raids that killed some 1,200 people in Israel. Israeli officials say their forces have killed thousands of Hamas fighters; the Gazan authorities say most of the dead have been women and children.
A number of European countries that have been vociferous in calling for a cease-fire sought to strike a balance Monday between supporting Israel’s effort to defeat Hamas and maintaining pressure on Israel to curb civilian suffering.
The European Union’s foreign ministers met Monday in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Hamas after France, Italy and Germany sent a joint letter to Josep Borrell Fontelles, the E.U.’s top diplomat, urging the bloc to “take all necessary measures” against the group.
“This implies a stronger European commitment both to combating Hamas’s infrastructure and financial support, and to isolating and delegitimizing Hamas internationally,” the ministers wrote in the letter, adding that Hamas “in no way represents the Palestinians or their legitimate aspirations.”
The United Nations estimates that 1.9 million of Gaza’s roughly 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes, most of them crowding into parts of the south where they lack basic necessities like food, clean water and sanitation.
Aid groups have accused Israel of seeking to push the Gazans into Egypt, which Israel denies. The Egyptian government has said it will not accept Palestinian refugees.
As Israel’s war with Hamas enters its third month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is resisting mounting international pressure to wind down its military campaign.
Mr. Netanyahu said on Sunday that he had spoken recently with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, President Emmanuel Macron of France and other leaders, urging them to continue backing the Israeli war until Hamas was ousted from Gaza. “I told them you can’t support the elimination of Hamas on the one hand, and pressure us to end the war, which would prevent Hamas’s elimination,” Mr. Netanyahu told members of his cabinet in a video statement.
At home, Mr. Netanyahu’s government has faced pressure to seek at least another pause in the fighting from families of the roughly 137 hostages who were seized in the Hamas attack on Israel and remain in Gaza, although it is unclear what Hamas would demand for their release. More than 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong cease-fire that began Nov. 24, in return for the release of Palestinians being held in Israeli jails.
At least 20 hostages are believed to have been killed after they were abducted, according to an Israeli government spokesman, Eylon Levy, heightening concerns for the fate of the rest. Hamas has claimed that many died in Israeli airstrikes.
The Biden administration has, for now, publicly backed the Israeli government, despite criticism, and says it has not set a deadline for Israel to end the war. On Friday, the United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire.
The Israeli military, which has been criticized by Mr. Macron, among others, for not clearly laying out an exit strategy, says its forces are engaged in intense battles with Hamas in areas where it said the group still had “strongholds.” The Israeli military now controls the area in Gaza City surrounding Palestine Square, home to municipal offices and the headquarters for Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s leader in the enclave, Admiral Hagari said at a news conference late Sunday.
As of Monday, 104 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the ground invasion began in late October. 
Israel has yet to find Mr. Sinwar, who they believe is hiding in southern Gaza. Officials said last week that Israeli forces had surrounded his house in the Khan Younis region, although his location was unknown. Military officials have described him as a “mastermind” of the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, and Admiral Hagari said that capturing or killing him was still a goal of the war.
The director of Israel’s national security council, Tzahi Hanegbi, has rejected the idea that the lives of Mr. Sinwar and other top Hamas leaders could be spared if they went into exile outside Gaza, as Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, did in 1982 during an Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
“I believe that Sinwar isn’t a partner for a model of that kind,” Mr. Hanegbi told Israel’s Channel 12 in an interview that aired this past weekend. “But if we kill him, which is the intention, the leadership that succeeds him might understand that in order to be spared his fate it needs to leave the Gaza Strip humiliated, but at least to save its life.”

  5 things to know about the
  Israel-Hamas war

  for the past seven weeks, you've probably been overhearing some scary news. There's a war going on in the Middle East between Israel and an armed group called Hamas. More than 1.6 million people have had to leave their homes, according to the United Nations, and thousands have died in attacks. Here in the United States (and all over the world), people are very concerned, both about the violence there and hateful attacks closer to home. The conflict is complicated and tense. These are five things to know about what's going on.
  Palestinians fleeing after an Israeli attack in Gaza City on Oct. 23. The war has led to protests worldwide as people and governments disagree about what to do.
  What happened?
  1 Hamas committed a devastating attack on Oct. 7.
  Hamas attacked Israel early in the morning on Oct. 7 and killed an estimated 1,200 people. Most of the people who died were civilians, which is a word that means ordinary people who are not part of an army or other group fighting a war. Killing civilians on purpose is one of the worst things that fighters can do. It's a crime everywhere in the world.
  During the attacks, Hamas and other groups also took about 240 hostages, including kids and elderly people, and brought them to the Gaza Strip. So far, Hamas has only released a few of them. The rest are still being held captive. The hostages' families, and people around the world, are desperate for them to return home.
  Israel
  DEFINITION: A country in the Middle East. It was established in 1948 as a place for Jewish people to live and govern themselves. It is home to cities and historical sites that are important to the religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Before 1948, the region where Israel is was known as Palestine. Throughout history, it fell under the rule of many different governments and countries, and people of many different faiths lived there. 
  Palestinians 
  DEFINITION: The Arab people who lived on the land before Israel became a country (and their descendants). During Israel's War of Independence in 1948, many Palestinians left their land or were violently forced off it. Israel did not let them come back.
  2 In response, Israel attacked the Gaza Strip.
  After Hamas's attack, Israel's military began heavily bombing cities and towns in Gaza to try to destroy Hamas. Many buildings have been completely flattened. That has also killed a lot of civilians. According to the Gaza Health Ministry in mid-November, more than 11,000 people had been killed, most of them women and children. The real number may be even higher. 
  Gaza Strip 
  DEFINITION: A small area of land between Israel and Egypt where many Palestinians ended up after they had to leave their homes. Gaza is not a country, but many people hope that it will be eventually, along with another territory called the West Bank. It is about the size of Philadelphia, and more than two million people live there. Israel and Egypt control the borders of the Gaza Strip and keep tight limits on who and what gets in and out.
  Hamas 
  DEFINITION: A group that governs inside the Gaza Strip. Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, and it has committed many violent attacks against Israel in the past. (Oct. 7 was the largest.) For many years, Hamas called for Israel to be destroyed, but in 2017 it said it would accept a smaller, independent Palestinian country alongside it. The U.S. government considers it a terrorist group.
  how did we get here?
  3 The attack is recent, but the conflict has a long history.
  The violence happening today goes back to an old fight about who has a right to govern the land Israelis and Palestinians live on. In 1948, the United Nations came up with a plan for the land to be divided into two countries: one for Jewish people and the other for Palestinians. Nearby Arab countries weren't happy with the plan and went to war with Israel. When Israel won, it got most of the land. Palestinians never got their own country, and hundreds of thousands of them resettled in Gaza and the West Bank.
  For many years, leaders around the world, including in the United States, have been trying to reach a peace agreement that would create a Palestinian country and end the fighting. But it has not worked. And in the meantime, extreme groups on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides have used violence to push for their goals, which has made it even harder to come to an agreement.
  what happens now?
  4 Palestinian civilians are trapped in Gaza.
  Since Oct. 7, Israel has blocked most food, water, medicine and fuel from entering Gaza. Many experts have said that this is a crime. The United Nations and aid groups have been able to send in some food and supplies, but they say that it's not nearly enough for all the people in Gaza. Some people are drinking dirty water, which makes them very sick. Food supplies are running low. Some hospitals have had to close down, even though people are wounded and sick. And because Gaza's borders are closed, people cannot escape.
  5 There have been huge protests around the world.
  People are worried about what is going to happen. Over the last few weeks, there have been protests against the war in the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Hundreds of thousands of people have marched to demand a stop to the fighting. There have also been protests in support of Israel and calling for Hamas and the other groups to release their hostages. 
  The war has also led to a rise in attacks and hate against Jewish and Muslim people all over the world. That prejudice has made a lot of people very scared, even if they don't live in Israel or Gaza. No one knows when or how the war will end. â—Š

Big Bombs in Urban Areas Raise Civilian Toll in Gaza,"

Big Bombs in Urban Areas Raise Civilian Toll in Gaza

In less than two months, more than twice as many women and children have been reported killed in Gaza than in Ukraine after two years of war.
Israel has cast the deaths of civilians in the Gaza Strip as a regrettable but unavoidable part of modern conflict, pointing to the heavy human toll from military campaigns the United States itself once waged in Iraq and Syria. 
  But a review of past conflicts and interviews with casualty and weapons experts suggest that Israel's assault is different.
  While wartime death tolls will never be exact, experts say that even a conservative reading of the casualty figures reported from Gaza shows that the pace of death during Israel's campaign has few precedents in this century.
  People are being killed in Gaza more quickly, they say, than in even the deadliest moments of U.S.-led attacks in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, which were themselves widely criticized by human rights groups.
  Precise comparisons of war dead are impossible, but conflict-casualty experts have been taken aback at just how many people have been reported killed in Gaza -- most of them women and children -- and how rapidly.
  It is not just the scale of the strikes -- Israel said it had engaged more than 15,000 targets before reaching a brief cease-fire in recent days. It is also the nature of the weaponry itself.
  Israel's liberal use of very large weapons in dense urban areas, including U.S.-made 2,000-pound bombs that can flatten an apartment tower, is surprising, some experts say.
  ''It's beyond anything that I've seen in my career,'' said Marc Garlasco, a military adviser for the Dutch organization PAX and a former senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon. To find a historical comparison for so many large bombs in such a small area, he said, we may ''have to go back to Vietnam, or the Second World War.''
  In fighting during this century, by contrast, U.S. military officials often believed that the most common American aerial bomb -- a 500-pound weapon -- was far too large for most targets when battling the Islamic State in urban areas like Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria.
  The Israeli military points out that Gaza presents a battlefield like few others. It is small and dense, with civilians living next to, and even on top of, Hamas combatants who rely on tunnel networks to shield themselves and their weapons, putting residents directly in the line of fire, the military says.
  Given these underground networks -- which the military says enabled Hamas to wage its deadly attacks on Oct. 7 -- Israeli forces say they use the ''smallest available ordnance'' to achieve their strategic objectives in order to cause the ''minimal adverse effect on civilians.''
  Civilian casualties are notoriously hard to calculate, and officials in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip do not separate the deaths of civilians and combatants.
  Researchers point instead to the roughly 10,000 women and children reported killed in Gaza as an approximate -- though conservative -- measure of civilian deaths in the territory. International officials and experts familiar with the way figures are compiled by health officials in Gaza say the overall numbers are generally reliable.
  The Israeli military acknowledged that children, women and older people have been killed in Gaza, but said the death toll reported in Gaza could not be trusted because the territory is run by Hamas. The military did not provide a count of its own, but said that civilians ''are not the target'' of its campaign.
  ''We do a lot in order to prevent and, where possible, minimize the killing or wounding of civilians,'' said Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman. ''We focus on Hamas.''
  Still, researchers say the pace of deaths reported in Gaza during the Israeli bombardment has been exceptionally high.
  More than twice as many women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza than in Ukraine after almost two years of Russian attacks, according to United Nations estimates.
  More women and children have been reported killed in Gaza in less than two months than the roughly 7,700 civilians documented as killed by U.S. forces and their international allies in the entire first year of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to estimates from Iraq Body Count, an independent British research group.
  And the number of women and children reported killed in Gaza since the Israeli campaign began last month has already started to approach the roughly 12,400 civilians documented to have been killed by the United States and its allies in Afghanistan during nearly 20 years of war, according to Neta C. Crawford, co-director of Brown University's Costs of War Project.
  These comparisons are based on the thousands of deaths directly attributed to U.S. coalition forces over decades in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Far more people -- hundreds of thousands in total -- are estimated to have been killed in these conflicts by other groups, including the Syrian government and its allies, local militias, the Islamic State and the Iraqi security forces.
  But while the overall death tolls in those wars were larger, the number of people killed in Gaza ''in a very short period of time is higher than in other conflicts,'' said Professor Crawford, who has extensively researched modern wars.
  In the nine-month battle of Mosul, which Israeli officials have cited as a comparison, an estimated total of 9,000 to 11,000 civilians were killed by all sides in the conflict, including many thousands killed by the Islamic State, The Associated Press found.
  A similar number of women and children have already been reported killed in Gaza in less than two months.
  The bombs being used in Gaza are larger than what the United States used when it was fighting ISIS in cities like Mosul and Raqqa, and are more consistent with targeting underground infrastructure like tunnels, said Brian Castner, a weapons investigator for Amnesty International and a former explosive ordnance disposal officer in the U.S. Air Force.
  Not only is Gaza tiny when compared with conflict zones like Iraq, Afghanistan or Ukraine, but the territory's borders have also been closed by Israel and Egypt, giving civilians few, if any, safe places to flee.
  More than 60,000 buildings have been damaged or destroyed in the Gaza Strip, satellite analysis indicates, including about half of the buildings in northern Gaza.
  ''They are using extremely large weapons in extremely densely populated areas,'' Mr. Castner said of Israeli forces. ''It is the worst possible combination of factors.''
  A War 'for Our Existence'
  Israeli officials say their campaign is focused on degrading Gazan military infrastructure that is often built near homes and civilian institutions -- or buried underneath them.
  ''To get to that target,'' Colonel Conricus said, the military has to use ''larger bombs with a higher yield.''
  When an Israeli government spokesman, Mark Regev, was asked in an Oct. 24 interview with PBS about the pace of the strikes, he said Israel was aiming for a shorter campaign than the United States waged in Iraq and Syria.
  ''Hopefully, we get it done quicker,'' Mr. Regev said. ''That's one of our goals. But it could take longer than many Israelis would hope, because Hamas has been in power for 16 years.''
  Israel has directed Gaza residents to evacuate areas where the bombing campaign is especially concentrated, but it has continued to strike other areas as well.
  More broadly, Israeli officials say this is a campaign on its own borders to wipe out Hamas, a group dedicated to Israel's destruction. ''The war here is for our existence,'' one Israeli war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, told reporters on Nov. 8.
  The brutality of the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 traumatized Israelis, and some prominent members of the Israeli government have made clear that they are waging a ferocious campaign.
  ''Gaza won't return to what it was before. Hamas will no longer exist. We will eliminate everything,'' Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, said in the days after the Hamas raids.
  After initially questioning the death toll in Gaza, the Biden administration now concedes that the true figures for civilian casualties may be even worse.
  Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, told a House committee this month that American officials thought the civilian casualties were ''very high, frankly, and it could be that they're even higher than are being cited.''
  International experts who have worked with the Gaza Health Ministry during this and other wars say that it gathers death figures from hospitals and morgues across the enclave, which tally the dead and report the names, ID numbers and other details of people killed.
  While the experts urged caution around public statements about the specific number of people killed in a particular strike -- especially in the immediate aftermath of a blast -- they said the aggregate death tolls reported by the Gaza Health Ministry have typically proved to be accurate.
  In the last few weeks, recording the dead in Gaza has become increasingly difficult in the chaos of the fighting, as hospitals come under direct fire, much of the health system ceases to function and other government officials have begun updating the number of killed instead of the ministry. But even before those changes, the number of women and children reported dead already outpaced other conflicts.
  Women and children account for nearly 70 percent of all deaths reported in Gaza even though most combatants are men -- an ''extraordinary statistic,'' Rick Brennan, the regional emergency director for the World Health Organization's Eastern Mediterranean office, said at an event this month.
  Normally, one would expect the opposite, Mr. Brennan said. In past clashes between Israel and Hamas, for example, about 60 percent of the reported deaths in Gaza were men.
  The Israeli military spokesman, Colonel Conricus, said the high percentage of women and children reported killed in Gaza is another reason to mistrust the figures, adding that Israeli forces have warned civilians of strikes in advance ''where it is feasible.''
  Beyond that, Israeli officials have pointed not just to U.S. actions in Iraq and Syria, but also to the conduct of America and its allies during World War II.
  In an address on Oct. 30, for example, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited the accidental bombing of a children's hospital by Britain's Royal Air Force when it was targeting the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen in 1945. And during visits to Israel by Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Israeli officials privately invoked the 1945 U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which together killed more than 100,000 people.
  Modern international laws of war were developed largely in response to the atrocities of World War II.
  In 1949, the Geneva Conventions codified protections for civilians during wartime. International law does not prohibit civilian casualties, but it does say that militaries must not target civilians directly or indiscriminately bomb civilian areas, and that incidental harm and the killing of civilians must not exceed the direct military advantage to be gained.
  Two 2,000-Pound Bombs
  In the first two weeks of the war, roughly 90 percent of the munitions Israel dropped in Gaza were satellite-guided bombs weighing 1,000 to 2,000 pounds, according to a senior U.S. military official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
  Those bombs are ''really big,'' said Mr. Garlasco, the adviser for the PAX organization. Israel, he said, also has thousands of smaller bombs from the United States that are designed to limit damage in dense urban areas, but weapons experts say they have seen little evidence that they are being used frequently.
  In one documented case, Israel used at least two 2,000-pound bombs during an Oct. 31 airstrike on Jabaliya, a densely populated area just north of Gaza City, flattening buildings and creating impact craters 40 feet wide, according to an analysis of satellite images, photos and videos by The New York Times. Airwars independently confirmed that at least 126 civilians were killed, more than half of them children.
  The Israeli military said it had been targeting a Hamas commander and fighters, but acknowledged that it knew civilians were present. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said the casualties were a ''tragedy of war.''
  The barrage on Gaza has been intense.
  Every day, local journalists in Gaza report strikes that hit private homes, some of which kill a dozen or more people as families shelter together in tight quarters. On Oct. 19, Israel struck a Greek Orthodox church where hundreds of Gaza's small Christian community were sheltering at dinnertime, killing 18 civilians, according to an investigation by Amnesty International.
  Colonel Conricus, the Israeli military spokesman, said that Hamas and its deliberate strategy of embedding itself in -- and underneath -- the residents of Gaza are ''the main reason why there are civilian casualties.''
  He said that hundreds of Israeli strikes on Hamas have been diverted ''because of the presence of civilians, children, women and others who appear not to be connected to the fighting.''
  Still, Mr. Castner of Amnesty International said Israel appeared to be moving too quickly to reduce harm to civilians.
  The United States itself has killed thousands of civilians in years of aerial bombardments. But it generally tries to assess civilians' ''pattern of life'' before a strike, experts say. Analysts will watch to see whether people go out to get food or water, for example, to determine whether civilians are inside a building.
  That kind of caution for every strike ''is literally not possible for the Israelis to do if they're doing this many strikes in as much time,'' Mr. Castner said.
  The Long Term
  More children have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli assault began than in the world's major conflict zones combined -- across two dozen countries -- during all of last year, even with the war in Ukraine, according to U.N. tallies of verified child deaths in armed conflict.
  When civilian areas are in the cross hairs, the threat does not end when the bombing does, experts say. The destruction left in the wake of war leaves people facing a struggle to survive long after the conflict has ended. Decimated health-care systems and compromised water supplies alone can pose major public health risks, said Professor Crawford, the Costs of War Project researcher.
  ''In every war it's like that,'' she said. ''But this is a scale of immiseration over such a short period of time that it's really difficult to comprehend.''

The Iranian-backed militia in Yemen has launched drone and missile attacks on Israeli and American targets. American officials fear the group could go too far and incite a wider war.
The Houthis, Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen who have launched recent drone and missile attacks on Israeli and American targets, are emerging as an unpredictable and dangerous wild card in the Middle East -- the proxies that Iran considers most suited to widening the war with Israel. 
  Analysts close to the Iranian government said the Houthis' base in Yemen makes them ideally positioned to escalate fighting in the region, in the hopes of pressuring Israel to end its war with Hamas in Gaza.
  The analysts' assessment tracks with descriptions of a plan by Iran and its network of militias to increase attacks on Israeli and American targets in the region, according to two Iranians affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who were not authorized to speak publicly.
  The Houthis, the analysts said, are Iran's chosen proxies because from Yemen they are both close enough to the Red Sea's strategic waterways to disrupt global shipping, and far enough from Israel to make retaliatory strikes difficult. Unlike Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group that has struck Israel from Lebanon, the Houthis are not beholden to domestic political dynamics -- making them effectively accountable to no one.
  Two senior Israeli defense officials said their intelligence confirmed that Iran's leaders were pushing the regional militias to intensify their attacks against Israel. They said Israel's defense and intelligence circles were alarmed by the recent Houthi attacks and considered the threat serious enough that military intelligence had established a special unit dedicated to threats coming from Yemen. In recent years, they said, Israeli intelligence had also predicted the next war would be fought on multiple fronts, mentioning the Houthis and other Iranian proxies.
  Already, the Houthis have used their proximity to major shipping lanes to attack commercial vessels and threaten U.S. warships. A further escalation along the same routes could disrupt global shipping, analysts said.
  ''We think Houthis in Yemen will become more of a threat to Israel in the long term than Hamas or even Hezbollah,'' said Nasser Imani, a political analyst in Tehran who is close to the government. ''Iran considers them a major player and part of the collective strategy of the resistance axis.''
  On Thursday, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman for President Biden, said the Houthi attacks threatened to escalate tensions in the region: ''It's clearly a risk to the potential widening and deepening of the conflict.''
  The network of Iran-backed regional militias, known as the axis of resistance, includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, as well as several militia groups in Iraq and Syria. Since Israel declared war on Hamas after the group launched a terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, other axis members have opened secondary fronts against Israel in a restrained manner, stopping short of igniting an all-out war. Militias in Iraq and Syria have attacked American military bases more than 70 times with drones and rockets.
  As Israel expands its war in Gaza -- in which more than 15,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed, according to Gazan health officials -- the axis groups have concluded they must significantly raise the prospect of a regional war to force a cease-fire, according to the Iranians affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.
  The new plan includes Houthi attacks on Israeli and American-owned vessels operating in the Red Sea, according to the Iranians affiliated with the Guards. The Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria would also increase their attacks on American military bases with the intent to cause harm and damage, they said.
  An additional aim, they added, is to destabilize maritime security, global shipping and energy supplies.
  Iran's Revolutionary Guards are providing the Houthis with intelligence to help identify Israeli-owned vessels in the Red Sea, said the two Iranians.
  Western officials have said the intelligence is gathered by a ship operated by the Guards near the coast of Yemen. More recently, both a senior Western defense official and one of the Iranians familiar with the planning said Iran also had set up an intelligence outpost in the south of Iran to pass along information on Israeli ships to Houthis.
  Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, has denied, publicly and in a recent interview with The New York Times, that Iran controls the Houthis and other militia groups. But senior Iranian military officials and advisers have said in public speeches and in social media posts that Iran is arming, supporting and coordinating with the militia.
  Despite Iran's plans to use the Houthis as a pawn in a larger regional strategy, Israeli and American intelligence officials said the Houthis presented significant risk of miscalculation and could inadvertently incite a larger regional war that Iranian officials have said they do not want.
  American officials and other experts questioned whether Iran could rein in the Houthis, who launched drones this week at a U.S. Navy destroyer, if their actions got out of control.
  ''This is a difficult game to fine-tune for a group like the Houthis who are not just zealots but also have very little to lose,'' said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. ''There are so many points of tensions. The longer the war goes on, the bigger the risk of tensions getting completely out of control.''
  On Wednesday, the U.S. Navy shot down a Houthi drone launched toward the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a narrow entrance to the Red Sea busy with commercial ships and tankers. The Houthis also said they had fired a barrage of ballistic missiles toward Eilat, Israel.
  The Houthis on Sunday launched attacks against three commercial vessels in the Red Sea. And the American destroyer, the U.S.S. Carney, shot down a Houthi drone that was heading toward it, the Navy said in a statement.
  Gen. Mohammad Ali al-Ghaderi, a Houthi naval commander, said of Sunday's strikes: ''the waters of our land will become the graveyard of the Zionist enemy's ships,'' according to news media reports in Iran and Yemen.
  Washington is taking the threat seriously. This week it dispatched Tim Lenderking, the special envoy for Yemen, to the Persian Gulf for consultations with regional allies on how to safeguard maritime security in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
  In Washington and Tel Aviv, military strategists have contemplated strikes on Yemen to contain the Houthis, two American officials and the senior Western defense official.
  U.S. officials have prepared preliminary Houthi targets in Yemen in case the Biden administration orders retaliatory strikes, the two American officials said, but so far, they added, Washington does not want to risk a wider regional war. Israel has also tempered its response to attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis, limiting its reaction when attacked and relying instead on its defenses.
  Current and former U.S. military commanders said Israel's air defenses were sophisticated enough to knock down missiles and drones launched at Israel, but the threat to international waters was a bigger challenge.
  ''Their ability to hurt Israel is very, very limited,'' said Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the former head of the military's Central Command. ''The bigger risk is if they use mines or short-range cruise missiles in the Bab el-Mandeb.''
  A high-ranking Israeli defense official said that if a Houthi ballistic missile were to hit Israel and cause significant damage or kill civilians, it would be extremely difficult for Israel to not respond.
  In the past few years, Israel has developed strong military and intelligence cooperation with Arab countries in the Persian Gulf, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, that have knowledge of Houthi targets and experience fighting them, according to military analysts.
  One of the Iranian officials familiar with Iran's planning said that the Houthis have said they would respond to any attack inside Yemen by closing the entrance to the Red Sea and indiscriminately firing a barrage of drones and missiles toward ships.

For the past month, normal life in Ramallah -- a city in the West Bank usually known for its young population and its vibrant nightlife -- has been brought to a standstill. 
  Since Hamas's deadly Oct. 7 attacks, Israeli forces have launched numerous raids on the West Bank, arresting people from all walks of life: students, activists, journalists, even individuals posting online in support of Gaza. Air and drone strikes have destroyed houses and streets, targeted numerous refugee camps, and nearly leveled Al-Ansar Mosque. They have pummeled the city of Jenin; last month, Israeli forces destroyed the memorial for an Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh, at the spot where she was killed while reporting more than a year ago.
  Meanwhile, a settlement council has been distributing hundreds of assault rifles to civilian squads in settlements in the northern West Bank, part of a larger effort by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who is a settler himself, to arm civilian groups in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. So far, the ministry has purchased 10,000 assault rifles for such teams around the country. It's part of the atmosphere of escalating violence that has killed more than 130 Palestinians living in the West Bank since Oct. 7.
  For Palestinians, this type of systematic violence is nothing new.
  To many inside and outside this war, the brutality of Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks was unthinkable, as have been the scale and ferocity of Israel's reprisal. But Palestinians have been subject to a steady stream of unfathomable violence -- as well as the creeping annexation of their land by Israel and Israeli settlers -- for generations.
  If people are going to understand this latest conflict and see a path forward for everyone, we need to be more honest, nuanced and comprehensive about the recent decades of history in Gaza, Israel and the West Bank, particularly the impact of occupation and violence on the Palestinians. This story is measured in decades, not weeks; it is not one war, but a continuum of destruction, revenge and trauma.
  Since the 1948 nakba -- in which entire Palestinian villages were wiped off the map and the modern state of Israel was established -- Palestinians have endured a subjugation that has defined their daily lives. For decades, we have been reeling from Israel's military occupation, as well as a succession of deadly invasions and wars. The wars of 1967 and 1973 helped shape the modern geography and geopolitics of the area, with millions of largely stateless Palestinians split between Gaza and the West Bank. In Gaza, often referred to as the world's largest open-air prison, Palestinians are prohibited from entering or leaving, except in incredibly rare circumstances.
  This history has been absent from much of the discourse surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, as though the attacks of Oct. 7 were completely arbitrary. The truth is, even in times of relative peace, Palestinians are second-class citizens in Israel -- if they are deemed citizens at all. According to Israeli law, Palestinians do not have the right to national self-determination, which is reserved for Jewish citizens of the state. A variety of laws restrict Palestinians' right to movement, governing everything from where they can live to what personal identifications they can hold to whether or not they can visit family members elsewhere.
  The ''right of return'' -- the right of Palestinians and their descendants to return to villages they were ethnically cleansed from during the 1948 war -- is central to many Palestinians' political perspective because so many are still, legally, refugees. In Gaza, for instance, roughly two-thirds of the population consists of refugees. This status is not some abstraction; it dictates everything from where people live to which schools they go to or doctors they see.
  Many Gazans have parents and grandparents who grew up only a few miles from where they live now, in areas they are now, of course, forbidden to enter. They still invoke rich memories from their childhood or adolescence, when they walked through citrus groves in Yaffa or olive fields in Qumya -- the latter of which, like many villages whose people were expelled into Gaza during the 1948 war, was later transformed into a kibbutz.
  There have been periods of increased cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians over the past 75 years. But these were usually preceded by times of increased conflict, such as the first and second intifadas, or popular uprisings. The intifadas, in which Palestinians participated in large-scale resistance, sometimes civil and sometimes violent, are often presented by Western media as random or indiscriminate bursts of murderous savagery -- as has been the case with the Oct. 7 attacks. But that violence did not happen in a vacuum.
  Stark conditions in Palestinian communities -- including the ever-tightening control of daily life through violent night raids, arrests, military checkpoints and the building of illegal Israeli settlements -- were the backdrop to these outbursts. Unfortunately, from a historical standpoint, these acts of violence seem to be the only things that have moved the needle politically for Palestinians.
  The death and destruction we Palestinians have collectively witnessed and endured have prolonged our generational trauma. Even before this conflict, PTSD was pervasive in Palestinian homes, as was depression. As a young population, children bear the brunt of Israel's military rule: Many are snatched at night from their beds or from the arms of their mothers, beaten and imprisoned after being tried arbitrarily in military courts. Others are shot and paralyzed, if not killed.
  In Gaza, these victims have virtually no legal possibility of recourse from the Israeli state. Under the 16-year siege of Gaza, Israeli administrators have controlled access to electricity, food and water, at one point determining the number of calories Gazans could consume before sliding into malnutrition. They have also allowed Gaza and the occupied territories to serve as a testing ground for Israel's vaunted security tech firms. Many people from Gaza have risked the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to get out, only to die en route.
  With Gaza sealed for the past 16 years and the West Bank largely contained by settler violence and the army, Israel has been able to keep its occupation indefinite. The periodic spasms of violence -- such as the occasional small group or lone wolf attacks and rocket barrages -- reinforce the state's justification for long-term control of Palestinians and Palestinian lands.
  Over the years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his advisers have been very clear that a separate, sovereign Palestinian state is not on the negotiating table. Neither is the possibility of giving Palestinians the rights that Israelis enjoy. So the status quo of endless occupation -- and regular cycles of violence -- has become normalized, with the international community seemingly unwilling or unable to hold Israel's government to account.
  The Oct. 7 attacks broke that state of play. The occupation's unsustainable nature was laid bare for all to see, as was the impossibility of governing two peoples but privileging one of them over the other.
  Dark days are ahead -- that much we know. Having lived through wars, invasions and bombardments, we have come to expect the worst. In the West Bank, morale is low on the quiet streets. Twenty-four-hour Arabic satellite news stations provide a droning, ubiquitous background to daily life. They play a constant stream of horrific images and videos: all shocking but not unprecedented.
  A feeling of helplessness permeates the West Bank's cities and villages as we watch more and more fellow Palestinians -- now more than 11,100, according to the Gazan health ministry -- lose their lives. Israeli officials have proposed pushing Gaza's population into Egypt's Sinai Desert, which would render them refugees twice or three times over, and perhaps edge the Israeli settler project into a new, more expansive phase. In the West Bank, we look around, and wonder: Could it happen here? Is it happening already?
  Any kind of shared future is most likely a longer way off than it was a month ago. But Palestinians already knew that. Was the day before Hamas's attacks considered peace? Maybe for Israelis it was, but for Palestinians it wasn't.

The Iranian-backed militia in Yemen has launched drone and missile attacks on Israeli and American targets. American officials fear the group could go too far and incite a wider war.
The Houthis, Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen who have launched recent drone and missile attacks on Israeli and American targets, are emerging as an unpredictable and dangerous wild card in the Middle East — the proxies that Iran considers most suited to widening the war with Israel.
Analysts close to the Iranian government said the Houthis’ base in Yemen makes them ideally positioned to escalate fighting in the region, in the hopes of pressuring Israel to end its war with Hamas in Gaza.
The analysts’ assessment tracks with descriptions of a plan by Iran and its network of militias to increase attacks on Israeli and American targets in the region, according to two Iranians affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The Houthis, the analysts said, are Iran’s chosen proxies because from Yemen they are both close enough to the Red Sea’s strategic waterways to disrupt global shipping, and far enough from Israel to make retaliatory strikes difficult. Unlike Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group that has struck Israel from Lebanon, the Houthis are not beholden to domestic political dynamics — making them effectively accountable to no one.
Two senior Israeli defense officials said their intelligence confirmed that Iran’s leaders were pushing the regional militias to intensify their attacks against Israel. They said Israel’s defense and intelligence circles were alarmed by the recent Houthi attacks and considered the threat serious enough that military intelligence had established a special unit dedicated to threats coming from Yemen. In recent years, they said, Israeli intelligence had also predicted the next war would be fought on multiple fronts, mentioning the Houthis and other Iranian proxies.
Already, the Houthis have used their proximity to major shipping lanes to attack commercial vessels and threaten U.S. warships. A further escalation along the same routes could disrupt global shipping, analysts said.
“We think Houthis in Yemen will become more of a threat to Israel in the long term than Hamas or even Hezbollah,” said Nasser Imani, a political analyst in Tehran who is close to the government. “Iran considers them a major player and part of the collective strategy of the resistance axis.”
On Thursday, John F. Kirby, a national security spokesman for President Biden, said the Houthi attacks threatened to escalate tensions in the region: “It’s clearly a risk to the potential widening and deepening of the conflict.”
The network of Iran-backed regional militias, known as the axis of resistance, includes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, as well as several militia groups in Iraq and Syria. Since Israel declared war on Hamas after the group launched a terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, other axis members have opened secondary fronts against Israel in a restrained manner, stopping short of igniting an all-out war. Militias in Iraq and Syria have attacked American military bases more than 70 times with drones and rockets.
As Israel expands its war in Gaza — in which more than 15,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed, according to Gazan health officials — the axis groups have concluded they must significantly raise the prospect of a regional war to force a cease-fire, according to the Iranians affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.
The new plan includes Houthi attacks on Israeli and American-owned vessels operating in the Red Sea, according to the Iranians affiliated with the Guards. The Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria would also increase their attacks on American military bases with the intent to cause harm and damage, they said.
An additional aim, they added, is to destabilize maritime security, global shipping and energy supplies.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards are providing the Houthis with intelligence to help identify Israeli-owned vessels in the Red Sea, said the two Iranians.
Western officials have said the intelligence is gathered by a ship operated by the Guards near the coast of Yemen. More recently, both a senior Western defense official and one of the Iranians familiar with the planning said Iran also had set up an intelligence outpost in the south of Iran to pass along information on Israeli ships to Houthis.
Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, has denied, publicly and in a recent interview with The New York Times, that Iran controls the Houthis and other militia groups. But senior Iranian military officials and advisers have said in public speeches and in social media posts that Iran is arming, supporting and coordinating with the militia.
Despite Iran’s plans to use the Houthis as a pawn in a larger regional strategy, Israeli and American intelligence officials said the Houthis presented significant risk of miscalculation and could inadvertently incite a larger regional war that Iranian officials have said they do not want.
American officials and other experts questioned whether Iran could rein in the Houthis, who launched drones this week at a U.S. Navy destroyer, if their actions got out of control.
“This is a difficult game to fine-tune for a group like the Houthis who are not just zealots but also have very little to lose,” said Ali Vaez, the Iran director of the International Crisis Group. “There are so many points of tensions. The longer the war goes on, the bigger the risk of tensions getting completely out of control.”
On Wednesday, the U.S. Navy shot down a Houthi drone launched toward the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a narrow entrance to the Red Sea busy with commercial ships and tankers. The Houthis also said they had fired a barrage of ballistic missiles toward Eilat, Israel.
The Houthis on Sunday launched attacks against three commercial vessels in the Red Sea. And the American destroyer, the U.S.S. Carney, shot down a Houthi drone that was heading toward it, the Navy said in a statement.
Gen. Mohammad Ali al-Ghaderi, a Houthi naval commander, said of Sunday’s strikes: “the waters of our land will become the graveyard of the Zionist enemy’s ships,” according to news media reports in Iran and Yemen.
Washington is taking the threat seriously. This week it dispatched Tim Lenderking, the special envoy for Yemen, to the Persian Gulf for consultations with regional allies on how to safeguard maritime security in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
In Washington and Tel Aviv, military strategists have contemplated strikes on Yemen to contain the Houthis, two American officials and the senior Western defense official.
U.S. officials have prepared preliminary Houthi targets in Yemen in case the Biden administration orders retaliatory strikes, the two American officials said, but so far, they added, Washington does not want to risk a wider regional war. Israel has also tempered its response to attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis, limiting its reaction when attacked and relying instead on its defenses.
Current and former U.S. military commanders said Israel’s air defenses were sophisticated enough to knock down missiles and drones launched at Israel, but the threat to international waters was a bigger challenge.
“Their ability to hurt Israel is very, very limited,” said Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the former head of the military’s Central Command. “The bigger risk is if they use mines or short-range cruise missiles in the Bab el-Mandeb.”
A high-ranking Israeli defense official said that if a Houthi ballistic missile were to hit Israel and cause significant damage or kill civilians, it would be extremely difficult for Israel to not respond.
In the past few years, Israel has developed strong military and intelligence cooperation with Arab countries in the Persian Gulf, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, that have knowledge of Houthi targets and experience fighting them, according to military analysts.
One of the Iranian officials familiar with Iran’s planning said that the Houthis have said they would respond to any attack inside Yemen by closing the entrance to the Red Sea and indiscriminately firing a barrage of drones and missiles toward ships.

On Oct. 7, Hamas and other militant groups launched an attack in Israel that killed hundreds. Israel responded with a military campaign that has devastated Gaza.
Two months ago, on Oct. 7, Hamas and other militant groups based in Gaza launched a cross-border attack in Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a military campaign to eradicate Hamas that has devastated Gaza, with the Gazan health authorities saying that more than 15,000 people have been killed, most of them women and children. Israel’s military estimates that it has killed several thousand Hamas fighters.
Here is a timeline of some key events in the war:
Oct. 7: Hamas and other militant groups fire thousands of rockets into Israel and gunmen infiltrate border communities, army bases and an outdoor music festival, killing hundreds and abducting about 240 people. It is the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating reports that the attackers committed widespread sexual violence.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel says in a televised statement that the country is “at war,” and he calls up thousands of military reservists.
Oct. 9: Israel orders a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip, saying that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” will be allowed into the enclave. Its military pounds Gaza with airstrikes amid signs that it is preparing for a ground invasion.
Oct. 10: Israeli troops mostly retake control of towns near the Gaza Strip from Palestinian gunmen.
Oct. 11: Mr. Netanyahu forms an emergency government, adding two opposition lawmakers, both former army chiefs, to his cabinet.
Oct. 13: Israel’s military orders civilians to evacuate northern Gaza, sparking panic and chaos as thousands move south.
Oct. 17: An explosion outside the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City kills and wounds many people. Palestinian officials blame an Israeli strike. Israeli and American intelligence agencies say that a failed Palestinian rocket launch caused the explosion.
Oct. 18: President Biden visits Israel, where he embraces Mr. Netanyahu and says in a speech that he understands Israel’s “all-consuming rage.” He also warns Israeli leaders about what he says were mistakes the United States made after the 9/11 attacks.
Oct. 20: Hamas releases two American hostages held in Gaza, Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, after negotiations involving officials in Qatar. Days later, it releases two more hostages, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, and, Nurit Cooper, 79.
Oct. 27: Amid heavy airstrikes, and shrouded in secrecy and ambiguity, Israel launches a ground invasion into north Gaza from three directions. Cellphone and internet service in the enclave is cut off.
Oct. 31: Israel’s military strikes the Jabaliya neighborhood north of Gaza City with two 2,000-pound bombs, killing dozens of people and wounding hundreds, according to Gazan health officials. Israel says it was targeting a Hamas commander.
Nov. 6: Israel’s military says it has effectively surrounded Gaza City and split Gaza into north and south.
Nov. 15: Israel’s military storms Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, which it says doubles as a Hamas military command center, an allegation that Hamas denies. Israel later says it discovered weapons and other evidence that supports its assertions that Hamas operated in a network of tunnels under the complex.
Nov. 24: Israel and Hamas pause fighting in a deal that allows for the release of 102 hostages and for more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails over the course of several days. It also allows for the delivery of more aid to Gaza’s civilians.
Dec. 2: The truce collapses. The Israeli military heavily bombards southern Gaza, claiming to strike more than 400 targets, and orders residents to evacuate several towns and villages, spreading confusion and fear as people sought shelter.
Dec. 5: The Israeli military describes house-to-house gun battles with Hamas fighters in the southern city of Khan Younis. Civilians and aid workers describe some of the heaviest bombardment of the conflict and deteriorating humanitarian conditions.

I confess that as a longtime observer of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I aggressively avoid both the ''From the river to the sea'' activists on the pro-Palestinian left and the similarly partisan zealots on the ''Greater Israel'' Zionist right -- not just because I find their exclusivist visions for the future abhorrent but also because the reporter in me finds them so blind to the complexities of the present.
They aren't thinking about the Jewish mother in Jerusalem who told me in one breath how she just got a gun license to protect her kids from Hamas, and in the next about how much she trusted her kids' Palestinian Arab teacher, who rushed her children to the school bomb shelter during a recent Hamas air raid. They aren't thinking about Alaa Amara, the Israeli Arab shop owner from Taibe, who donated 50 bicycles to Jewish kids who survived the Hamas attack on their border communities on Oct. 7, only to see his shop torched, apparently by hard-line nationalist Israeli Arab youth, a few days later, only to see a crowdfunding campaign in Hebrew and English raise more than $200,000 to help him rebuild that same shop just a few days after that. 
  Over the last half-century, I have seen Palestinians and Israelis do terrible things to one another. But this episode that began with the barbaric Hamas attack on Israelis, including women, little kids and soldiers in communities alongside Gaza, and the Israeli retaliation against Hamas fighters embedded in Gaza that has also killed, wounded and displaced so many thousands of Palestinian civilians -- from newborns to the elderly -- is surely the worst since the 1947 U.N. partition days.
  But those on all sides who read this column know that I am not one for keeping score. My focus is always on how to get out of this eye-for-an-eye, tooth-for-a-tooth horror show before everyone is left blind and toothless.
  To that end, I devoted a lot of time on my trip to Israel and the West Bank this month observing and probing the actual day-to-day interactions among Israeli Arabs and Jews. These are always complex, sometimes surprising, occasionally depressing -- and, more often than you might expect, uplifting -- experiences. Because they reveal enough seeds of coexistence scattered around that one can still dream the impossible dream -- that we might one day have a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River.
  So, this Thanksgiving week, I ask you to spare a few moments with me to reflect on some of these people, including some of the extraordinary acts of rescue that they committed on Oct. 7. They will give you more faith in humanity than the headlines around this story would ever suggest.
  To put it another way, a friend once described my worldview as a cross between Thomas Hobbes and Walter Mondale. For several days on my trip, I let out my inner Mondale to chase some rays of hope shooting through the darkness.
  It began soon after I arrived in Tel Aviv, when I sat down with perhaps the most courageous Israeli political leader today, Mansour Abbas. Abbas is a Palestinian Arab citizen of Israel who happens to be a devout Muslim and a member of Israel's parliament, where he leads the important United Arab List party. Abbas's voice is even more vital now because he did not respond to the Hamas terrorism with silence. Abbas understands that while it's right to be outraged at the pain Israel is inflicting on Gaza's civilians, reserving all of your outrage for Gaza's pain creates suspicion among Jews in Israel and worldwide, who notice when not a word is uttered about the Hamas atrocities that triggered this war.
  The first thing Abbas said to me about the Hamas onslaught was this: ''No one can accept what happened on that day. And we cannot condemn it and say 'but' -- that word 'but' has become immoral.'' (Recent polls show overwhelming Israeli Arab condemnation of the Hamas attack.)
  Abbas sees the complexities lived by that Israeli Jewish mother in Jerusalem who never lost trust in her kids' Palestinian Arab teacher, and by that Israeli Arab bicycle shop owner who spontaneously reached out a hand to ease the pain of Jewish children he'd never met. At the same time, though, Abbas spoke about the searing pain Israeli Palestinian Arabs and Bedouins feel at seeing their relatives pummeled and killed in Gaza.
  ''One of the hardest things today is to be an Israeli Arab,'' Abbas said to me. ''The Arab Israeli feels the pain twice -- once as an Arab and once as an Israeli.''
  That's the thing about this neighborhood: If you only look at one group or the other under a microscope, you want to cry -- the brutal massacre of Jews, the harsh treatment of Palestinians by Jewish supremacist settlers. The list is endless. But if you look at their stories through a kaleidoscope, observing the complexity of their interactions, you can see hope. If you want to report accurately about Israelis and Palestinians, always bring a kaleidoscope.
  Which brings me to the stories of the Israeli Bedouin Arabs and Oct. 7.
  About a week into my trip, I got a call from my friend Avrum Burg, the former speaker of the Israeli Knesset, whose grandfather was the chief rabbi of Hebron in 1929. He told me that he and his pal Talab el-Sana -- an Israeli Bedouin Arab who served with him in the Knesset, and who provided a key vote that gave Yitzhak Rabin the majority that enabled him to make the Oslo peace deal -- wanted to take me to meet some ''righteous Bedouins.'' These were Arabic-speaking but Hebrew-fluent Muslim-Bedouin citizens of Israel, who had played heroic roles in saving Jews from Hamas's attack.
  Bedouins in Israel are a nomadic community who largely reside in Israel's Negev Desert and are part of the Israeli Arab minority -- 21 percent of the country -- spread across cities and towns. There are some 320,000 Bedouins in Israel, with about 200,000 living in government-recognized communities and about 120,000 in makeshift, unrecognized shantytowns. Many Bedouins have served in the Israeli Army, often as trackers, because of their deep knowledge of the area's geography from generations of roaming desert terrain.
  Well, it turns out that some Israeli Bedouins who lived near or worked in the border communities ravaged by Hamas helped to rescue Israeli Jews there. Some Bedouins got abducted by Hamas along with Jews, while others were murdered by Hamas because the terrorist group treated anyone who lived or worked in Israeli kibbutzim and spoke Hebrew as ''Jews'' -- deserving to be killed.
  And after Oct. 7, some of those Bedouins who saved Israeli Jews found themselves being treated to hostile glances and quiet slurs by other Israeli Jews, who automatically assumed they were Hamas sympathizers.
  And all along, both Jewish and Bedouin victims of Hamas were treated together in Israeli hospitals, where nearly half of all the new incoming doctors are now Israeli Arabs or Druze, as are some 24 percent of the nurses and roughly 50 percent of the pharmacists.
  Yup, an Israeli Bedouin Arab can save an Israeli Jew on the Gaza border in the morning, be discriminated against by Jews on the streets of Beersheba in the afternoon and boast that his daughter -- a doctor, trained at an Israeli medical school -- stayed on her feet all night taking care of Jewish and Arab patients at Hadassah Hospital.
  It's complicated.
  El-Sana and Burg took me to two Bedouin villages to meet young men who saved Jews. Joining us was Ran Wolf, an Israeli urban planner who specializes in building shared spaces -- innovation centers, cultural centers and markets -- to be used by both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs. We stopped at Ran's home in Tel Aviv on the way to get some water, where he told me this story:
  After the Hamas rockets started falling on Tel Aviv on Oct. 7, he called his regular contractor, Emad, an Israeli Arab from Jaffa, to say that the doors on the bomb shelter in his basement couldn't be closed. ''The problem was happening in a lot of shelters, and after Oct. 7 everyone wanted to get theirs fixed,'' said Wolf. Indeed, when his neighbors got wind that a repairman was on the block, they asked him to fix theirs, too.
  ''Emad is a good friend, and he refused to take any money for two days of work,'' said Wolf. Keep in mind, he added, that Emad lives in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv. In the 1948 war, Emad's father stayed in Jaffa and his uncle fled to Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. ''So he was raised in Israel -- but half his family is now in Gaza,'' Wolf said. ''He himself got a Hamas missile 200 yards from his home in Jaffa'' the other day, he added.
  Get out your kaleidoscope: Today you have Jaffa Palestinian refugees living under a Hamas government in Gaza who are firing rockets at Jaffa Palestinians who are Israeli citizens, one of whom repaired the rocket shelters of his Jewish friends in Tel Aviv -- for free.
  When we arrived in Rahat, the largest Bedouin town in Israel in the Negev Desert, el-Sana, sitting in the back seat of the car, managed to one-up that story.
  He explained that some of the first Israeli victims of the Hamas rocket attacks on Oct. 7 were actually Bedouins, many of whom live in unrecognized villages in the Negev that are not listed on any digital maps. (The Israeli government has not kept up with their population growth, as it has for most Jewish towns.)
  Those villages do not have municipal bomb shelters or warning sirens to protect their people when Hamas rockets start landing, but -- and you cannot make this up -- el-Sana explained that the way Israel's Iron Dome antimissile system works is that when Hamas launches a rocket it automatically plots the trajectory to determine if that rocket from Gaza will land on a settled space in Israel, and kill people, or on an empty field or in the sea. If it is an empty space on a map or in the sea, Iron Dome won't waste one of its expensive rockets shooting down a cheap Hamas rocket.
  Six Bedouins were killed by a Hamas rocket that landed on their village of Al Bat -- including two brothers, ages 11 and 12 -- because that Bedouin town is not on any official Israeli map loaded into the Iron Dome database, el-Sana explained.
  Meanwhile, eight other Bedouins who worked in Jewish communities near Gaza were murdered by Hamas and at least seven more Bedouins, all Israeli citizens, are believed to have been kidnapped and taken to Gaza.
  And yet days later some of these same Bedouins did not hesitate to help rescue Israeli Jews, along with their cousins.
  El-Sana had set up an interview for me in Al Zayada village, an unrecognized Bedouin settlement in the Negev, at the unrecognized home of Youssef Ziadna, 47, a Bedouin driver who had been recognized for rescuing Jews on Oct. 7. Ziadna, a bus driver, explained that on Friday, Oct. 6, he was hired to drive a group of Jewish kids to an outdoor trance music festival called the Supernova Sukkot Gathering, celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, adjacent to Kibbutz Re'im, which is adjacent to the Gaza border.
  ''After I dropped them off, we agreed that on Saturday I would come back and take them home at 6 p.m.,'' he told me. But early on Saturday morning, ''I got a call from one of them, Amit,'' telling him to come immediately, he said. ''They were being attacked and there was gunfire everywhere.''
  As he rushed to the scene and got near the kibbutz, Ziadna said, ''I saw a barrage of rockets and many cars coming toward me -- escaping -- blinking their lights for me to turn around. Some people who stopped and jumped out of their cars said there were terrorists in Be'eri, so 'run away.' I got out of my car and hid on the side of the road and every time I raised my head I got shot at. But I committed to pick these people up, and it was a kilometer away.''
  Ziadna said that when the shooting subsided for a bit, he managed to get back in his vehicle and use his cellphone to link up with Amit and his friends -- and anyone else he could cram into his minibus. Instead of driving back on the road, where ''I knew they'd kill us,'' he said, ''I drove through the fields.''
  As a Bedouin, Ziadna had intimate knowledge of the terrain that proved lifesaving. He was able to cut a route through fields and avoid the main thoroughfare near where Hamas terrorists were ambushing escapees from the music festival. Many other escaping cars then also jumped off the road and followed Ziadna's minibus through the fields, he said. He told The Times of Israel, which profiled him, that he crammed some 30 people into his vehicle, even though it was licensed for only 14 passengers.
  A few days later, he said he got a call from a phone number he did not recognize but that he believed was from Gaza, and a voice said in Arabic: ''Are you Youssef Ziadna? You saved the lives of Jews? We're going to kill you.''
  He reported the call to the Israeli police. It's just one reason, he said, that he still needs daily phone calls with a psychologist to try to overcome his trauma from Oct. 7.
  Another family member at our gathering, Daham Ziadna, 35, said a total of four of their family members were abducted by Hamas; one was killed for sure, and three others are still missing. Two of them were last seen lying on the ground in a TikTok video released by Hamas, with two gun-toting Hamas fighters standing over them. For Hamas, said Daham, ''everyone who lives in Israel is a Jew.''
  Daham told me that a few days ago he had gone to the local bank to withdraw some money from the A.T.M., and two Israeli Jews passed him on the sidewalk. ''One had a Russian accent. As they walked past me, the Russian guy said, 'Here's another Arab.' I said to him: 'These ''Arabs'' you are talking about on the morning of Oct. 7 were on the border of Gaza fighting for the Israeli state -- regardless of Jews or Arabs -- and the ones who destroy the country are people like you who incite poison.'''
  Israeli Arabs live between a rock and a hard place, he added: ''Many Jews look at us as if we are all Hamas, and the Hamas people look at us as if we are all Jews.''
  A few miles away, in Rahat, el-Sana introduced me to the al-Qrinawi family, who had their own remarkable tale to tell. Their family spokesman, Ismail, led me through the drama, flanked by his male cousins and a giant platter of rice, chicken and chickpeas.
  On the morning of Oct. 7, as word spread of the Hamas attack, they discovered through their family's WhatsApp group that three of their cousins who worked in the dining room at Kibbutz Be'eri had apparently been abducted. Around 10 a.m., one family member got a call from the phone of an Israeli woman named Aya Medan that was strange. It turned out she had met up with one of their missing cousins, Hisham, and they were hiding together from the Hamas terrorists in the same thorny bush near Be'eri. Hisham used her cellphone to call his Bedouin clan for help. Their other two cousins had fled in another direction.
  Their uncle, the family patriarch, ordered four of his nephews to get in the family Land Cruiser and go rescue them, since the area was normally about 30 minutes away -- but not that day. They grabbed two handguns and sped off.
  ''When we got close, we found that all the roads were closed,'' Ismail told me. ''So we went through the woods and through a deep wadi in order to go around. Our car almost flipped over in the wadi.''
  First, ''we bumped into people running away from the party,'' he said. ''We gave them our phones to call their parents and made sure that they got into other cars that were driven by Israelis. We managed to rescue 30 or 40 people at the party. But all the time, I am talking to Aya, trying to locate her and Hisham.''
  It was taking forever. After two and a half hours of dodging gunfire and Hamas rockets, Ismail said, they managed to find Aya and Hisham hiding in bushes very close to Kibbutz Be'eri. The two had sent a cellphone picture of the area where they were hiding so they could be more easily located. Minutes later, Aya recalled for The Times of Israel, Hisham tugged at her, saying, ''Aya, they're here, they're actually here.''
  The cousins opened the car doors, Aya and Hisham scrambled inside and the Bedouins again used their off-road skills to get them to safety. Sort of.
  The most terrifying moment of the day, Ismail told me, was when they got back onto a main road. They got stopped at a makeshift Israeli Army checkpoint, with jittery Israeli soldiers who could not identify friend or foe from afar. ''The Israeli soldiers surrounded our car and every one of them was pointing a gun at us. I shouted: 'We're Israeli citizens! Don't shoot!'''
  Aya told The Times of Israel that she was asked by an Israeli soldier whether she was being kidnapped. She said, ''No, I'm from Be'eri, and they came from Rahat to get us out of there.''
  Bedouins saving Israeli Jews from Hamas being saved by a rescued Israeli Jewish woman from being shot by the Israeli Army after they rescued her ... kaleidoscopic.
  While I was interviewing the al-Qrinawi family, they introduced me to Shir Nosatzki, a co-founder of the Israeli group Have You Seen the Horizon Lately, which promotes Jewish-Arab partnerships. Immediately after learning of the rescue, her husband, Regev Contes, made a seven-minute video in Hebrew to share the tale of the Bedouin rescue team with his fellow Israelis. It has reportedly garnered hundreds of thousands of views in Israel. I asked Nosatzki why they made the video.
  ''It was to show that Oct. 7 was not a war between Jews and Arabs but between darkness and light,'' she said.
  Before driving back to Tel Aviv, el-Sana insisted on taking us to his favorite kebab restaurant in Rahat. There we sat: an Israeli Bedouin who had served in the Knesset, the grandson of the former chief rabbi of Hebron and a Jewish New York Times columnist from Minnesota who had reported from both Beirut and Jerusalem in the 1970s and 1980s. We reflected on the day in a crazy mix of Hebrew, Arabic and English.
  Between grilled lamb and hummus, we all came to the same conclusion: Even at this dark hour, we had just seen something hugely important -- ''the seeds of coexistence, in death and in life,'' as Burg put it, seeds that Hamas set out to destroy. These seeds, el-Sana added, ''should give us hope that we can build a common future based on common values that cross borders of Jewish and Arab ethnicity.''
  They are right. These seeds, small as they might be, have never been more important than they are right now. Why? Because this Israel-Hamas war, whenever it ends, has been so traumatic for everyone already that it will trigger the biggest debate about what the relations and boundaries between Israelis and Palestinians should be since the U.N. partition plan in 1947. I am sure of it -- because anything less will mean permanent war.
  I can already tell you that there will be a lot of destructive voices in that discussion: Palestinian and Arab Hamas apologists, who are already denying or playing down Hamas's atrocities; Jewish supremacist settlers, eager not only to expand in the West Bank but also, insanely, to Gaza, and who show no apparent concern for the devastating suffering of Palestinian civilians killed in Israel's retaliation there; Benjamin Netanyahu, who will sell Israel's future down the river to stay in office and out of jail; and Hamas's useful idiots in the West, particularly on campuses, where students denounce all of Israel as a colonial enterprise while chanting ''From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.''
  (Please spare me the explanation that this is really a call for coexistence: I was in Beirut in the 1970s when this chant was popular, and I can assure you it was not a call for two states for two peoples. If you have a mantra that needs 15 minutes to explain, you need a new mantra.)
  Given all these wrecking crews waiting to go to work, we are going to need more than ever to elevate the authentic voices of coexistence -- leaders with the integrity of those Israeli Bedouins, ready to do and say the right things, not only when it is not easy but also when it's dangerous.
  Which brings me back to Mansour Abbas of the United Arab List.
  His party, broadly speaking, comes from the same Muslim Brotherhood wing of Palestinian politics as Hamas -- only where Hamas worships violence and exclusion, Abbas advocates nonviolence and inclusion. Abbas was a key power broker helping Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid forge Israel's 2021 national unity government. Netanyahu, ever the divider, brought that government down in part with anti-Arab and anti-Muslim tropes directed at Abbas.
  Abbas understands that coexistence means saying the right things, not only when it's politically difficult but also when it's dangerous. After viewing videos of the Hamas attack in the Knesset, he told Arabic Radio al-Nas about Oct. 7: ''I saw a father with two children who went into a bomb shelter outside their home, and they threw a grenade into the shelter. The father jumped on the grenade and was killed, and the two children were wounded and remained alive. The massacre is against everything we believe in, our religion, our Islam, our nationality, our humanity.'' Hamas's actions do ''not represent our Arab society, nor our Palestinian people, nor our Palestinian nation.''
  In our interview, Abbas told me that we need ''a new political rhetoric'' and not to get drawn back into the old games. ''This 'river to the sea' talk is not helpful,'' he said. ''They are making a mistake. If you want to help Palestinians, then talk about a two-state solution and peace and security for all the people.''
  That is why, he added, ''I am working on a plan that starts by ending the current war and ends with the creation of a Palestinian state alongside of Israel.''
  Abbas is cleareyed about the difficult road ahead. I am, too. I finished my recent journey with two takeaways. The first is that this Gaza war is still far from over. Israel believes there will be no peace in or from Gaza as long as Hamas is in power there.
  But the other is that just as the darkness of the Yom Kippur War produced the dawn of the Camp David treaty, and just as the viciousness of the first intifada and the Israeli pushback led to the Oslo Accords, out of the horrors of Oct. 7 will one day come another attempt to build two states for these two indigenous peoples. Otherwise, this whole corner of the world will become uninhabitable for any sane person. There are just too many people with too many powerful weapons today.
  And when that day comes, it will take a bridge-builder like Mansour Abbas -- who understands the true kaleidoscopic reality of this place, and the authentic connection of both communities to it -- to nurture the seeds of coexistence that are still here, albeit buried deeper than ever. Abbas, Youssef Ziadna, the al-Qrinawi family, Aya Medan, my friends Avrum, Talab and Ran -- they will be the rescuers.

Battles Rage Near Gaza Hospital, Forcing Scores of Civilians to Flee

Israel and Hamas are battling near a hospital in Khan Younis, near where the military said it had detected mortar fire. About 7,000 people had sought shelter on the hospital grounds, the U.N. said.
Scores of displaced Palestinians fled the grounds of a hospital in southern Gaza as fighting raged on Wednesday in and around the city of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military says it is trying to crush a Hamas stronghold. 
  Videos verified by The New York Times show families fleeing the hospital, Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis, carrying duffel bags, backpacks and blankets as the sound of explosions reverberated. The Israeli military said this week that they had detected mortar fire aimed at its forces from the hospital complex, the largest in the southern Gaza Strip.
  The fighting around the hospital underlines the dangers for civilians in southern Gaza as the Israeli military converges on Khan Younis. About 7,000 people were believed to have been sheltering on the hospital's grounds, the United Nations' humanitarian office said on Wednesday, adding that an ''intensification of hostilities'' in the area also made it harder for patients and health workers to get access to the hospital.
  Many displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza have relocated several times since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, an experience that has reinforced the feeling that nowhere is safe in the enclave. The Gazan health authorities say that more than 24,000 people, including women and children, have been killed in the enclave since then.
  Hamas's Khan Younis brigade is among the armed group's last major forces, as their fighters in northern Gaza have been largely subdued, according to Israeli military officials. Israeli troops, led by the military's 98th division, have been advancing into the Palestinian city since December, after the collapse of a brief cease-fire with Hamas.
  Civilians, many of whom fled northern Gaza following Israeli evacuation orders, have taken refuge in makeshift tent cities, overflowing schools and on the grounds of hospitals.
  The battles for southern Gaza, Israeli military officials say, are extremely challenging because of the presence of those civilians and Hamas's tactic of embedding weapons and fighters among the population and around civilian infrastructure.
  The fighting is further complicated by a network of war tunnels that Hamas constructed beneath the enclave, at times running beneath residential areas and, in at least one known instance, accessible from the grounds of a hospital.
  Top Hamas leaders such as Yahya Sinwar -- a native son of Khan Younis -- may be hiding in fortified tunnels underneath his hometown, Israeli officials say. If so, they add, he has most likely surrounded himself with some of the more than 100 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza -- another stumbling block.
  The southern portion of the Gaza Strip is about seven miles wide. But in a measure of the difficulty Israel is having in gaining control of that part of Gaza, the military said on Wednesday it had airdropped 16 tons of ammunition, fuel, water and food for its troops there.
  Amid the Israeli airstrikes and intense fighting, hospitals in Gaza have struggled to deal with a seemingly constant stream of wounded people, grossly inadequate medical supplies, unsanitary conditions and significant staffing challenges.
  The United Nations said on Wednesday that Nasser and two other major hospitals in Gaza were at risk of being shut down because of evacuation orders for areas next to the medical facilities, as well as fighting close by.
  The World Health Organization reported that Nasser hospital alone treated 700 patients on Monday, double its usual daily caseload, requiring some patients to be cared for on the floor. Only 15 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partly functional, the W.H.O. said.
  Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals for military purposes, and its raid on Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza revealed a stone-and-concrete tunnel shaft below the hospital. Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa Hospital in November, a move that officials from the Gaza Health Ministry said put the hospital out of service at the time.
  Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman of the Israeli military, said on Tuesday that the army had detected the launch of a munition from the Nasser complex toward Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military later clarified that he had been referring to mortar fire.
  ''The Hamas terrorist organization systematically operates in Gaza's hospitals and nearby areas using civilians as human shields,'' he wrote on social media.
  Hamas denies its fighters have used hospitals as bases for their operations.
  The Times was not able to reach medical workers at the hospital on Wednesday as a near-total communications blackout across the Gaza Strip continued for a sixth consecutive day, leaving besieged civilians unable to call for help and aid workers struggling to reach them as Israeli airstrikes rained down on the south.
  Paltel, the strip's largest telecommunications company, said the blackout was the longest of several Gaza had faced since the start of the war.
  Airstrikes and fighting between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants in Khan Younis have been so intense that repair crews have had trouble reaching the damaged sites, Paltel said. Last week, two of its workers, in the process of making repairs, were killed when a company car was fired upon, Paltel said, adding that it had coordinated the repairs with the Israeli authorities in advance. The Israeli military said the episode had been referred for investigation.
  Even as the fighting continued, some officials were looking ahead to reconstruction once hostilities had ended. Rebuilding housing will cost at least $15 billion, Mohammad Mustafa, the chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund, whose board is appointed by the president of the Palestinian Authority, said on Wednesday. Speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, Mr. Mustafa said the estimate did not include hospitals and infrastructure damaged or destroyed.
  The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, who was also in Davos, said on Wednesday that the civilian suffering in Gaza was ''gut wrenching'' and that American officials had spoken to Israeli officials about their responsibility to minimize civilian casualties and facilitate humanitarian aid.
  Mr. Blinken's comments, while cast in unusually sharp language, were also a defense of the Biden administration's approach to the conflict, in which it has strongly backed Israel's war against Hamas while pressing Israeli officials to limit harm to Palestinian civilians.
  ''The suffering we're seeing among innocent men, women and children breaks my heart,'' he said in response to questions by The Times columnist Thomas Friedman. ''The question is, what is to be done?''
  ''We've made judgments about how we thought we could be most effective in trying to shape this in ways to get more humanitarian assistance to people to get better protections and minimize civilian casualties,'' he went on. ''Every step along the way, not only have we impressed upon Israel its responsibilities to do that, we've seen some progress in areas where, absent our engagement, I don't believe it would have happened.''
  Mr. Blinken's comments were consistent with the U.S. government's broad political and military support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza, which began after the Hamas-led attack killed about 1,200 people and more than 200 others were taken hostage on Oct. 7, Israeli officials said. 
  Also on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had killed a Palestinian militant commander, Abdullah Abu Shalal, alongside several fellow fighters in the occupied West Bank in an airstrike targeting their vehicle.
  The army described Mr. Abu Shalal as the commander of a militant cell based in the city of Nablus that was planning an ''imminent'' attack against Israelis. Palestinian officials said the men were members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, an armed group loosely affiliated with Fatah, the dominant Palestinian political faction in the West Bank.

Also, an election upset in Pakistan. Here’s the latest at the end of Monday.
A raid by Israeli special forces in the southern Gazan city of Rafah this morning secured the freedom of two hostages of Hamas, the military said, the second known rescue of its kind in Gaza since the start of the war. To provide cover, Israel’s military said it had launched a wave of attacks, which Gaza’s health ministry said resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.
The two men who were rescued are dual citizens of Israel and Argentina. Here’s the latest.
The operations were met with elation in Israel, where hostage recovery is a top priority, and fear in Gaza. More than a million Palestinians have crowded into Rafah, many of whom have fled their homes during the war. Some Palestinians worry that the raid was just the beginning of extended Israeli operations in the city.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that Israeli ground forces will eventually enter Rafah with the goal of eliminating Hamas battalions there, despite U.S. warnings that an attack on the city would be disastrous.
The Senate is poised to advance Ukraine aid
Eighteen Senate Republicans are expected to buck their party tonight and join Democrats in advancing a $95 billion foreign aid package, which includes assistance for Ukraine and Israel.
The legislation would direct around $60 billion toward helping Ukraine fight off Russia’s invasion, around $14 billion toward Israel’s war against Hamas, and almost $10 billion toward humanitarian aid for civilians in conflict zones, including Palestinians in Gaza. The package is opposed by the majority of Republican senators and Republican leaders in the House and, perhaps most notably, Donald Trump.
The support from the Republicans, mainly national security hawks, would put the package on track to pass the Senate within days. The legislation’s fate in the House remains uncertain.
Finland’s new president faces an unlikely first test: Trump
Finland, NATO’s newest member state, elected Alexander Stubb as president yesterday, elevating a pro-U.S. candidate who had pushed for a stronger trans-Atlantic partnership. However, Stubb will enter office at a time when U.S. politics have thrown the future of the NATO alliance into doubt.
Trump, the likely Republican nominee, said this weekend that, if re-elected, he would “encourage” Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” against NATO allies that do not contribute sufficiently to collective defense. Many top Republicans defended the former president. His comments are a harsh reminder to many European nations that banking on Washington in the face of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is no longer as sure a bet as it seemed.
An election upset in Pakistan
In a shocking result this weekend, the party of Pakistan’s imprisoned former prime minister, Imran Khan, won the most seats in Pakistan’s parliamentary elections, despite the military’s efforts to suppress support.
The result humiliated the country’s powerful generals, upended most political forecasts and created a political crisis. Now both Khan’s party and his rivals are jockeying to win enough support to lead the government.

ONE LAST THING
A tiny view inside a royal palace
An exhibit at Windsor Castle, the British royal family’s opulent residence, offers visitors an intimate view of what royal life looked like a century ago. It includes up-close views of the grand dining room, landscaped gardens and a replica of the Imperial State Crown — but at one-twelfth the scale.
The exhibit is celebrating the centenary of a doll house that was given to Queen Mary, the grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II, in 1924. Mary was 57 at the time, and the house was never intended to be played with by children. Instead, it was designed to depict the best of British craftsmanship as a gift for a royal who loved all things miniature.
Have a charming evening.

How a Tunnel Under a Hospital May Have Been Used by Hamas

Gaza's hospitals have emerged as a focal point in Israel's war with Hamas, with each side citing how the other has pulled the centers into the conflict as proof of the enemy's disregard for the safety of civilians.
In four months of war, Israeli troops have entered several hospitals, including the Qatari Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Rantisi Specialized Hospital for Children, to search for weapons and fighters. But Al-Shifa Hospital has taken on particular significance because it is Gaza's largest medical facility, and because of Israel's claims that Hamas leaders operated a command-and-control center beneath it. Hamas and the hospital's staff insisted it was only a medical center. 
  Al-Shifa's value as a military target was not immediately clear in the days after the Nov. 15 raid, even after the Israeli military released the tunnel video that The Times used to create a 3-D model.
  But evidence examined by The New York Times suggests Hamas used the hospital for cover, stored weapons inside it and maintained a hardened tunnel beneath the complex that was supplied with water, power and air-conditioning.
  Classified Israeli intelligence documents, obtained and reviewed by The Times, indicate that the tunnel is at least 700 feet long, twice as long as the military revealed publicly, and that it extends beyond the hospital and likely connects to Hamas's larger underground network.
  According to classified images reviewed by The Times, Israeli soldiers found underground bunkers, living quarters and a room that appeared to be wired for computers and communications equipment along a part of the tunnel beyond the hospital -- chambers that were not visible in the video released by the Israeli military.
  The Israeli military, however, has struggled to prove that Hamas maintained a command-and-control center under the hospital. Critics of the Israeli military say the evidence does not support its early claims, noting that it had distributed material before the raid showing five underground complexes and also had said the tunnel network could be reached from wards inside a hospital building. Israel has publicly revealed the existence of only one tunnel entrance on the grounds of the hospital, at the shack outside its main buildings.
  The Israeli military says that it moved carefully because the tunnel was booby-trapped and ran out of time to investigate before it destroyed the tunnel and withdrew from the hospital. Israeli and Qatari officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Israel had to leave the hospital to comply with the terms of a temporary cease-fire in late November.
  American officials have said their own intelligence backs up the Israeli case, including evidence that Hamas used Al-Shifa to hold at least a few hostages. American intelligence also indicates that Hamas fighters evacuated the complex days before Israeli forces moved into Al-Shifa, destroying documents and electronics as they left.
  Hospitals are protected under international law, even if they provide medical care for combatants, but their use for other acts that are ''harmful to the enemy'' can make them legitimate targets for military action. But any action must weigh the expected military advantage against the expected harm to civilians.
  Al-Shifa, Israeli officials have argued, is an example of Hamas's willingness to use hospitals as cover and turn civilians into human shields. But critics say it is also an example of the toll on civilians when Israeli forces surround and raid hospitals to pursue Hamas fighters or rescue hostages, operations that can cut off doctors from fuel and supplies and residents from urgently needed medical care.
  Five premature babies died at Al-Shifa before the raid ''due to lack of electricity and fuel,'' according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which helped organize the evacuation of 31 other infants.
  ''We all know that the health care system is or has collapsed,'' Lynn Hastings, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, has told reporters.
  Israel launched its war in Gaza after the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, in which around 1,200 people were killed and over 200 were taken hostage. Since the start of the war, more than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there.
  In the face of international opprobrium over its raids on hospitals, Israel has publicized evidence that it says shows that Hamas hid fighters among the ill and injured, and held hostages in the facilities. The Israeli military said that before entering Al-Shifa, it warned the buildings' occupants, opened evacuation routes and sent Arabic-speaking medical teams along with the soldiers.
  Hamas and Gazan health officials say the hospitals have served only as medical centers. But beyond accusing the Israeli military of planting evidence at hospitals, Hamas and Gazan officials have not directly refuted the evidence presented by Israel.
  The Israeli military said it apprehended dozens of ''terror operatives'' at Kamal Adwan Hospital in December, and released videos, at the time, of men carrying weapons. A spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza said that Israeli forces had asked the hospital's administrators to hand over the weapons of its security guards.
  After the raid on the Qatari Hospital, the commonly used name for the Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani Hospital for Rehabilitation and Prosthetics, the Israeli military showed a video on Nov. 5 of what it said was the entrance to ''a tunnel that was being used for terror infrastructures'' on the hospital's grounds.
  But the video appears to show something else: a water storage area built in 2016, when the hospital was constructed, according to engineering plans and images from the hospital's construction reviewed by The Times.
  The Israeli military declined to provide additional imagery to support its assertion that this was a tunnel entryway or part of a tunnel complex.
  Just before the Al-Shifa raid, Israeli forces entered Al-Rantisi hospital, on Nov. 13, soon after its remaining patients and staff had left. Within days, the military released two videos that showed weapons and explosives it said it found there, and a room where it said hostages had been kept. The health ministry in Gaza disputed the assertions made in the videos and said the weapons were planted.
  One of the videos released by Israel showed troops rushing into the hospital and appearing to find explosives, weapons and the hostage room. In the other, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, chief spokesman for the Israeli military, showed off guns, explosives and other weapons that he said were found in the basement of the hospital.
  The video included footage of a piece of paper taped to a wall in the hospital's basement. Admiral Hagari said the paper -- a grid with Arabic words and numbers within each square -- could be a schedule for guarding hostages ''where every terrorist writes his name.''
  The Gazan health ministry said it was nothing more than a work schedule. But the calendar begins on Oct. 7, the day of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, and an Arabic title written at the top uses the militants' name for the assault: ''Al Aqsa Flood Battle, 7/10/2023.''
  Given its size and history, taking control of Al-Shifa was always a more important goal for the Israeli military than the other smaller facilities.
  There is substantial independent evidence that Hamas constructed a vast tunnel network across Gaza. Senior Israeli defense officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, estimate the network is between 350 and 450 miles -- extraordinary figures for a territory that at its longest point is only 25 miles. The officials estimate there are thousands of entrances to the network.
  There is also established documentation that Hamas used Al-Shifa before the war to mask some of its activities. During Israel's three-week war with Hamas in 2008, armed Hamas fighters in civilian clothing were seen roaming Al-Shifa's corridors and killing an Israeli collaborator, according to a Times correspondent reporting in Gaza at the time. Six years later, during the next round of fighting, the militants routinely held news conferences at the hospital and used it as a safe meeting place for Hamas officials to speak with journalists.
  After that war, Amnesty International reported that Hamas had used abandoned areas of Al-Shifa, ''including the outpatients' clinic area, to detain, interrogate, torture and otherwise mistreat suspects, even as other parts of the hospital continued to function as a medical center.''
  Israel's critics, though, countered with statements made at the time by two Norwegian doctors, who described themselves as pro-Palestinian activists and had worked in Gaza during the 2014 war. They insisted that they saw no Hamas presence at Al-Shifa.
  Israel has also released video footage, taken by the hospital's own security cameras, which it says shows two hostages being brought to Al-Shifa shortly after being abducted in the Oct. 7 attack.
  The Al-Shifa tunnel was discovered by following ducts that ran underground from air-conditioning units that were powered by the hospital's electricity supply and mounted on one of its buildings, officials said. Israeli soldiers also found evidence that the hospital's water supply was being fed to the tunnel.
  The Israeli military has also displayed weapons and other equipment it said were found inside Al-Shifa, including grenades placed near an MRI machine. Among the cache presented to journalists were belongings that Israeli officials said had been taken from hostages, including a bag emblazoned with the name Be'eri, a kibbutz attacked by Hamas.
  The military also said it found weapons in Al-Shifa's parking lot, and a Toyota vehicle identical to those used in the Oct. 7 attack and loaded with the same equipment that militants carried during the raid, including guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Israeli officials speculated that it was a spare vehicle not used in the attack.
  Some of what the Israeli military has shown so far does not wholly match the description of a terrorist headquarters that it offered ahead of its ground invasion of Gaza on Oct. 27.
  Underneath Al-Shifa, the Israeli military wrote in a lengthy post on its website, ''lies a labyrinth of tunnels and underground compounds used by Hamas's leaders to direct terrorist activities and rocket fire and to manufacture and store a variety of weapons and ammunition.''
  There may no longer be a way to directly assess that claim. Israeli forces remained at Al-Shifa for a little more than a week.
  Hours before Israeli forces left the hospital on Nov. 24, soldiers lined the tunnel with explosives and destroyed it in a blast that sent plumes of smoke high into the air and rocked buildings on the ground above.Neil Collier contributed reporting.

Portraits of Gazans
A toddler, a 12-year-old, a mother, a photojournalist.
Their lives were ripped apart in one of the deadliest and most destructive wars of the 21st century.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, now in its fourth month, is often conveyed in stark numbers and historical comparisons: Some 27,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health ministry. Nearly two million are displaced and more than 60 percent of residential buildings have been damaged or destroyed.
Yet the lives behind those statistics are often hidden from view. Internet and cellphone services are frequently cut; international reporters cannot enter Gaza except on escorted trips with the Israeli military; and dozens of Palestinian journalists have been killed in a military campaign prompted by the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.
Samar Abu Elouf, a photojournalist for The New York Times, spent weeks following a handful of Palestinians who seemed to have lost everything: a boy with charred limbs, a journalist who lost four of his children in an Israeli strike, an orphaned toddler who may never walk again.
Then The Times evacuated Ms. Abu Elouf and her family in December as the Israeli ground offensive extended across southern Gaza.
Since then, Gaza has spiraled toward famine. Some residents say they are eating grass and animal feed to survive. Giant bombs fall near the last functioning hospitals. Torrential rains pound disease-ridden tent camps. Exhausted medics make harrowing choices.
Through it all, Ms. Abu Elouf has tried to stay in touch with the people she photographed, but some can no longer be reached.
Their stories, like that of Gaza itself, are still playing out.
The Orphan
At first, rescuers thought Melisya Joudeh was dead.
They pulled her inert body from the rubble of her family home, 10 hours after the building was crushed by a devastating strike on Oct. 22. At the hospital, she was put in a tent filled with corpses.
But an hour later, 16-month-old Melisya began to whimper and splutter. A clamor erupted and she was rushed into the hospital for emergency treatment, said Yasmine Joudeh, an exhausted aunt who was keeping a bedside vigil for the girl days later as she dozed in a pink bunny shirt.
She was one of just three survivors from what relatives and local journalists said was an Israeli airstrike.
Her mother, expecting twins, had gone into labor hours before the strike on their house and was pulled dead from the ruins still clutching her belly, Yasmine said. Melisya’s father and brother were also killed, as were her grandparents, five uncles, two aunts, their spouses and dozens of cousins, she said, in all about 60 people from the Jarousha and Joudeh families who had lived in that housing compound for decades.
Children account for about 40 percent of those killed in Gaza since Oct. 7, according to the Gaza authorities and international organizations. Melisya cheated death but instead joined the 19,000 children that the war has left with no parents or with no adults to look after them, according to UNICEF.
And she will be scarred for life. Weeks earlier, Melisya had taken her first steps, her aunt said. They were probably her last.
Bomb fragments severed her spinal cord and paralyzed her from the waist down, doctors said. But a few weeks after she was wounded, Melisya was discharged. Doctors said they lacked medicine to treat her and needed her bed for newer casualties.
Yasmine took Melisya home. She considered the orphan a blessing from God, but caring for her was still difficult.
Melisya screamed when her wounds were being washed. And at night, she woke from her sleep crying out “Mama!” or “Baba!”
The Mother
Oct. 7 began as a day of joy for Safaa Zyadah.
Just hours before midnight on the 6th, she had given birth to her fifth child — a girl she named Batool — at a hospital in Gaza City.
But as she cradled her newborn, the noises of war crashed into her ward.
Ms. Zyadah, 32, who had lived through several wars in Gaza, hoped this one might end quickly. But as she returned home later that day, it became clear this time was different.
The walls of her home trembled as Israeli warplanes roared overhead, dropping bombs in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack which Israel says killed about 1,200 people on Oct. 7. Ms. Zyadah and her husband gathered their five children, the eldest age 13, and began to run.
In the early weeks of the war, they changed houses several times, sheltering with relatives until fighting or Israeli warnings forced them to move on. As the family scurried through the streets, she said, they saw fighter jets firing on targets and spotted corpses strewed on the roadside.
They finally halted at a makeshift U.N.-run camp in the city of Khan Younis, in southern Gaza. It was crowded and dirty, but supposedly safe. Cramped into a tiny tent, her family began to organize their lives as best they could. A few days later, she cradled Batool as she spoke to The Times, grateful they had survived.
“We are tired of running,” she said. But their respite was short-lived.
In early December, Israeli troops entered Khan Younis, hoping to flush out the Hamas fighters they said were hiding among civilians. Fighting raged around the perimeter of the U.N. camp, which housed 43,000 people, sometimes piercing it.
On Jan. 24, several shells hit a U.N. shelter in the camp that housed about 800 people, killing 13, the United Nations said. The White House said it was “gravely concerned” by the episode.
It was unclear whether Ms. Zyadah and her family were affected. They could not be reached by phone recently.
The Photojournalist
Confronting the pain of others is central to the career of Mohammed al-Aloul, 36, a photojournalist who for years has framed Gaza’s strife in his viewfinder.
But on Nov. 5, the pain came for him.
It was etched on Mr. al-Aloul’s face as he clutched the swaddled remains of his son, killed in what Gaza authorities said was an Israeli airstrike. And that pain roared through him again that same day when he stood over the bodies of three of his other children who, it turned out, had died in the same attack.
Falling to his knees, he wept.
“God help me endure this pain,” he said.
After Oct. 7, he hardly saw his own family, dashing from the scene of one bombing to another, shooting video for the Turkish state-run media agency, Anadolu. But he missed his five children badly, he said.
Before the war, they would join him after work to watch soccer games on television at home, cheering and screaming “gooaal!” along with the commentators. Once fighting started, he wore his son Ahmed’s baseball cap to work.
“It carried his smell,” he said.
On Nov. 4, after spending a rare night at home, Mr. al-Aloul said his 6-year-old son, Kenan, had begged him not to go. But he left, and as he was documenting displaced families the following day, a friend called.
There had been a strike near his home in central Gaza. What followed was a frantic blur, Mr. al-Aloul said.
He scrolled through social media and called friends as fragments of news came through.
Finally, at the hospital, he learned that Kenan and three of his other children — Ahmad, 13, Rahaf, 11, and Qais, 4 — were dead, as were four of his brothers and some of their children and neighbors. His wife was seriously wounded.
The sole survivor among his children was his youngest son, 1-year-old Adam, whose face was lashed by shrapnel.
“He’s all I have left,” Mr. al-Aloul said days later, clutching the child to his chest.
Now, Mr. al-Aloul’s family is in Turkey, where his wife is undergoing treatment for her extensive wounds.
The Pregnant Woman
Wisal Abu Odeh, 34, fainted after standing in line for an hour to use a bathroom. Life was hard for everyone in the dirty, cramped camp for displaced people in Khan Younis. But she was five months pregnant.
“Sometimes,” she said in November, “I think it would have been better to die in my house.”
Before the war, Ms. Abu Odeh was thinking about decorating a Spider-Man-themed nursery for the baby boy she was expecting. After the fighting began, she worried about making it through her pregnancy alive.
Conditions are dire at the U.N. camps that house most of Gaza’s displaced people. Diarrhea, respiratory infections and hygiene-related conditions like lice are soaring, the United Nations says. Thousands of people often share a single shower or toilet.
Amid all of that chaos live about 50,000 pregnant women, and about 180 give birth each day, the U.N. estimates. Basic care is unavailable. Cesarean sections are sometimes performed without anaesthetic. Many women give birth in tents or toilets, according to Doctors Without Borders.
Ms. Abu Odeh said she was sleeping in a space with 14 other girls and women. Stricken by hunger and fear, they sometimes felt tensions explode. She had seen women punching or pulling hair in disputes over food or water — or jumping the line to go to the bathroom.
Lately, the fighting reached her camp and she could not be reached by phone.
A Child Burn Victim
Mohamed Abu Rteinah, 12, doesn’t remember much of what happened when a blast crushed his home on Oct. 24. One minute, he was having tea for breakfast as his grandmother read the Quran. The next minute, he was running and screaming, his limbs seemingly on fire, he said.
His mother, Ula Faraj, 33, said she recoiled in horror when she first saw the burns that cover about 30 percent of his legs. His 8-year-old sister, Batool, had similar injuries.
It was unclear who fired the munition that struck their home in the southern city of Rafah, although Gaza authorities and The Associated Press reported Israeli airstrikes in the area at the time. Many of the tens of thousands of bombs dropped by Israel since Oct. 7 were supplied by the United States, including 2,000-pound “bunker busters” that have killed hundreds in densely populated areas.
Human rights groups say those weapons could implicate American officials in war crimes. Israel says it respects the laws of war and takes precautions to limit civilian casualties in its war against Hamas. President Biden, who once warned Israel it was losing support for its “indiscriminate bombing,” says he is urging Israeli forces to minimize those casualties.
Veteran doctors say the extent of pediatric burns in Gaza is distressing, especially when the territory’s collapsed health system can barely treat them. Only basic painkillers were available to treat Mohamed and Batool, their mother said at a hospital in Khan Younis. Gauze, ointment and clean water were in short supply.
She could barely watch, she said, as her children wept when doctors tried to clean their wounds.
Weeks later, the family managed to leave Gaza for emergency surgery in Cairo — and on Wednesday, they were evacuated to the United Arab Emirates with other wounded children from Gaza for further treatment.

Israel says Hamas routinely operates within — and beneath — places like Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, using them as shields, and has held Israeli hostages there. The group denies the charges.
The Israeli military on Thursday raided the largest hospital still functioning in the Gaza Strip, in what it called a search for Hamas fighters and the bodies of hostages. Many people who had sought shelter there were forced to flee from combat once again. 
Explosions and gunfire rocked the hospital in the city of Khan Younis, the Nasser Medical Complex, before the predawn raid, killing and wounding several people including at least one doctor and a patient, according to a doctor there, as well as the charity Doctors Without Borders, which had staff members at the hospital, and Gaza health authorities. The specific casualty claims, like many assertions in the conflict, could not be immediately confirmed.
Videos posted on social media on Thursday and voice messages sent by doctors during the night, both before and after Israeli forces smashed through the perimeter wall and entered the compound, depicted scenes of chaos and fear inside the damaged, smoke-filled hospital, punctuated by automatic gunfire, explosions and shouting.
One video, verified by The New York Times, showed damage to the hospital and injured people being rushed through a smoke-filled corridor among debris amid sounds of gunfire. Witnesses said people by the hundreds — possibly thousands — later stood in long lines as Israeli troops screened them, a few at a time, for evacuation.
The Israeli military said it had detained dozens of people, but did not say who or why.
“We have credible intelligence from a number of sources, including from released hostages, indicating that Hamas held hostages at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, and that there may be bodies of our hostages in the Nasser hospital facility,” Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, said in a video statement.
The military did not say whether hostages or Hamas fighters had been found. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza, said that Israeli forces had used bulldozers to dig up graves on the hospital grounds.
For two days before the raid, Israeli forces surrounding the medical center had told displaced people over loudspeakers to evacuate, signaling that a raid was coming, though international rights and medical groups warned of dire consequences. Some of the Palestinians who took refuge there did leave, but others said it was too dangerous — some had tried and said that gunfire and airstrikes had forced them to turn back.
Doctors and health officials said that some people who tried to flee on Tuesday were killed. Asked for comment, the Israeli military did not respond to specific allegations about people coming under fire.
“We really don’t know what to do,” a local journalist, Mohammed Salama, said in a video posted on Wednesday to social media. In the background, people lined up with sacks of belongings to leave the hospital, but he said people who tried to evacuate were forced to stand at checkpoint lines for hours.
The Israeli military said Thursday that it had opened a “humanitarian corridor” for people leaving the hospital, but even then witnesses who fled said it was a harrowing and perilous experience.
Gazan officials said that about 300 medical workers, 450 wounded patients and 8,000 people displaced from their homes elsewhere in the territory were on the hospital grounds when the week began. It was unclear how many were still there by Thursday morning.
While trying to crush Hamas in Gaza, Israel also faces a conflict with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group based in Lebanon, which has stepped up its rocket fire on Israel in solidarity with Hamas. The two sides have traded dozens of attacks across Israel’s northern border since October, and both have threatened further escalation. U.S. officials have counseled calm, trying to avoid the opening of a full-fledged second front in the war.
Israeli forces carried out multiple airstrikes in Lebanon on Thursday, a day after a series of strikes that Lebanese state media said had killed 10 civilians, and that Hezbollah said had killed several of its fighters.
The raid on Nasser hospital was “a precise and limited operation,” conducted by “special forces who underwent special training for this mission,” Admiral Hagari said. Israeli forces had not told patients or medical staff to leave, he added, saying that Israel in fact wanted the hospital to continue functioning.
But by multiple accounts, most of the medical workers and patients did evacuate. Mr. Salama said that Israeli troops were telling doctors to leave, though not by the same route as others. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement, “our medical staff have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind,” and that “one of our colleagues was detained” by the Israelis.
Dr. Islam Sawaly, a doctor at Nasser, said she and a group of others left the hospital around 3 a.m. and walked for more than four hours along a dark road pocked with potholes. “We fell into sewage ditches,” she said. Finally, they reached the area of Miraj, between Khan Younis and Rafah, the city along the border with Egypt where more than a million Gazans have sought refuge.
Doctors Without Borders said only the sickest patients had stayed behind at Nasser, though the number was unclear. In voice memos shared by the group, a doctor at the hospital, whose name it withheld for his safety, said Israeli troops had ordered all remaining staff and patients into one building, the oldest in the complex, and that only about 40 employees were left.
Before the raid began, a rocket struck the hospital at about 2 a.m., killing a patient in his bed and injuring six others, the doctor said in the voice message. Dr. Sawaly said another rocket strike had killed a doctor and left two other people with burns, though Gazan health officials said the doctor was injured but not killed.
Hospitals have been a flashpoint throughout the war that began with the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, of whom more than 130 are still thought to be held in Gaza. Talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar, on a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages, are underway this week in Cairo, but the two sides appear to be far apart.
Israel has faced widespread international condemnation for its conduct in the war, which has killed more than 28,000 people in Gaza, the health authorities there say, and destroyed much of the enclave’s infrastructure. Much of that criticism has focused on attacks on hospitals, mosques and schools, which are supposed to be protected under the laws of war.
Israel has long accused Hamas, which had governed Gaza since 2007, of using such places as de facto military bases and the civilians there as human shields — itself a violation of international law — wagering that they are less likely to be targeted directly. In some cases, the Israelis contend, beneath those facilities are important nodes in Hamas’s vast tunnel network. Hamas and hospital administrators deny the claims.
Most of Gaza’s hospitals have stopped operating as hospitals. Those that still do are overcrowded, many have been damaged, and they lack critical supplies. Israel says it has ensured the delivery of needed supplies to Nasser; the United Nations says Israel has blocked such deliveries.
Israel has repeatedly ordered civilian evacuations, beginning in northern Gaza and working its way southward, displacing many people multiple times and steadily forcing them into more crowded spaces. Palestinians and aid groups say that amid falling bombs, street battles and scarce supplies, there is no safe place in Gaza.
Khan Younis, one of the major cities of southern Gaza, has been the focus of ground combat for weeks, and Israeli officials describe it as a Hamas stronghold.
More than half of Gaza’s roughly 2.3 million people have sought refuge in Rafah, many of them sleeping in makeshift shelters and tents. Israeli officials have said the military will eventually enter Rafah in force, as well.

Body


Here is an updated collection of New York Times articles, essays, podcasts and videos to help students learn about the war, media literacy, dueling historical narratives and more.
In the week after Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7, we published an extensive teaching resource and a forum for students to help classrooms learn more about the conflict. Nearly four months later, with the subsequent Israeli bombardment and ground war that have killed thousands of civilians in Gaza, we know that schools are still wrestling with how — and whether — to talk to their students about the Israel-Hamas war.
When we asked teachers if they were addressing the war in their classrooms, Evan Britton, a high school history and religion teacher in Oregon, told us, “Even if it’s uncomfortable, we have to discuss this in our classrooms, because that may be the only place a kid gets accurate and reliable information.” Mike J., a middle school history teacher in Washington, said that he wanted his students “to be comfortable asking questions, seeking truth and processing their feelings with those they trust.”
But teachers also told us how difficult this particular subject was to broach with students. Wynne Boliek, a high school A.P. history teacher in South Carolina, said, “I am always careful with topics like these, but this time I have been extra careful,” since emotions are running so high. Barbara Sarbin, a middle school civics teacher in Hawaii, shared that “so many students encounter news on social media (TikTok or Instagram) and don’t understand what they are seeing.”
We hope that this updated teaching resource, with new articles, videos and Opinion essays from The Times, can help. We organized the collection below into seven sections, covering almost four months of war, dueling historical narratives, international responses, media literacy, peace proposals and more. Each section includes a summary with links to selected Times resources, along with critical thinking questions to help students engage with some of the most important issues.
Getting Started
The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians can stir up powerful emotions, so we recommend considering advice from the nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves, such as “know your students” and “create a reflective classroom community.” You might also review these tips and tools from Solutions Not Sides, a nonpartisan organization that offers “a critical approach to education on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” to help students avoid antisemitic and Islamophobic language and stereotypes.
Before asking students to explore The Times’s extensive coverage of the conflict in this collection, it is important to get a sense of what they are thinking and feeling. Try starting with these journal prompts:
What have you read, seen or heard about what is going on in Israel and Gaza? What emotions, feelings and thoughts are you experiencing?
What kinds of conversations have you had with friends and family members on this subject?
Where are you getting your information? How do you know that what you are seeing and hearing is accurate?
How comfortable are you in sharing your questions and opinions about the conflict?
What questions do you have about what is happening now and about the larger context?
I. The War
On Oct. 7, Hamas, the Islamic group that controls the Gaza Strip, mounted a highly coordinated invasion of Israel, with terrorists attacking towns and killing people in their homes and on the streets. More than 1,200 Israelis died, including more than 100 young revelers who were dancing at an outdoor rave. Over 240 Israelis were taken hostage by Hamas. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating reports that the attackers committed widespread sexual violence.
In response, Israel launched in Gaza one of the most intense military campaigns in modern history. So far, Israel’s forces have killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, a majority of them women and children, according to Gaza health officials, and displaced more than 80 percent of the enclave’s surviving population, according to the United Nations. The U.N. has also warned that half the population of about 2.2 million is at risk of starvation.
In late November, Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary cease-fire, in a deal that allowed for the release of more than 100 hostages by Hamas and more than 200 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. It also allowed for the delivery of more aid to Gaza’s civilians. However, after several days the truce collapsed and fighting quickly resumed.
A recent string of attacks across the Middle East, from Yemen to Pakistan, has raised concerns that the war between Hamas and Israel is spreading, and might put pressure on other countries like Iran and the United States to get more involved.
To understand further what has happened since Oct. 7, students could start by exploring one or more of the following resources.
For a visual of the ongoing fighting …
Look at a map of the Middle East (zoom in to see where Israel and Gaza are).
View maps tracking the attacks in Israel and Gaza.
Scroll through photos of the war (this gallery contains graphic images).
For an explainer of the Oct. 7 attack …
For more on the Oct. 7 attack, listen to the opening of “The Daily” episode “War in Israel.” Students can then read the explainer “What We Know About the Hamas Attack and Israel’s Response” to get a basic understanding of how the fighting began.
For a look into the Israeli siege on Gaza in the months since …
Students might listen to another episode of “The Daily,” “The New State of the War in Gaza,” or read “A Glimpse Inside a Devastated Gaza"" to comprehend the destruction the war has wreaked.
For updates …
The Times is continuously reporting on the war. Students can keep up with the live updates here and on The Times’s short morning podcast, “The Headlines.”
Questions for writing and discussion
After exploring these resources, have students discuss or write in response to the following prompts:
What did you learn about the Israel-Hamas war? Share at least three details that stand out to you.
What emotions, feelings and thoughts did you experience while learning about what is happening in the region?
What aspects of the war do you find confusing or unclear? What questions do you have about the conflict?
II. A Contested History
The relentless, deadly conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has persisted for decades. Many teachers who responded to our call-out said that the most important thing they would like to help their students understand was the history and context of the present war. That history, however, is highly contested: The Times correspondent Roger Cohen, reporting from Israel, says: “There are two stories. There are two narratives. There are two versions of events.”
As Ezra Klein, the host of The Times’s “The Ezra Klein Show” podcast, explained in a two-part series that explored Israeli and Palestinian perspectives:
Before there can be any kind of stable coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians, there will have to be a stable coexistence of narratives. And that’s what we’ll be attempting this week on the show: to look at both the present and the past through Israeli and Palestinian perspectives. The point is not to choose between them. The point is to really listen to them. Even — especially — when what’s being said is hard for us to hear.
The following resources can help students more deeply understand how each side’s beliefs and experiences have shaped the conflict today.
For a broad overview of the conflict in this region …
Go to our first lesson (Section IV. How We Got Here), which includes resources from a variety of sources that summarize the decades of conflict.
For a deep dive into the events of 1948 …
Listen to “1948” (44 min.), an episode from “The Daily” podcast, or read “The Road to 1948,” an edited version of a panel discussion hosted by the Times Magazine. For Israelis, 1948 marks the birth of the modern state of Israel, when Israeli Jews fought a war of independence after neighboring Arab nations attacked. For Palestinians, 1948 marks the nakba (catastrophe), when more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes and resettled in refugee camps, many of which are in Gaza. The podcast episode and Magazine article explore how the events of that fateful year shaped the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades to come.
For a deeper understanding of Palestinian and Israeli perspectives on this history …
Read two guest essays. In “This War Did Not Start a Month Ago,” Dalia Hatuqa, an independent journalist writing from Ramallah, West Bank, explains, “For Palestinians, systematic violence is nothing new. It dates back to the nakba.” In “Why Jews Cannot Stop Shaking Right Now,” Dara Horn writes about how the reverberations of past massacres are shaping the reaction of Jews to Hamas’s attacks on Israel.
Or, listen to two episodes of “The Ezra Klein Show.” In a two-part series, Mr. Klein talks to a Palestinian policy analyst and an Israeli writer about how each sees the current conflict in relation to history.
For more historical background and context of the conflict …
Read “A Quick Look at Hamas” or listen to “Hamas’s Bloody Arithmetic” to learn more about Hamas. The governing power in the Gaza Strip since 2007, Hamas seeks the creation of a Palestinian state based on Islamic fundamentalism and that includes all of historic Palestine, including Israel.
Listen to “Israel’s Plan to Destroy Hamas” or read “As War Enters 100th Day, Netanyahu Vows to Keep Fighting in Gaza” to learn more about Israel’s military response. Israel states that its military goal is to eliminate Hamas and to free the hostages; the government accuses Hamas of using Palestinian civilians as human shields (by building tunnels and command centers in and under schools, hospitals and civilian residences).
Listen to “The Best Primer I’ve Heard on Israeli-Palestinian Peace Efforts” or read “Was Peace Ever Possible?” to learn more about past peace efforts, such as the 1993 Oslo Accords, and why those efforts failed.
Read “Is Anti-Zionism Always Antisemitic? A Fraught Question for the Moment,” “What Is ‘Settler Colonialism’?” and “What Does ‘From the River to the Sea’ Mean?” to learn more about some of the language used by activists and allies on both sides of the conflict.
Questions for writing and discussion
Once students have explored the above resources, they can respond to the following prompts, in writing or through discussion with a partner:
How do the events of Oct. 7 and the war that has followed elicit painful memories of the past for both Israelis and Palestinians?
What can 1948, along with the events from the past century and a half, teach us about the present conflict? What details are most relevant to today?
Why do Israelis and Palestinians each see themselves as victims of the past? Can both be true?
What questions do you still have about this complex and fraught history?
III. First-Person Perspectives
How are civilians in Israel and Gaza experiencing this crisis? How are Jews and Arabs around the world living through this painful time? First-person accounts can provide essential perspectives behind the headlines, statistics and oft-disputed facts. In the following articles, videos and podcasts, students can hear directly from Israelis and Palestinians, and Jewish and Arab voices, from the war zone and across the globe.
To hear from those living in the conflict zone …
Watch “War Through the Eyes of Gaza’s Children” (3 min.), a video of a U.N. camp in southern Gaza.
Watch “‘You Carry Your Home With You’: A Palestinian Poet’s Journey Out of Gaza” (5 min.), the story of a man and his family who fled to Egypt amid the violence.
Listen to “‘The Daily’: The Doctors of Gaza” (32 min.) for stories of survival from doctors working inside the Gaza Strip.
Watch “They Believed in Peace. Hamas Stole Their Empathy.” (4 min.), a video from Opinion filmed in the days after the Oct. 7 attack; survivors reflect on what they lost, whom they blame and what’s next — for them and for Israel.
Watch “‘No End in Sight’: Evacuated Israeli City Braces for Possible War With Hezbollah” (4 min.), about Israeli residents who have been evacuated from border regions.
Listen to “‘The Daily’: Golan’s Story” (32 min.), a podcast episode about a father’s account of survival in the Oct. 7 attack on an Israeli kibbutz.
Read “Palestinian and Israeli Teens Swam in the Same Pool. Then Came Oct. 7,” about how the war in Gaza has tested teenagers who have been teammates for years.
Read “At These Schools, Arab and Jewish Students Share Their Feelings, With Each Other,” to learn about how children at schools dedicated to the proposition that Israelis and Palestinians can learn and live together in peace are talking about the war.
To hear from members of the diaspora …
Read “We Will Never Forget Palestine” for accounts from those living in Jordan, home to the world’s largest Palestinian diaspora.
Read “‘I Was Very Alone Today’: Young Jewish Americans Grieve Over Israel,” in which those in their teens and 20s talk about how they felt in the aftermath of the Hamas attack.
Read “In a Place Called Little Palestine, People Feel Afraid. And Forgotten,” about how one community in New Jersey is dealing with the war and an increase in Islamophobia.
Read “Jewish American Families Confront a Generational Divide Over Israel,” about how younger American Jews often see Israel as an occupying power oppressing Palestinians; such a view is shocking to their parents and grandparents, who tend to see Israel as an essential haven fighting for survival.
Read “Israeli and Palestinian Activists Ask Americans to Take Side of Peace,” to hear from two activists sharing their lived experiences and working for peace.
Questions for writing and discussion
Then invite students to respond to the following prompts, in writing or through discussion with a partner:
How did the perspectives of ordinary Israelis and Palestinians affect your understanding of the crisis? How do they deepen or complicate what you already knew about the situation in the Middle East? What quotes and details stood out, and why?
What does watching, hearing or reading these stories make you think and feel? What questions would you like to ask the people featured or profiled in the pieces?
What new questions about the conflict and war arose? What firsthand voices and perspectives would you like to hear more?
IV. Protest and Society
The Israel-Hamas war has sparked protests, marches and vigils across the globe. In the United States, the war has roiled college campuses and K-12 schools. It has pitted individuals and communities against each other amid demands to “pick a side.”
To help your students explore the emotionally charged responses to what is happening in Israel and Gaza, they might read, watch or listen to some of the following resources.
To learn about demonstrations around the world …
Watch a video of a march in Londonor view photos of demonstrations across the United States by those who have rallied in solidarity with Palestinians, condemning the high rate of civilian casualties and calling for a cease-fire and lift of the siege in Gaza.
Read about Jewish groups in places like the United States and France calling for the release of hostages taken by Hamas and condemning the surge in antisemitism since the attack.
To learn about the debate on college campuses …
Look at a timeline of how the war has roiled college campuses.
Listen to “‘The Daily’: “Antisemitism and Free Speech Collide on College Campuses” (32 min.) or read “After Antisemitic Attacks, Colleges Debate What Kind of Speech Is Out of Bounds” for a peek into what college campuses are like now.
Read takes on what “free speech” means at universities in the U.S.  amid the current conflict: “The Backlash to Anti-Israel Protests Threatens Free Speech,” by Michelle Goldberg, an Opinion columnist, and “What Is Happening on College Campuses Is Not Free Speech,” by three college students.
To learn about the response from K-12 schools …
Read “Public Schools Struggle to Say the Right Thing About the Israel-Hamas War,” describing the backlash schools have faced as they try to respond to the crisis, or “New York City Schools Will Teach About Antisemitism and Islamophobia,” on New York’s approach.
To help students think about their own roles in talking about this conflict …
Watch “‘Pick a Side. Pick a Side. Pick a Side. Now.’” (4 min.), a video from Opinion exploring the role of social media and whether it allows any space for nuance or neutrality during the war.
Read the article “On Social Media, People Face Pressure to Speak Out About the War” or the guest essay “I Don’t Have to Post About My Outrage. Neither Do You.” Students can respond on our related forum.
Questions for writing and discussion
Then invite students to respond to the following prompts, in writing or through discussion with a partner:
Have there been discussions, debates, demonstrations or protests about the conflict in your community?
What is your reaction to protests on college campuses and K-12 schools? What role, if any, do you think educational institutions should have when it comes to this war?
How comfortable are you about learning more and sharing your own opinions about the conflict? Have you felt pressured to post your reaction online, to express outrage or sympathy, to take a stance or a side?
V. The World’s Response
Since Oct. 7, global attention has turned to the war in Gaza, and now there are growing fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East.
To learn about U. S. policy …  
In a televised address on Oct. 10, President Biden forcefully condemned Hamas’s actions as “pure, unadulterated evil” and vowed unequivocally to stand with Israel against terrorism. Since then, the United States has guarded Israel’s interests at the United Nations and provided the country with munitions. Yet Mr. Biden faces growing internal resistance to his backing of Israel, and Congressional Democrats have been pressing him to curb Israel’s assault. Read “The U.S. and Israel: An Embrace Shows Signs of Strain After Oct. 7” to learn more.
To learn more about the rest of the world …
Much of the world has lost patience with Israel’s war in Gaza, where a humanitarian crisis grows worse daily. The United States finds itself diplomatically isolated and at odds with staunch allies like France, Canada, Australia and Japan, all of which voted last month for a resolution calling for a cease-fire (the resolution failed to pass on account of a U.S. veto). The United Nations’ secretary general, António Guterres, declared in January that Israel’s military operation in Gaza has led to destruction and killing on a scale that is “utterly unacceptable.”
To learn about the charge of genocide …
After months besieging and bombarding the Gaza Strip in its war against Hamas, Israel now faces a charge of genocide. Earlier this month at the International Court of Justice, South Africa argued that Israel “means to create conditions of death” in Gaza, and demanded that the court order an emergency suspension of the military campaign. Israel categorically denied the genocide accusation.
To many Israelis, the case is the culmination of a decades-long effort to turn Israel into a pariah by holding the country — which was founded in the aftermath of a genocide of Jews — to a far higher level of scrutiny than other nations. By contrast, many Palestinians feel a brief sense of catharsis at the thought of Israeli officials being compelled to defend their country in front of a panel of international judges. Two Opinion pieces, by the columnist Bret Stephens and by the Los Angeles Times correspondent Megan K. Stack, capture opposing viewpoints on the genocide charge.
To learn more about the widening crisis …
Fears of a wider war are growing with a string of attacks across the Middle East. The Iran-backed Houthi militia has intensified attacks on commercial vessels and warships in the Red Sea, saying it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas. In response, the United States has struck more than a dozen sites in Yemen. Also in January, Iran fired missiles toward Iraq, Syria and Pakistan; Pakistan responded by striking Iranian territory. Turkey hit Kurdish targets in northern Iraq and Syria; in addition to pounding southern Gaza, Israel struck southern Lebanon, from which Hezbollah militants have fired rockets toward Israel.
Questions for writing and discussion
What role, if any, do you think the United States, other countries and the U.N. should play in the conflict?
How well do you think the Biden administration has handled the crisis in the Middle East? What approach do you think he should take with Israel?
Does South Africa’s charge accusing Israel of genocide have merit? Or, is the charge a “moral obscenity,” as Mr. Stephens argues?
How concerned should we be about a widening war in the Middle East?
VI. Media and Media Literacy
Covering wars is always fraught, both because journalists on the ground are often in harm’s way and because the sides at war aggressively push information in their favor. As Jonathan Levy, the executive editor of Sky News, said, “In every war, there is a war of narratives.”
The war between Israel and Hamas has proved even more difficult than most conflicts because it has generated vast amounts of misleading and false information online.
To help students understand the role of journalism and social media in this conflict and to make sense of what is online, these resources can help.
To help sort fact from fiction …
How do students know what they see online is factual and accurate? Read “The Horrifying Images Are Real. But They’re Not From the Israel-Gaza War,” about how videos and photos from unrelated tragedies are being misused to represent this war, a cycle that experts say diminishes the experiences of victims past and present.
In “A.I. Muddies Israel-Hamas War in Unexpected Way,” students might consider how the mere possibility that A.I. content could be circulating is leading people to dismiss genuine images, video and audio as inauthentic.
This Opinion pieceby the columnist Michelle Goldberg explains how social media and a frantically churning news cycle make it “impossible to know what to believe in this hideous war.”
To learn about how The Times is covering the war …
This quick explainercan help students understand how reporting on this conflict happens and why it is so difficult.
An editor’s note in October by The Times after it reported on a bombing at a Gaza City hospital offers a lesson on sourcing, prominence in the news report and corrections.
To consider the role of imagery …
Young people especially may be consuming news about this war primarily through images. “When Everyone Becomes a War Photographer” and “The War in Gaza Is Also Unfolding on Instagram” explore how those images “don’t just document the story — they shape it.”
To learn about the process of choosing what images to include in the report, read “Harsh Visuals of War Leave Newsrooms Facing Tough Choices.”
Questions for writing and discussion
First, you might introduce students to various tools for consuming media critically, such as the SIFT method (see Section V. Media Literacy in our original lesson for more). Then have them discuss the following questions as a class:
How closely have you been following the news about Israel and Gaza? Where are you getting your information? How much of your understanding is from social media?
How do you know that what you are seeing and hearing is accurate? How do you go about determining whether a source is reliable before you share it on social media?
How do you know when something you are seeing is biased? What kind of language do you look for? Can you share examples of what you think is biased or unbiased coverage?
How can images and language shape what we believe? What can help us sort fact from fiction and propaganda on emotionally charged issues like this one?
Which voices or perspectives have been most represented in the news media that you have seen or read? Which have been missing?
In this particular conflict, why might we need to be especially careful about the media we consume?
VII. What’s Next? What Solution Could There Be?
There is no easy path forward or consensus on what should be done after the fighting ends.
Israel and Hamas continue indirect talks on a cease-fire, but the gap between the sides remains wide, especially on two issues: the fate of Hamas leaders in Gaza and the length of any pause in fighting.
The Times Opinion section reached out to thinkers, political leaders and experts to present their visions on how to achieve lasting peace in the region. Here are three excerpts from the collection of 10 essays:
In “The Answer Lies With Biden,” Bernard Avishai and Ezzedine Fishere argue that the United States needs to use its power and prestige to push for a two-state solution:
Mr. Biden enjoys great moral prestige in an Israel deeply skeptical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He also has credibility with Arab leaders and can make a good-faith overture to the Palestinian street because, in spite of anti-American sentiment, all understand that the United States is the only power Israel depends on and that America has more leverage than ever to induce productive negotiations. A strong U.S. commitment to two states — one that entails a demand for a settlement freeze — would almost certainly force the dissolution of Mr. Netanyahu’s government, since it rests on the support of religious parties that represent the settler movement. Rejecting American diplomatic leadership in favor of continued settlements would probably lead to the withdrawal of centrists from his unity cabinet.
In “Build a Culture of Peace,” Sulaiman Khatib and Avner Wishnitzer, co-founders of Combatants for Peace, write:
Peacemaking must be enveloped in a comprehensive project of rehumanization: a widespread process to reverse the effects of oppression, violence and dehumanization of the other, which have been fueling one another for decades.
It continues:
This common ground must be premised on the mutual affirmation that both peoples have a past and a future in this land and that none of them should be subject to the violence or oppression of the other. Rehumanization is, in other words, a project of liberation.
In “Let Palestinians Decide,” Diana Buttu, a lawyer and former adviser to P.L.O. negotiators, writes:
The future of Gaza — like that of the West Bank — is for Palestinians to decide. That is the essence of self-determination. The international community must not continue to place Israel first, as has been done for decades. It cannot try to seek convenient leaders as partners or try to enter yet another long-term arrangement.
Palestinians must live freely, without the faintest sense of an Israeli noose around our necks. Whatever immediate arrangements are put in place after Israel’s assault on Gaza ends must be coupled with an end to Israel’s regime of oppression and be accompanied by measures to hold Israel to account for any war crimes it has committed. Any solution that does not include this will fail.
In a word, Palestinians demand one thing: freedom.
Questions for Writing and Discussion
Share these excerpts with students and then invite them to choose one or more essays to respond to, either by writing a letter back to the author or by selecting three quotes that made an impression and explaining why. Some things to consider:
What did you learn from these voices and perspectives? How do they help you to better understand and imagine paths forward toward peace and justice?
Which of their words do you most hope leaders in Israel, Gaza and around the world heed in the days and months ahead?
What questions do you still have about possible resolutions to the war and the decades-long conflict between Palestinians and Israelis?

Navigating Israel’s War When One Spouse Is Jewish, and One Is Not.

For some couples, figuring out how to talk about the war in Gaza is a hurdle in the relationship, but ultimately one that has brought them closer.
When Ava Friedmann and Michael Henein were married, they used a tablecloth from Ms. Friedmann’s grandmother as a huppah, or ritual canopy held above the couple in a Jewish wedding. Mr. Henein’s father, who is a Coptic Christian from Egypt, anointed them with holy oil.
That same braiding of their cultural traditions has steered them over the last three months, as they have talked about the Israel-Hamas war. Both were horrified by the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, but Mr. Henein worried instinctively about the Palestinian lives in Gaza that would be lost because of Israel’s military response. They decided to read identical news sources about the war to help make sure they stayed on the same page.
“We needed to really hear each other and share our perspectives, and make sure we were creating an environment that didn’t lead to conflict between the two of us,” Ms. Friedmann said.
Many American Jews have reconsidered how they feel about Israel and even their own Jewish identity since the Oct. 7 attack, in which Israeli officials say Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 people. Israel’s reprisal, a bombing campaign and invasion, has killed more than 26,000 people, Palestinian officials say.
For Jews in interfaith couples, no matter what they believe about Israel, there is the added dimension of communicating with a partner who may not viscerally feel a connection to Israel or other Jews. Their non-Jewish partners sometimes have entirely different feelings about the war and Israel, and even the most supportive spouses might struggle to understand their Jewish partners’ emotions.
Jewish intermarriage rates have risen in the United States. For decades, the trend has induced anxiety among Jewish leaders in America who fret that it threatens the perpetuation of the Jewish people. A Pew Research study published in 2021 showed that in the United States, roughly 40 percent of Jews who wed between 1980 and 1999 married non-Jewish partners. That number jumped to 61 percent between 2010 and 2020.
Those couples are in a unique position. Some partners among more than a dozen interfaith couples interviewed described navigating new challenges around raising children and emotional distance in their relationships. Others said the topic of the war had presented a hurdle, but ultimately brought them closer.
Jamie Smith, 48, who lives in Washington, D.C., has noticed how differently she and her husband, raised by Lutheran parents, think about antisemitic threats since the war began.
Worried about her four children’s safety, Ms. Smith, who is Jewish, encouraged her teenage son to cut his curly hair short so he would look less Jewish. (He declined.) And she wore a cross when she traveled with her children to Morocco and Turkey in December and early January. 
“I definitely feel an acute and heightened sense of danger of what it means to be Jewish right now,” she said. “I have talked to my husband about that and I don’t think he gets it.” Her husband declined to comment.
“Marriage can be hard enough,” she added. “When you also add a difference in religion, that adds another level of difficulty. I hadn’t experienced that until now.”
Some couples described a renewed sense of confidence and closeness in their relationships, as Jewish people leaned on non-Jewish partners for support, and both took leaps to try to view the conflict through the other’s eyes.
“There’s an opportunity here to connect and deepen the relationship by having meaningful conversations,” said Denise Handlarski, a rabbi who counsels many intermarried couples and also wrote the book “The A-Z of Intermarriage.” “You can see your partner’s pain or desire to be understood and try to be a support.”
In Chicago, Ms. Friedmann, 36, and Mr. Henein, 33, began discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the complications of intermarriage long before Oct. 7. Ms. Friedmann had many moments since they started dating when she turned to Mr. Henein and asked: “How do you feel about marrying someone Jewish?” Their relatives had mixed feelings about the relationship at the start.
When the war began, they found themselves grateful that they were so accustomed to having these frank conversations.
“Everything is out in the open with us,” Mr. Henein said, “which has definitely helped us navigate not only the wedding and the marriage ceremony, but also these attacks and our cultural differences.”
One obstacle, some Jewish partners in interfaith couples said, is trying to communicate the importance of Israel and solidarity among Jews.
Before she met her future husband, Lindsay Schwartz, 34, had little contact with Judaism, growing up in a Methodist household in eastern Georgia. But she understood early in their relationship how important connection to faith was to Jake Schwartz, 35, whose grandparents were Holocaust survivors.
“It was something you read in a book,” Ms. Schwartz said. “You hear about it, but I never in my life thought I would be — I’m going to have children that are a direct lineage of people who survived the atrocities.”
The Schwartzes, who live in Atlanta, visited Israel in March on a trip sponsored by Honeymoon Israel, a group that specializes in tours of the country for interfaith couples.
Since Oct. 7, the Schwartzes have been in lock step, they said, in mourning Israeli victims and supporting the country’s right to defend itself. Ms. Schwartz said she was considering Jewish day school for their future children because, she said, she and Jake had been shocked by what they saw as a lack of interest in the attack on Israel, and in antisemitism.
Kevan Link, 36, understood early in his relationship with Mindy Isser that pro-Palestinian activism would be part of their life together. Ms. Isser, 33, is a labor organizer who is Jewish and involved with the anti-Zionist group Jewish Voice for Peace.
Mr. Link, who was raised Catholic, also understood that not raising their children Jewish would be “a deal breaker” for his wife.
They have hosted Passover Seders, celebrate Shabbat most Friday nights and are raising their toddler, whose first birthday fell on Oct. 7, in the faith. Mr. Link sees his role as supportive sidekick, whether it is solo-parenting when Ms. Isser was arrested at a protest in favor of a cease-fire or stepping back when members of Ms. Isser’s family speak favorably of Israel.
Mr. Link said he had not fully understood what it meant to be both a member of the Jewish community and sharply critical of Israel until recently. In December, he attended a memorial service for Ms. Isser’s father at her childhood Conservative congregation, where enthusiastic support for Israel, manifested in prayers for the country and its army, was at odds with their beliefs.
Mr. Link said he was surprised to see a young girl at the synagogue wearing a hoodie in support of Israel’s military.
“I’ve told him so much how the Israel stuff is so intense and so much a part of Judaism, at least Conservative Judaism,” Ms. Isser said of her husband, adding, “he didn’t really get it until he saw it.”
For other couples, the war has raised new questions about the prospect of raising children in multifaith households.
Max Freedman, 35, and Morgan McGuire, 38, were married in October in Brooklyn.
Mr. Freedman had felt alienated from the traditionally pro-Israel Jewish community since before the war began, but during the war that feeling was amplified. He realized that he sympathized more with the priest at Ms. McGuire’s church, who expressed concern for the death toll in Gaza, than he did with some of the rabbis he knows.
He now wonders what it will look like to steer future children through the complexities of Jewish identity.
“Because we’re in this multifaith relationship, it’s up to me to bring the Judaism,” Mr. Freedman said. “It’s hard for me to be enthusiastic about that right now.”
Libby Shani, 42, and her partner, Lindsay Shani, 40, who was raised Catholic, were scheduled to go on a Honeymoon Israel trip in November, but it was postponed because of the war. Instead, Libby, who was born in Tel Aviv and moved to the United States when she was a toddler, visited Israel in January on a trip sponsored by the Jewish National Fund, a pro-Israel nonprofit.
What was supposed to be a shared experience ended up being a solo journey; Lindsay worried about safety, and didn’t share Libby’s feeling that this was an urgent moment to volunteer for Israeli society.
But Libby said she had also felt closer to Lindsay in recent months, because of the efforts Lindsay had made to support her, like reading books about Israel.
“There’s a level of rawness and openness that we hadn’t experienced yet,” Lindsay said. “Now we have because of this.”

Byline: Tiffany Hsu and Sheera Frenkel &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Hsu reports on misinformation and disinformation and its origins, movement and consequences. She has been a journalist for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheera Frenkel is a reporter based in the San Francisco Bay Area, covering the ways technology impacts everyday lives with a focus on social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
Highlight: The Israel-Hamas conflict has produced a prodigious amount of disinformation, putting people who fact-check claims — especially those who live in the region — back on their heels.
Body


In the frantic early hours of Oct. 7, amid wailing sirens and word of gunfights along Israel’s southern border, Achiya Schatz rushed with his toddler and heavily pregnant wife into a bomb shelter near Tel Aviv.
He did not stay long.
The first reports of the Hamas attack were already fusing with rumors, sweeping into social media feeds and private chat groups in an emotionally charged and largely unverified mass. Mr. Schatz, one of the best-known disinformation researchers and fact checkers in Israel, rushed back home to his computer, knowing he had little time to stop the false claims from metastasizing.
In a way, he was already too late.
Since the initial attack, disinformation watchdogs in the region have been overwhelmed by unfounded narratives, manipulated media and conspiracy theories. The content has spread in enormous volumes at great speed: video game clips and old news reports masquerading as current footage, attempts to disavow authentic photos as artificially generated, inaccurate translations and false accusations distributed in multiple languages.
In the fog of war, rumors and lies are especially dangerous, capable of taking on the veneer of fact and affecting decisions. Fact checkers and misinformation analysts are meant to be part of the defense, offering a cleareyed examination of the available evidence.
The work, however, is hard even for seasoned professionals, who faced pushback while fighting false and misleading narratives across multiple elections and a pandemic. In the Mideast, where fact-checking websites and disinformation research are relatively nascent and often poorly funded, the challenges have been compounded.
“You don’t have a lot of established fact-checking organizations with long track records in the region, and that makes it harder,” said Angie Drobnic Holan, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network, which supports fact checkers worldwide. “On the ground, it’s a new area that needs development.”
Many Israeli and Palestinian fact checkers entered the field within the past few years. They have done valuable work, sometimes without pay, in recent months trying to ferret out the facts from a combat zone, Ms. Holan said. Their proximity to the conflict makes them deeply invested in the truth, and better equipped to understand the cultural nuances that shape it.
It also exposes them to accusations of bias. Neutrality can be difficult in a region where political and religious differences have been hotly contested for generations, and even more so during an intensely polarizing war.
Adding to the difficulty: Access to reliable information is spotty, especially in Gaza, where heavy bombardment and power outages disrupt efforts to vet claims. Harassment and threats have increased. Their mental health is in a precarious position — fact checkers face post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by ongoing exposure to violent and graphic imagery; some are mourning colleagues and relatives who have been killed.
The emotional burden presses hard on Baker Mohammad Abdulhaq, a journalist and fact checker in Nablus, a Palestinian city in the West Bank less than 50 miles from Jerusalem. Eight years ago, he founded a fact-checking initiative called Tahaqaq Observatory, which translates to “verification.” Between Oct. 7 and Dec. 25, he and his team of nine fact checkers published an average of nearly two reports a day — nearly four times their September rate.
Conducting their research has been a bruising process, sometimes requiring them “to witness harsh scenes in Gaza of children and women killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes,” Mr. Abdulhaq said over email.
“We also directly communicate with their families, collecting harrowing testimonies from those who suffer, creating significant psychological pressure,” he said.
Tahaqaq’s main audience is Palestinian, and most of its reports are written in Arabic. Many are not flattering toward Israel: Mr. Abdulhaq and his team have evaluated inaccurate claims about prisoner exchanges and concerns that Israel used white phosphorus against civilians. Tahaqaq, he said, was targeted by 179 cyberattacks trying to disable the website on Oct. 23 after writing about the deadly explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City.
Mr. Abdulhaq said he had some harrowing interactions with Israeli authorities before Oct. 7, including a weekslong detention in 2018 in an Israeli jail after returning from a conference about Palestinian issues in Lebanon and receiving a media award in Cairo. He said he was questioned about his journalistic activities, then released without any charges. 
Such experiences, however, have limited effect on his fact-checking, he said.
Tahaqaq has also examined false and misleading claims from Palestinian and other Arab accounts, including a video mistranslated to suggest that an Israeli officer was bemoaning the difficulty of fighting Hamas when he was actually discussing the precision and professionalism of his troops. Another video that purported to show a Palestinian child whose entire family had been killed by Israeli airstrikes actually documented a boy who survived floods in Tajikistan over the summer.
Tahaqaq began in 2015 as part of Mr. Abdulhaq’s master’s thesis on fact-checking. It ran out of money two years later, then spun back up in 2020 to report out claims about Covid-19. Now, the group relies on donated time from its fact checkers and occasional financial assistance through the Arab Fact-Checkers Network.
The network, a three-year-old project run by the media organization Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism, includes more than 250 fact checkers from Egypt, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere. Saja Mortada, the Lebanese journalist in charge of the network, said the war between Israel and Hamas has been the most complicated crisis to monitor in a year that also included claims related to the war in Sudan, earthquakes in Syria and Morocco, and storms in Libya.
“Fear and uncertainty can make false information spread rapidly, as people might easily believe and share things that match what they’re afraid of, or already think,” she said.
The warning signs of such a misinformation surge were immediately evident to Mr. Schatz, the Israeli researcher, on Oct. 7.
“I was in shock, like everyone else, but I realized that it is exactly in that state of shock that the worst type of things materialize and go viral on the internet,” he said. 
His group, FakeReporter, relies on a team of 14 people to research and vet conspiracies and rumors circulating on social media. It is known for discovering an Iranian disinformation campaign in 2021 that used WhatsApp groups to sow confusion among Israelis. That fall, the organization also uncovered WhatsApp groups formed by Israeli extremists to attempt attacks against Palestinian nationals. FakeReporter’s findings have been cited in both left-wing and right-wing Israeli publications.
Mr. Schatz came to disinformation research through political activism. He joined fellow Israeli reservists in a group that protested the country’s military occupation of the Palestinian territories and, in 2020, participated along with thousands of other Israelis in demonstrations against government corruption.
He began to notice strange claims about the protesters appearing in the WhatsApp groups that were used to plan and carry out the rallies. Accounts that used odd syntax would join the group and quickly spread false claims that the demonstrators were being paid or intentionally gathering in large crowds to spread Covid. Rumors that the Israeli government was deploying online bots to plant disinformation had long circulated, he said, but were little studied.
“The tactics were so manipulative, it seemed like something bigger was going on,” he said. He eventually traced some of the misleading posts about protesters to bot accounts.
Later that year, Mr. Schatz started FakeReporter with five friends. The project asked Israeli activists to report strange or misleading social media accounts and WhatsApp messages; thousands of messages flooded in. After a year of full-time unpaid work, the group began turning to grants and donations to help fund its efforts.
Mr. Schatz said that reporting on misinformation requires people to put aside their politics. His team receives claims to analyze from Israelis across the political spectrum, and the group recently began accepting reports in Arabic as well. During the first month of the war, the group debunked footage that claimed to show Israeli children held in cages in Gaza. (The footage was years old, and it was unclear where it had originated.) It also debunked claims that Israel had fabricated, or used artificial intelligence, to fake its own civilians’ deaths at the Nova music festival.
“We work hard to stick to what we know or don’t know, and to leave aside our political opinions,” Mr. Schatz said. “Especially now, in a time of war, we have to work carefully to not let our opinions cloud what is factual and what is not.”

Israel says Hamas routinely operates within -- and beneath -- places like Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, using them as shields, and has held Israeli hostages there. The group denies the charges.
The Israeli military on Thursday raided the largest hospital still functioning in the Gaza Strip, in what it called a search for Hamas fighters and the bodies of hostages. Many people who had sought shelter there were forced to flee from combat once again.  
  Explosions and gunfire rocked the hospital in the city of Khan Younis, the Nasser Medical Complex, before the predawn raid, killing and wounding several people including at least one doctor and a patient, according to a doctor there, as well as the charity Doctors Without Borders, which had staff members at the hospital, and Gaza health authorities. The specific casualty claims, like many assertions in the conflict, could not be immediately confirmed.
  Videos posted on social media on Thursday and voice messages sent by doctors during the night, both before and after Israeli forces smashed through the perimeter wall and entered the compound, depicted scenes of chaos and fear inside the damaged, smoke-filled hospital, punctuated by automatic gunfire, explosions and shouting.
  One video, verified by The New York Times, showed damage to the hospital and injured people being rushed through a smoke-filled corridor among debris amid sounds of gunfire. Witnesses said people by the hundreds -- possibly thousands -- later stood in long lines as Israeli troops screened them, a few at a time, for evacuation.
  The Israeli military said it had detained dozens of people, but did not say who or why.
  ''We have credible intelligence from a number of sources, including from released hostages, indicating that Hamas held hostages at the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, and that there may be bodies of our hostages in the Nasser hospital facility,'' Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military, said in a video statement.
  The military did not say whether hostages or Hamas fighters had been found. Ashraf al-Qudra, spokesman for the health ministry in Gaza, said that Israeli forces had used bulldozers to dig up graves on the hospital grounds.
  For two days before the raid, Israeli forces surrounding the medical center had told displaced people over loudspeakers to evacuate, signaling that a raid was coming, though international rights and medical groups warned of dire consequences. Some of the Palestinians who took refuge there did leave, but others said it was too dangerous -- some had tried and said that gunfire and airstrikes had forced them to turn back.
  Doctors and health officials said that some people who tried to flee on Tuesday were killed. Asked for comment, the Israeli military did not respond to specific allegations about people coming under fire.
  ''We really don't know what to do,'' a local journalist, Mohammed Salama, said in a video posted on Wednesday to social media. In the background, people lined up with sacks of belongings to leave the hospital, but he said people who tried to evacuate were forced to stand at checkpoint lines for hours.
  The Israeli military said Thursday that it had opened a ''humanitarian corridor'' for people leaving the hospital, but even then witnesses who fled said it was a harrowing and perilous experience.
  Gazan officials said that about 300 medical workers, 450 wounded patients and 8,000 people displaced from their homes elsewhere in the territory were on the hospital grounds when the week began. It was unclear how many were still there by Thursday morning.
  While trying to crush Hamas in Gaza, Israel also faces a conflict with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group based in Lebanon, which has stepped up its rocket fire on Israel in solidarity with Hamas. The two sides have traded dozens of attacks across Israel's northern border since October, and both have threatened further escalation. U.S. officials have counseled calm, trying to avoid the opening of a full-fledged second front in the war.
  Israeli forces carried out multiple airstrikes in Lebanon on Thursday, a day after a series of strikes that Lebanese state media said had killed 10 civilians, and that Hezbollah said had killed several of its fighters.
  The raid on Nasser hospital was ''a precise and limited operation,'' conducted by ''special forces who underwent special training for this mission,'' Admiral Hagari said. Israeli forces had not told patients or medical staff to leave, he added, saying that Israel in fact wanted the hospital to continue functioning.
  But by multiple accounts, most of the medical workers and patients did evacuate. Mr. Salama said that Israeli troops were telling doctors to leave, though not by the same route as others. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement, ''our medical staff have had to flee the hospital, leaving patients behind,'' and that ''one of our colleagues was detained'' by the Israelis.
  Dr. Islam Sawaly, a doctor at Nasser, said she and a group of others left the hospital around 3 a.m. and walked for more than four hours along a dark road pocked with potholes. ''We fell into sewage ditches,'' she said. Finally, they reached the area of Miraj, between Khan Younis and Rafah, the city along the border with Egypt where more than a million Gazans have sought refuge.
  Doctors Without Borders said only the sickest patients had stayed behind at Nasser, though the number was unclear. In voice memos shared by the group, a doctor at the hospital, whose name it withheld for his safety, said Israeli troops had ordered all remaining staff and patients into one building, the oldest in the complex, and that only about 40 employees were left.
  Before the raid began, a rocket struck the hospital at about 2 a.m., killing a patient in his bed and injuring six others, the doctor said in the voice message. Dr. Sawaly said another rocket strike had killed a doctor and left two other people with burns, though Gazan health officials said the doctor was injured but not killed.
  Hospitals have been a flashpoint throughout the war that began with the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel that Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage, of whom more than 130 are still thought to be held in Gaza. Talks mediated by Egypt and Qatar, on a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages, are underway this week in Cairo, but the two sides appear to be far apart.
  Israel has faced widespread international condemnation for its conduct in the war, which has killed more than 28,000 people in Gaza, the health authorities there say, and destroyed much of the enclave's infrastructure. Much of that criticism has focused on attacks on hospitals, mosques and schools, which are supposed to be protected under the laws of war.
  Israel has long accused Hamas, which had governed Gaza since 2007, of using such places as de facto military bases and the civilians there as human shields -- itself a violation of international law -- wagering that they are less likely to be targeted directly. In some cases, the Israelis contend, beneath those facilities are important nodes in Hamas's vast tunnel network. Hamas and hospital administrators deny the claims.
  Most of Gaza's hospitals have stopped operating as hospitals. Those that still do are overcrowded, many have been damaged, and they lack critical supplies. Israel says it has ensured the delivery of needed supplies to Nasser; the United Nations says Israel has blocked such deliveries.
  Israel has repeatedly ordered civilian evacuations, beginning in northern Gaza and working its way southward, displacing many people multiple times and steadily forcing them into more crowded spaces. Palestinians and aid groups say that amid falling bombs, street battles and scarce supplies, there is no safe place in Gaza.
  Khan Younis, one of the major cities of southern Gaza, has been the focus of ground combat for weeks, and Israeli officials describe it as a Hamas stronghold.
  More than half of Gaza's roughly 2.3 million people have sought refuge in Rafah, many of them sleeping in makeshift shelters and tents. Israeli officials have said the military will eventually enter Rafah in force, as well.

Israel and Hamas are battling near a hospital in Khan Younis, near where the military said it had detected mortar fire. About 7,000 people had sought shelter on the hospital grounds, the U.N. said.
Scores of displaced Palestinians fled the grounds of a hospital in southern Gaza as fighting raged on Wednesday in and around the city of Khan Younis, where the Israeli military says it is trying to crush a Hamas stronghold.
Videos verified by The New York Times show families fleeing the hospital, Nasser Medical Center in Khan Younis, carrying duffel bags, backpacks and blankets as the sound of explosions reverberated. The Israeli military said this week that they had detected mortar fire aimed at its forces from the hospital complex, the largest in the southern Gaza Strip.
The fighting around the hospital underlines the dangers for civilians in southern Gaza as the Israeli military converges on Khan Younis. About 7,000 people were believed to have been sheltering on the hospital’s grounds, the United Nations’ humanitarian office said on Wednesday, adding that an “intensification of hostilities” in the area also made it harder for patients and health workers to get access to the hospital.
Many displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza have relocated several times since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, an experience that has reinforced the feeling that nowhere is safe in the enclave. The Gazan health authorities say that more than 24,000 people, including women and children, have been killed in the enclave since then.
Hamas’s Khan Younis brigade is among the armed group’s last major forces, as their fighters in northern Gaza have been largely subdued, according to Israeli military officials. Israeli troops, led by the military’s 98th division, have been advancing into the Palestinian city since December, after the collapse of a brief cease-fire with Hamas.
Civilians, many of whom fled northern Gaza following Israeli evacuation orders, have taken refuge in makeshift tent cities, overflowing schools and on the grounds of hospitals.
The battles for southern Gaza, Israeli military officials say, are extremely challenging because of the presence of those civilians and Hamas’s tactic of embedding weapons and fighters among the population and around civilian infrastructure.
The fighting is further complicated by a network of war tunnels that Hamas constructed beneath the enclave, at times running beneath residential areas and, in at least one known instance, accessible from the grounds of a hospital.
Top Hamas leaders such as Yahya Sinwar — a native son of Khan Younis — may be hiding in fortified tunnels underneath his hometown, Israeli officials say. If so, they add, he has most likely surrounded himself with some of the more than 100 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza — another stumbling block.
The southern portion of the Gaza Strip is about seven miles wide. But in a measure of the difficulty Israel is having in gaining control of that part of Gaza, the military said on Wednesday it had airdropped 16 tons of ammunition, fuel, water and food for its troops there.
Amid the Israeli airstrikes and intense fighting, hospitals in Gaza have struggled to deal with a seemingly constant stream of wounded people, grossly inadequate medical supplies, unsanitary conditions and significant staffing challenges.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that Nasser and two other major hospitals in Gaza were at risk of being shut down because of evacuation orders for areas next to the medical facilities, as well as fighting close by.
The World Health Organization reported that Nasser hospital alone treated 700 patients on Monday, double its usual daily caseload, requiring some patients to be cared for on the floor. Only 15 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are even partly functional, the W.H.O. said.
Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals for military purposes, and its raid on Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza revealed a stone-and-concrete tunnel shaft below the hospital. Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa Hospital in November, a move that officials from the Gaza Health Ministry said put the hospital out of service at the time.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman of the Israeli military, said on Tuesday that the army had detected the launch of a munition from the Nasser complex toward Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military later clarified that he had been referring to mortar fire.
“The Hamas terrorist organization systematically operates in Gaza’s hospitals and nearby areas using civilians as human shields,” he wrote on social media.
Hamas denies its fighters have used hospitals as bases for their operations.
The Times was not able to reach medical workers at the hospital on Wednesday as a near-total communications blackout across the Gaza Strip continued for a sixth consecutive day, leaving besieged civilians unable to call for help and aid workers struggling to reach them as Israeli airstrikes rained down on the south.
Paltel, the strip’s largest telecommunications company, said the blackout was the longest of several Gaza had faced since the start of the war.
Airstrikes and fighting between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants in Khan Younis have been so intense that repair crews have had trouble reaching the damaged sites, Paltel said. Last week, two of its workers, in the process of making repairs, were killed when a company car was fired upon, Paltel said, adding that it had coordinated the repairs with the Israeli authorities in advance. The Israeli military said the episode had been referred for investigation.
Even as the fighting continued, some officials were looking ahead to reconstruction once hostilities had ended. Rebuilding housing will cost at least $15 billion, Mohammad Mustafa, the chairman of the Palestine Investment Fund, whose board is appointed by the president of the Palestinian Authority, said on Wednesday. Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, Mr. Mustafa said the estimate did not include hospitals and infrastructure damaged or destroyed.
The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, who was also in Davos, said on Wednesday that the civilian suffering in Gaza was “gut wrenching” and that American officials had spoken to Israeli officials about their responsibility to minimize civilian casualties and facilitate humanitarian aid.
Mr. Blinken’s comments, while cast in unusually sharp language, were also a defense of the Biden administration’s approach to the conflict, in which it has strongly backed Israel’s war against Hamas while pressing Israeli officials to limit harm to Palestinian civilians.
“The suffering we’re seeing among innocent men, women and children breaks my heart,” he said in response to questions by The Times columnist Thomas Friedman. “The question is, what is to be done?”
“We’ve made judgments about how we thought we could be most effective in trying to shape this in ways to get more humanitarian assistance to people to get better protections and minimize civilian casualties,” he went on. “Every step along the way, not only have we impressed upon Israel its responsibilities to do that, we’ve seen some progress in areas where, absent our engagement, I don’t believe it would have happened.”
Mr. Blinken’s comments were consistent with the U.S. government’s broad political and military support for Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, which began after the Hamas-led attack killed about 1,200 people and more than 200 others were taken hostage on Oct. 7, Israeli officials said. 
Also on Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had killed a Palestinian militant commander, Abdullah Abu Shalal, alongside several fellow fighters in the occupied West Bank in an airstrike targeting their vehicle.
The army described Mr. Abu Shalal as the commander of a militant cell based in the city of Nablus that was planning an “imminent” attack against Israelis. Palestinian officials said the men were members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades, an armed group loosely affiliated with Fatah, the dominant Palestinian political faction in the West Bank.

U.S. Strike Kills a Leader Of a Militia Tied to Iran

The killing of a leader of Kata'ib Hezbollah continued a series of strikes in retaliation for attacks on U.S. troops in the region, including one that killed three Americans in Jordan.
A U.S. Special Operations retaliatory drone strike in the Iraqi capital on Wednesday killed a senior leader of a militia that U.S. officials blame for recent attacks on American personnel, the Pentagon said, following up on President Biden's promise that the response to a slew of attacks by Shiite militias would continue. 
  The Pentagon said the man was a leader of Kata'ib Hezbollah, the militia that officials have said was responsible for the drone attack in Jordan last month that killed three American service members and injured more than 40.
  A U.S. official said that the strike was a ''dynamic'' hit on the militia commander, whom American intelligence officials had been tracking for some time. A second official said the United States reserved the right to strike other Shiite militia leaders and commanders.
  Videos from the scene showed the wreckage of a vehicle in a neighborhood of eastern Baghdad, and a nearby fire.
  A senior Kata'ib Hezbollah official and Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps both said that two commanders had been killed in the strike. Witnesses said identification cards found nearby identified them as Arkan al-Elayawi and Abu Baqir al-Saedi.
  In response, crowds gathered in the streets of Baghdad, chanting ''America is the devil.''
  Maj. Gen. Tahsin al-Khafaji, a spokesman for Iraq's security services, called the strike ''an aggression,'' and said it ''violated Iraqi sovereignty and risked dangerous repercussions in the region.''
  Wednesday's strike came after three quieter days in the Mideast, following American salvos on Friday and Saturday that began what Mr. Biden and his aides have said will be a sustained campaign of retaliation.
  On Monday, the Pentagon said that American warplanes had destroyed or severely damaged most of the Iranian and militia targets they had struck in Syria and Iraq on Friday.
  Maj. Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said that ''more than 80'' of some 85 targets in Syria and Iraq had been destroyed or rendered inoperable. The targets, he said, included command hubs; intelligence centers; depots for rockets, missiles and attack drones; as well as logistics and ammunition bunkers.
  Kata'ib Hezbollah, based in Iraq, is considered a proxy of Iran, and the United States considers the group a terrorist organization.
  U.S. officials blame Iran and the militias aligned with it for what had become a near-daily barrage of rocket and drone attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the war between Hamas and Israel began on Oct. 7. The Biden administration has sought to calibrate retaliatory airstrikes to deter such groups while avoiding a wider war.
  But when a drone attack hit a remote base in Jordan on Jan. 28, killing three American service members, administration officials said that a red line had been crossed, and Mr. Biden promised a sustained campaign of retaliation.
  After that strike, Kata'ib Hezbollah said it would halt attacks on American forces, at the behest of the governments of Iraq and Iran, reflecting Iran's reluctance to directly confront the United States. But other groups involved in such attacks have not made similar commitments.
  The back-and-forth attacks in Syria, Iraq and Jordan -- not to mention the tit-for-tat strikes that the United States and its allies have exchanged with the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen -- have edged the region closer to a broader conflict, even as the administration insists it does not want war with Iran. Instead, U.S. officials say they are focused on whittling away the militias' formidable arsenals and deterring additional attacks against U.S. troops as well as merchant ships in the Red Sea.
  But by targeting Kata'ib Hezbollah commanders, the administration is sending a message to Iran and the militias that it backs that every American life taken will be met with a strong response, U.S. officials said.
  In January the Pentagon said the U.S. had killed a leader of another Iraqi militia, Haraqat al Nujaba, who was involved in planning and carrying out attacks against American personnel in Iraq and Syria.
  National security experts and officials say privately that to truly degrade the capability of the Iran-backed militias, the United States would have to carry out a yearslong campaign similar to the six-year effort to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
  Even then, the officials say, the militias, with Iran's backing, could probably survive longer than the Islamic State, which was pressured by the United States and Iran, and even Russia. The United States would also have to target many more senior leaders and commanders.

Israel mobilized 300,000 reservists amid signs that it could be preparing for a major ground invasion of Gaza, and it bombed hundreds of sites, including mosques and a marketplace.
Israel ordered a ''complete siege'' of the Gaza Strip on Monday as it retaliated for the largest and deadliest incursion into its territory in decades, while Hamas threatened to respond to the Israeli bombing campaign by executing civilians its fighters took hostage in Israel. 
  Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel said that ''no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel'' would be allowed into Gaza, the crowded and impoverished coastal territory that is already under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt. Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites in Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas, including mosques and a marketplace, while Israeli troops battled to regain control of towns overrun on Saturday by Hamas gunmen.
  More than 900 people have been killed in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said. More than 2,600 have been wounded since the incursion began early Saturday, and Hamas gunmen were holding about 150 hostages, the Israeli government said. The spokesman for Hamas's military wing, Abu Obeida, said the group would execute a civilian hostage every time an airstrike hit Gazans ''in their homes without warning.''
  At least 687 Palestinians were killed and at least 3,726 injured, the authorities in Gaza said. The death toll is believed to include not only the casualties in Gaza, but also some of the assailants who were killed in the attack on Israel, though it was not immediately clear how many.
  Israel mobilized 300,000 military reservists, an enormous number for a country of 9 million people, amid signs that it could be preparing for a major ground invasion of Gaza and the possible opening of another front against the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah in the north.
  In a televised address on Monday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has warned of a long war ahead, vowed to ''eliminate'' Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu, who leads the most right-wing government in his nation's history, called on the opposition to ''immediately establish a national emergency government without preconditions.''
  Lt. Col. Richard Hecht of the Israel Defense Forces told reporters on Monday that the next phase of fighting would not resemble recent conflicts with Gaza, in which Palestinian groups fired rockets but claimed relatively few casualties, and Israel would respond primarily with airstrikes. ''We are in a different game here,'' he said. ''We are at war with Hamas.''
  A stunned disbelief enveloped Israel, which appeared to have been caught entirely by surprise by the attack and had gone 50 years without enduring an assault on this scale or with so many casualties. Adding to the shock were the mass hostage-takings and the fact that fighting on Israeli soil continued into a third day. Families were watching men and women who had finished their mandatory military service being called back to duty, while the names of the dead scrolled across television screens.
  An Israeli airstrike on Monday devastated a busy open-air marketplace in northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, where Gazans anticipating a long fight had flocked to stock up on food and other supplies. A Red Crescent paramedic, who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity, said 60 people were killed there.
  Videos shared on social media and distributed by Palestinian news agencies showed bodies strewn amid the debris of what moments earlier had been stands selling produce and other goods. Broken concrete and twisted metal from the surrounding buildings filled the square, and people made their way through the debris, smoke and dust, looking for survivors.
  ''Is he dead? Is he dead?'' a man was heard yelling in one video.
  Israeli strikes also hit four mosques in the Shati refugee camp on Monday, according to Gaza authorities, toppling their domes and killing worshipers inside. Neighbors picked through the rubble of the Sousi mosque, where witnesses said boys had been playing soccer just outside when it was destroyed.
  Israel's military said it had carried out more than 500 airstrikes overnight, targeting operations centers of Hamas and another group, Islamic Jihad. It confirmed hitting several mosques, saying that they contained Hamas infrastructure or fighters.
  The United Nations and Palestinian officials said that at least two hospitals and multiple homes had also been hit, and many Gazans said they had nowhere to go to escape the Israeli strikes.
  President Biden said at least 11 U.S. citizens were confirmed killed in the Hamas attack, and an unknown number were unaccounted for. ''While we are still working to confirm, we believe it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas,'' he said in a written statement.
  He vowed to work with Israel ''on every aspect of the hostage crisis,'' including sharing intelligence and deploying experts.
  Mr. Biden and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy also released a statement late Monday condemning ''Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism.''
  Many other foreign nationals were reported dead, wounded or missing, including 12 Thais killed, 11 kidnapped and nine wounded, according to their government. France said two of its nationals were killed and 14 were unaccounted for.
  Israel has asked the United States to supply it with more precision-guided munitions for its warplanes and more missiles for its Iron Dome air defense system, requests the Biden administration is working on, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. A senior Pentagon official said the United States was already accelerating shipments of such weapons.
  More than 100 people were killed over the weekend in a Hamas assault on an Israeli kibbutz, Be'eri, said Moti Bukjin, a spokesman for the ZAKA relief organization, which was recovering bodies there on Monday. ''It was horrible work. There were killed children there,'' he said, adding that there were dozens of dead militants in the town as well.
  At least 109 people were killed by gunmen who swarmed into a weekend music festival at a venue in Israel three miles from the Gaza border on Saturday. But ZAKA volunteers later reported recovering an estimated 260 bodies at the site of the rave, Mr. Bukjin said. Videos show panicked concertgoers fleeing south into the desert and more than 100 abandoned vehicles on the side of the road.
  Hamas's armed wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said four Israelis were killed in one of the Israeli airstrikes, along with the Palestinian gunmen who were holding them captive, a claim that could not be independently verified.
  A new barrage of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza injured seven people on Monday, officials said, while sirens blared in Jerusalem and across central Israel. Schools remained closed and flights in and out of the country were curtailed.
  Israeli leaders are concerned that Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia allied with Iran, could enter the fight, and Israeli military units in the north are on high alert. Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006.
  Fighting escalated on Monday on that front, along Israel's northern frontier with Lebanon, with Islamic Jihad claiming responsibility for small cross-border attacks there, a day after Hezbollah fired on Israeli posts and Israeli forces fired back. Israel's military said on Monday that it had struck three Hezbollah posts in Lebanon, and Hezbollah said that three of its fighters had been killed. The group later said it had carried out attacks on two Israeli military barracks, using guided missiles and mortars.
  It was not clear what prompted the timing of the most audacious attack Hamas has ever launched on Israel. Hamas is backed by Iran, as is Islamic Jihad, and Tehran is eager to derail a possible diplomatic deal between its two regional archenemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian foreign ministry denied that its government had any role in the fighting. U.S. officials said that no evidence had emerged so far of Iranian involvement, but that Iran was complicit in the attack, given its years of support for Hamas.
  Israel's chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, declared on Monday that the army had regained control of border communities, though ''there may still be terrorists in the area.'' But a short time later the military said soldiers and armed militants were exchanging gunfire in Kfar Azza, an Israeli village near the border.
  Colonel Hecht said in a news briefing on Monday that Israeli special forces troops were trying to dislodge militants from a civilian area.
  ''We thought by this morning we'd be in a better place,'' he said.
  Israeli rescue workers were still extracting the bodies of civilians who were killed in their homes by Hamas gunmen on Saturday.
  Mr. Netanyahu warned local leaders in southern Israel to prepare for a long fight, his office said.
  ''I know you have been through tough and terrible things. What Hamas will go through will be tough and terrible,'' he told them, according to his office. ''We are already in the midst of a battle that has only just begun.''
  The United Nations humanitarian agency said Israeli strikes had displaced 123,000 Gazans, and damaged water, sanitation and hygiene facilities affecting more than 400,000 people. The only power plant providing electricity to Gaza could run out of fuel in a few days, aid agencies have said.
  In the north, Israel's Home Front Command instructed the residents of 28 towns and villages near the border with Lebanon to go to bomb shelters and other protected spaces. The residents were told to take food, water, mattresses, and blankets, signaling that they may need to stay there for a while.
  The Lebanese Army said Israeli planes and artillery struck near the towns of Dhayra and Aita al Shaab close to the border with Israel earlier on Monday. The military instructed Lebanese civilians ''not to go to areas adjacent to the border for the sake of their safety.''

The fast-moving events highlighted the difficulty of covering the war between Israel and Hamas.
The shifting coverage about a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza highlighted the difficulties of reporting on a fast-moving war in which few journalists remain on the ground while claims fly freely on social media.
The first reports of a strike at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City came early Tuesday afternoon Eastern time. A spokeswoman for the Gaza health ministry said an Israeli airstrike had caused the explosion, killing at least 200 people. In a televised interview, a health ministry spokesman later said the death toll exceeded 500 — which the ministry later changed to “hundreds.”
The news changed quickly over a couple of hours. Many Western news organizations, including The New York Times, reported the Gazan claims in prominent headlines and articles. They adjusted the coverage after the Israeli military issued a statement urging “caution” about the Gazan allegation. The news organizations then reported the Israeli military’s assertion that the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas.
On Wednesday, American officials agreed with Israel, saying early intelligence indicated that the launch did not come from Israel and instead was caused by the armed Palestinian group. Most of the coverage about the blast on Wednesday focused on the U.S. analysis.
But many supporters of each side had already made up their minds in the ensuing hours. Much of the Arab world united in support of Palestinians, with thousands of protesters marching in cities across the Middle East on Tuesday night and Wednesday, blaming Israel for the deaths of civilians at the hospital.
Kathleen Carroll, a former executive editor of The Associated Press, said the situation in Gaza was tough for news organizations to handle because they could not always get firsthand or verified accounts. As Israel prepares for a ground assault in Gaza, most Western journalists have evacuated the area, and reporters that remain face shellings and shortages of water, food and electricity.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday that at least 19 journalists had been killed during the conflict, 15 of them Palestinian.
“It’s extremely difficult,” Ms. Carroll said. “In Gaza, there are so few news organizations able to be on the ground and getting the kind of eyewitness reporting that helps.”
Covering wars is always fraught, both because journalists on the ground are often in harm’s way and because the sides at war aggressively push information in their favor.
The war between Israel and Hamas has proved even more difficult than most conflicts, because it has generated vast amounts of misleading and false information online. There are so many untrue claims that some people question the true ones.
It takes time to independently verify the claims from all sides. In the separate conflict between Russia and Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine initially blamed Russia for a deadly missile strike on Sept. 6 in eastern Ukraine. But a New York Times investigation, published 12 days later, found that an errant Ukrainian air defense missile was most likely the cause. The investigation relied on combing through satellite imagery, missile fragments, witness accounts and social media posts.
The coverage of this week’s hospital blast generally represented what had been said about the explosion at the time of publication. The BBC’s initial breaking news report said, “Hundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli airstrike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say.” A later headline was “Israel denies airstrike on hospital in Gaza, saying failed militant rocket to blame.”
The Times sent a news alert at 2:51 p.m. Eastern time carrying the Palestinian assertion of an Israeli missile strike on the hospital. When the Israeli military statement came out, The Times sent another news alert on Israel’s assertion that “a misfired Palestinian rocket” was to blame.
Not all large global news outlets made similar changes. Al Jazeera, the news organization funded by the Qatari government, continued to report on Tuesday evening that Israel was to blame for the attack. It included a blog post with Israel’s denial, but added a comment from one of its own reporters, who said Israel regularly deflected blame for attacks that killed civilians on misfiring rockets. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera continued to report that the blast was an “Israeli attack.”
The BBC and Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Times spokesman said, “We report what we know as we learn it.”
“We apply rigor and care to what we publish, explicitly citing sources and noting when a piece of news is breaking and likely to be updated,” he said.
Bill Grueskin, a professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, said media organizations had to be “exceptionally careful” in dealing with news around the Israel-Hamas conflict, and should be transparent about where they are getting their information, “particularly when it’s from official channels that have vested interests in promulgating a particular point of view.”
Ms. Carroll echoed that sentiment, and said news organizations had to refrain from trying to fill in knowledge gaps with speculation.
“There’s so much mistrust on all sides and in all directions,” Ms. Carroll said. “It’s incredibly hard to walk that line, practically impossible to present a news story in whatever format that’s going to be believed by all parties.”

Israel increases evacuations as clashes with Hezbollah escalate
As conflict intensified on Israel’s border with Lebanon, Israeli authorities said they were expanding a state-funded evacuation plan to an additional 14 villages. Along with a rare airstrike on the West Bank, the fighting raised fears that the war could expand.
Israel’s military said that attacks from Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia that controls southern Lebanon, had resulted in civilian and military casualties. Amid concerns that the conflict could spill over, the Pentagon said on Saturday that it was sending an antimissile battery and battalions of the Patriot ground-based air defense system to the Middle East. 
Israeli forces massed along the border with Gaza yesterday ahead of an expected ground invasion of the enclave. Israel’s military efforts to eradicate Hamas “may take a month, two, or three, but in the end, Hamas will no longer exist,” the country’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said yesterday.
Violence also has been surging across the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israel carried out an airstrike against what it described as an underground “terror compound” beneath a mosque in the city of Jenin. The claims had not been independently verified. Two people were killed, according to Palestinian health officials.
Gaza aid: Humanitarian groups and the U.N. continued to warn that the first shipment of aid that arrived in Gaza on Saturday — 20 trucks carrying food, water and medicine — was just a fraction of what was needed. Another 14 aid trucks entered Gaza last night.
The toll: Israel’s bombardment continued “almost unabated,” while Palestinian armed groups continued with their “indiscriminate rocket firing,” the U.N. said. The death toll in Gaza has reached at least 4,385, and there are more than 13,500 injuries, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. In Israel, no new fatalities were reported, but injuries had increased to almost 5,000, the U.N. said.
A warning: The Israeli military warned that residents of northern Gaza who did not flee to the southern part of the enclave “may be considered a partner in a terrorist organization.” But many people there said that leaving was not an option because of the cost and that it would not guarantee safety.
“We can’t even afford to eat,” Amani Abu Odeh said. “We don’t have the money to leave.” 
An Australian mogul may testify against Trump 
Anthony Pratt, one of Australia’s wealthiest men, made his way into Donald Trump’s inner circle with money and flattery. In covert recordings, Pratt described Trump’s business practices as being “like the mafia.”
Their interactions were ultimately swept up in one of the two federal criminal cases against Trump, in which the former U.S. president is charged with taking classified documents from the White House when he left office. Pratt could testify against Trump at a trial next year.
In his interviews with prosecutors, Pratt recounted how Trump once revealed to him sensitive information about U.S. nuclear submarines — including the number of warheads they travel with and their stealthy proximity to Russian waters — an episode that Trump denies.
Indigenous Australians say ‘reconciliation is dead’ 
Australia’s rejection last week of the Indigenous Voice to Parliament — a proposed advisory body — is likely to lead to an irreversible shift in the nation’s relationship with its first peoples.
Many Indigenous people perceived it as a denial of their past and their place in Australia, which is far behind other colonized nations in reconciling with its first inhabitants. The defeat of the Voice could not only derail any further reconciliation, but could also unleash a much more confrontational approach to Indigenous rights and race relations in Australia.

While world attention focuses on the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, a battle has been slowly brewing in the other Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank. At least 46 Palestinians have been killed, and another 700 people injured, in sporadic clashes with Israeli forces and settlers that have broken out in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel Saturday morning. Ten of the people were killed on Friday during confrontations with Israeli forces that took place at several locations in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. 
The violence on Friday began after thousands of Palestinians set off on marches in solidarity with Gaza, some waving Hamas flags, after weekly prayers. Hamas, which controls Gaza, had called for a ''day of rage,'' urging Palestinians to confront Israeli forces and settlers in protest of Israel's retaliatory strikes on the blockaded enclave. But tensions are not new in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are experiencing the deadliest year in nearly two decades. At least 246 Palestinians have been killed, many in gun battles with Israeli forces carrying out raids into Palestinian towns. The number of violent incidents attributed to Israeli settlers this year has also reached the highest level since at least 2006, the first year since the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs began tracking the incidents. The conflict in Gaza has exacerbated tensions in the West Bank, where some Palestinians support Hamas. Many also view the Palestinian Authority -- the semiautonomous body that governs the West Bank and was forced out of Gaza by Hamas in 2007 -- as a subcontractor for Israel, helping maintain the occupation. The atrocities by Hamas assailants in southern Israel on Saturday have angered hard-line Israeli settlers. Messages have been circulating in WhatsApp groups and on social media calling on settlers to arm themselves and confront Palestinians. ''We can't rely on the army alone to protect us,'' read one message that was sent on Friday to a WhatsApp group with over 8,000 followers. On Friday, settlers shot at Palestinian worshipers leaving a mosque in Yatta, a West Bank city near Hebron, and injured one, according to a witness and videos posted on social media. One resident of Yatta, Basel Adra, 27, said that Palestinians have endured growing harassment in recent days by settlers, who now appear to be moving through the area with weapons. In Qusra, a village near Hebron, armed settlers killed four Palestinians on Wednesday, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The next day settlers and Israeli soldiers shot at the funeral procession, killing a father and his son, the ministry said. In response to the violence in Qusra, the Israel Defense Forces said that a number of Palestinian casualties were reported following clashes between settlers and Palestinians. It did not say how many.

The instant I understood the scale of Hamas’s attack on Israel, I understood the probable response. As I read reports of Hamas terrorists murdering entire families, raping Israeli women beside the bodies of their dead friends and dragging Israeli hostages into Gaza, it was apparent that Hamas had chosen to behave like ISIS, and if it behaved like ISIS, then the Israel Defense Forces were justified in treating Hamas in Gaza the same way the United States and its allies treated ISIS in Iraq.
The comparison is not lost on Israel. After the attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Hamas is ISIS. And just as the forces of civilization united to defeat ISIS, the forces of civilization must support Israel in defeating Hamas.”
This means Israel’s goal is not to punish Hamas but to defeat it — to remove it from power in Gaza the way the Iraqi military, the United States and their allies removed ISIS from Mosul, Falluja, Ramadi and every other city ISIS controlled in Iraq. That can’t be accomplished by air power alone. If removing Hamas from power is the goal, then that almost certainly means soldiers and tanks fighting in Gazan cities, block by block, house to house in an area of roughly two million people.
The purpose of this newsletter is to give you a primer on both the military difficulty of the task and the humanitarian constraints on it, along with the limitations that are unique to Israel. It, like every other advanced democracy, is bound by the law of armed conflict. This means Israel may not treat Gaza the way, say, the Soviet Army treated Berlin in 1945. Even in its rage and pain, Israel may not level cities without regard for innocent life.
There is a model for Israeli victory in Gaza, but that model also illustrates the magnitude of the challenge. In the fall of 2016, around 100,000 Iraqi security forces and their allies massed outside Mosul and faced a daunting task: to remove the Islamic State from a vast, densely populated city when that army was deeply embedded in the city and had been able to prepare elaborate defenses.
Compounding the problem were that the civilian population, unlike during other recent urban battles in Iraq, largely remained in the city and that ISIS had no desire to facilitate a civilian evacuation. When the United States entered Falluja in 2004 during its war against Al Qaeda in Iraq, a vast majority of civilians had already fled. When soldiers and Marines engaged insurgents in street battles there, there were far fewer civilians in the zone of combat.
Mosul, by contrast, was largely fought in and around the civilian population and was at the time quite possibly the largest and deadliest urban battle since the end of World War II. Iraqi soldiers — supported by American air power — assaulted a city of more than one million people. The resulting battle took nine months to complete; killed thousands of ISIS fighters, by most estimates; cost the Iraqi security forces thousands of casualties; and, despite considerable efforts to protect noncombatants, killed up to 11,000 civilians. But Iraq won, ISIS lost, and ISIS no longer controls Mosul.
How does this fight compare with a battle in the heart of Gaza? The Israel Defense Forces will be better trained and more prepared than the Iraqi security forces — with a greater capacity to protect noncombatants — but if Israeli military history informs the present situation, the Israel Defense Forces will not have the luxury of time. It will almost certainly have to execute its major combat operations in much less than the nine months it took to defeat ISIS in Mosul.
To help me more fully understand the nature of the battle in Gaza, I called John Spencer, the chairman of urban warfare studies at West Point’s Modern Warfare Institute. The conversation made one thing very clear to me and resonated with my training and experience as a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom: Israel’s military mission is inseparable from its legal obligations. When a nation abides by the law of war, which Israel requires its soldiers to do, it fundamentally changes the way it fights and the experiences of its soldiers on the ground.
For example, a nation that disregards the law of war often approaches urban combat by destroying as much of the city as it can to weaken defenses before the attack and then, when it enters the city, it presumes structures are full of enemies and destroys buildings at will.
When a nation complies with the law of war, the presumptions switch. Civilian structures are presumed to be benign unless solid intelligence or hostile action demonstrates otherwise. As a practical matter, this means that air power alone is insufficient for the job. As Spencer told me, aircraft “can’t see through steel-reinforced concrete,” so tanks and troops have to enter a city to truly clear it.
But when they do, the defender gets an initial advantage. As Spencer said, the “attacker has to walk down the street and take a punch to the face.” Then it can respond. Israel understands that reality and adjusts its tactics accordingly, often leading with armored vehicles that can take the punch without incurring casualties.
Don’t think for a moment, however, that use of precision weapons means that cities can endure invasions without suffering terrifying damage. Before and after aerial views of Mosul reveal incredible devastation. Iraqi forces were generally less trained than the Israel Defense Forces, but that doesn’t account for the full extent of the destruction. Much of the damage was the result of the large-scale use of America’s most precise weapons. Spencer told me that the U.S. dangerously depleted its stocks of its extremely precise Hellfire missiles during the battle.
Spencer called the widespread destruction inflicted by precise weapons the “precision paradox.” I’ve also heard it described as spiderwebbing. Imagine if you have 10 ISIS fighters in one building. Iraqi forces call in an airstrike, and U.S. forces hit the building with a missile or bomb, but it doesn’t kill every fighter in the building. The remaining fighters scatter to two or three nearby buildings, which are then precisely targeted by additional munitions. The result is a form of slow-motion demolition, in which each strike might be quite precise but the cumulative effect can eventually make the city look as if it had been carpet-bombed.
We’re already seeing the phenomenon in Gaza. We are witnessing nothing like the immediate mass destruction of an indiscriminate attack, but large numbers of precision attacks can still inflict extreme (and deadly) damage.
If civilians aren’t evacuated from the combat zone, the intensity of combat makes significant civilian casualties inevitable, even if Israel fully complies with the law of war. I also spoke this week to James Verini, a contributing writer to The Times Magazine, who wrote “They Will Have to Die Now: Mosul and the Fall of the Caliphate,” perhaps the definitive on-the-ground account of the fight for Mosul, and two things he said stood out in the conversation.
First, because precision weapons sometimes miss and intelligence often fails, airstrikes inevitably inflict serious collateral damage, including civilian casualties. Second, as the fight drags on and ramps up in intensity, concern for civilian lives often diminishes. That was the pattern for the less-disciplined Iraqi security forces, but we can’t for a moment presume that Israeli soldiers are superhuman. Most of them are draftees and reservists. They’re subject to the same fears and temptations under extreme stress and anger as any other soldier in any other army.
Then there’s the factor of time. Spencer observed that Israel always fights against the backdrop of a ticking clock. The United States is an independent economic and military superpower. We possess the world’s most powerful military and the world’s most potent economy. We have the luxury of fighting on timetables we set. If we want to slow down and take nine months to clear a city, we can take nine months to clear a city.
Israel possesses a powerful military and a strong economy, but it is still ultimately a dependent power. It cannot ignore international (and especially U.S.) pressure. In addition, calling hundreds of thousands of reservists out of the work force weakens the economy. In every major conflict since its war for independence, Israel has had to race to accomplish its military objectives before international pressure forced a cease-fire. The sheer scale of Hamas’s atrocities may increase the patience of the international community for an Israeli offensive, but that patience has never been unlimited.
Put all this together, and you can immediately perceive Israel’s asymmetric challenge. Hamas scorns the law of war. The reports of its intentional mass killing, mutilation, rape and civilian hostage taking are evidence enough of that fact. Israel legally and morally obligates the Israel Defense Forces to comply with the law. As a result, civilians become one of Hamas’s principal military assets. The presence of civilians gives Hamas the ability to punch first in any given street fight. The presence of civilians raises the bar for approving airstrikes or any other use of long-range weapons. And when civilians die, Hamas uses their deaths to inflame the international community and to help run out the clock on international patience for Israeli military operations.
Even worse, Hamas is helped by an enormous amount of public ignorance combined with outright misinformation. The average journalist — much less the average citizen — doesn’t know much, if anything, about the laws of war. Let’s take, for example, two key legal concepts that will be relevant every single day of the fighting in Gaza: proportionality and distinction.
As the war continues and as the destruction mounts, you will hear a number of voices condemn Israel for a disproportionate response, but many of these critics fundamentally misunderstand what proportionality means in the law of war. The U.S. Army’s “Law of Land Warfare” field manual — which is deeply grounded in the international law of armed conflict and governed our urban operations in Iraq and Afghanistan — defines the legal obligation of proportionality as requiring “commanders to refrain from attacks in which the expected loss or injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects incidental to such attacks would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage expected to be gained.” It also requires that commanders “take feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians, other protected persons and civilian objects.”
Proportionality does not require the Israel Defense Forces to respond with the same degree of force or take the same proportion of casualties as Hamas. In addition, as the manual states, “the proportionality standard does not require that no incidental harm results from attacks.” If you’re a soldier on patrol and someone fires at you with a rifle, you don’t have to respond with a rifle. You can use a tank round or a missile in response, unless you have reason to believe the tank round or missile will cause extraordinary collateral damage. But if you’re taking fire from a single house, proportionality prohibits you from destroying the entire block. Throughout the war on terrorism, American forces used powerful, longer-range weapons to attack individual targets. That does not violate the laws of war.
In reality, inflicting disproportionate casualties can be one of the goals of a fighting force. Ukraine appears to have inflicted substantially greater casualties on Russia than the Russian Army has inflicted on Ukraine. That doesn’t mean Ukraine’s response was disproportionate under the law of armed conflict. In every fight, the goal is to inflict as many losses as possible on your opponent while taking as few losses as possible.
There is a similar public ignorance problem with the concept of distinction, which “The Law of Land Warfare” defines as requiring combatants to distinguish “between combatants and military objectives on the one hand and civilians and civilian objects on the other in offense and defense.” Distinction requires soldiers to separate themselves from civilians by wearing uniforms, for example, or by fighting from marked military vehicles. It prohibits militaries from fighting from places like hospitals, schools and mosques.
Hamas disregards the principle of distinction. Its fighters take aim from civilian buildings while wearing civilian clothes and using civilian vehicles. This presents an attacking military with serious targeting problems. It is easy to identify, say, an armored personnel carrier as a military vehicle. But what if there are four Toyota Tacomas in the street and only one is full of Hamas fighters?
But here’s the key point: When Hamas abandons the principle of distinction, then Hamas is responsible for the civilian damage that results. If Hamas fights from a hospital — or stores munitions in a hospital — damage to that hospital is Hamas’s responsibility. If Hamas fighters shoot at Israel Defense Forces from a home that contains a Palestinian family, then Hamas is responsible for the civilian casualties if that family is harmed in the resulting exchange of fire.
There is also the unique military legal doctrine of siege warfare. On Monday, Israel announced a “complete siege” and said that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed inside the Gaza Strip. A siege is an ancient form of warfare, and the modern legal obligations of a besieging party are a matter of dispute, but again, “The Law of Land Warfare” is instructive. It explicitly declares it “lawful” to cut off “reinforcements, supplies and communications,” but it also states that the belligerents should “make reasonable, good-faith efforts to conclude local agreements for the removal of wounded, sick, infirm and aged persons, children and maternity cases from the besieged or encircled area.”
Given these realities, you can see the dynamic that will unfold. Bound by the laws of war, Israel has every incentive to decrease civilian casualties. The Israel Defense Forces are already providing detailed evacuation instructions for civilians to remove them from the zones of expected conflict. Netanyahu has urged residents to leave Gaza. Disregarding the law of war, Hamas has concrete tactical and strategic reasons to keep civilians in harm’s way and capitalize on their deaths.
To accurately describe that dynamic is not to pre-emptively excuse every single civilian death at the hands of the Israel Defense Forces. We are already seeing reports of significant civilian casualties from Israeli airstrikes, and it will be necessary to investigate them to ensure that the Israeli military followed proper protocols when approving those strikes. The siege will become legally and morally untenable if civilians cannot leave the besieged areas and if they’re blocked from receiving life-sustaining supplies. Egypt has responsibilities as well. If it continues to block entry into Sinai from Gaza, it will be contributing to the humanitarian crisis.
During the war on terrorism, the Army and Marines often embedded JAG officers (lawyers specifically trained in the law of armed conflict) with combat arms units to try to ensure compliance with the laws of war under circumstances every bit as difficult as the ones the Israel Defense Forces face in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces also rely heavily on their lawyers. When I served in Iraq with the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment, that was my job. Yet our military still made mistakes. Some American soldiers (not in my unit) committed war crimes, in spite of comprehensive training and numerous constraints placed on the use of force.
Every violation of the law should carry a consequence, but the law of war does not prevent Israel from destroying a terrorist army embedded in a civilian population. It can be done. It has been done. And as Israel embarks on perhaps its most difficult military operation since its war for independence, public clarity about the law of war will be indispensable for depriving Hamas of one of its chief propaganda weapons, and continued enforcement of the law of war can prevent atrocities that could fuel this conflict for generations to come.

Mohammed Abu Hatab is the latest journalist to die while covering the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more media workers than any other conflict in the area since 1992.
Mohammed Abu Hatab, a correspondent for a Palestinian television channel, and 11 members of his family were killed in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza on Thursday.
Palestine TV, where Mr. Abu Hatab worked and which is run by The Palestinian Authority, said they were killed at home by an Israeli airstrike. On Friday night, the Israeli military said that after a review, it was “not aware of any military activity conducted by our forces in the vicinity of the location in question.”
Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, said that Mr. Abu Hatab’s wife, son and brother were among the dead.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that more media workers have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war than in any other conflict in the area since it started tracking the data in 1992. As of Friday, 36 media workers — 31 Palestinians, four Israelis and one Lebanese — have been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, the group said.
Photographs showed people searching through the rubble of the home on Thursday and Friday, unearthing relics of the family’s everyday life. At Mr. Abu Hatab’s funeral on Friday, dozens of relatives, friends and fellow journalists wept and prayed above his shrouded body. Atop it rested a blue flak jacket and a microphone.
One of Mr. Abu Hatab’s colleagues at Palestine TV, Salman Al-Bashir, discussed his death on air on Thursday, in an emotional dispatch that the network also posted on social media. Speaking from the Nasser Hospital morgue, Mr. Al-Bashir removed his press vest and helmet, his voice breaking, as he lamented that not even protective gear — the flak jacket says “Press,” in blue capital letters — has kept journalists alive.
An initial investigation by Reporters Without Borders, a media watchdog group, that was released on Monday found that Issam Abdallah, a visual journalist for Reuters who was killed on Oct. 13, had been “targeted” by a strike that the group said came from the Israeli border. The Israeli army said it was reviewing the incident, adding that being near combat zones “comes with a severe risk to life.”
Last week, in a letter to the Reuters and Agence France-Presse news agencies, the Israeli military said that it could not guarantee the safety of reporters in Gaza because “Hamas has put its military operations in proximity to civilians and journalists.”
Journalists on the ground in Gaza covering the daily horrors of the war have had to confront the terrifying possibility of losing their lives or their families. Wael al-Dahdouh, the Gaza bureau chief of Al Jazeera’s Arabic-language service, learned while working that several members of his family had been killed, according to the news organization.
While reporting live from Gaza City on Oct. 25, Mr. al-Dahdouh was told that at least four members had been killed at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, where they had been sheltering, by what Al Jazeera’s parent company called an Israeli airstrike. He allowed Al Jazeera’s cameras to record him with some of their bodies in the morgue of a local hospital.

The Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, where Palestinian authorities say hundreds of people were killed by an explosion on Tuesday, has a long history in the region.
The hospital is in the southern part of Gaza City and has long operated amid conflict, contending with border clashes and financial and practical obstacles arising from the political situation. But since the war between Israel and Hamas began following the deaths of more than 1,400 people in Israel during Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the institution has found itself in the middle of a military operation and under fire.
On Saturday, rocket fire injured four staff members, according to the hospital, prompting the Most Rev. Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, to call for the reversal of Israel’s order for Palestinians to evacuate from the north of Gaza ahead of a planned ground offensive. “Hospitals and patients in Gaza are in grave danger,” he warned, adding that “they are facing catastrophe.”
After the blast on Tuesday, the archbishop said, “I mourn with our brothers and sisters — please pray for them,” in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
In addition to serving the sick, the hospital has also been serving as a shelter for Palestinians who have nowhere to go amid the chaos. After Israel called for Palestinians to evacuate the area, many civilians were sheltering at the hospital before it was hit.
The hospital is operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem, which also runs schools and clinics in the Palestinian territories, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. It was founded in 1882 by medical missionaries from the Church of England and currently operates under the authority of the Anglican Episcopal Church. 
Gaza’s population is mostly Muslim, as is Ahli Arab’s staff, and, despite the hospital’s Christian roots, it serves people of all faiths. In a 2018 interview with the Episcopal News Service, Suhaila Tarazi, the hospital’s director, said doctors and staff there are working “in the most difficult and gloomy situation.”
Now, that situation has become far more dire. In a statement on Tuesday, the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem condemned the strike on the hospital.
“Gaza remains bereft of safe havens,” the statement said.

The escalation laid bare the limitations of diplomatic deals between Israel and Arab governments as long as the underlying conflict continues. “We told you so,” a Saudi scholar said.
When the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco announced that they were establishing relations with Israel in 2020, Emirati officials said the deals were symbols of peace and tolerance, while then President Donald J. Trump declared “the dawn of a new Middle East.”
Those words rang hollow to many in the region, though. Even in the countries that signed the deals, branded the Abraham Accords, support for the Palestinians — and enmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of their land — remained strong, particularly as Israel’s government expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the agreements.
On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were celebrations — even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were killed and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel threatened a “long and difficult war” ahead.
“This is the first time that we rejoice in this way for our Palestinian brothers,” said Abdul Majeed Abdullah Hassan, 70, who joined a rally with hundreds of people in the island kingdom of Bahrain. In the context of the Israeli occupation and blockade, the Hamas operation “warmed our hearts,” he said, calling his government’s deal to recognize Israel “shameful.”
Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen, Tunisia and Kuwait. In Lebanon, Hashem Safieddine, head of the executive council for the Iran-backed militia Hezbollah, delivered a fiery speech lauding “the era of armed resistance.” And in Egypt’s coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian.
The ripples spreading from Gaza underscored what many officials, scholars and citizens in the region have been saying for years: The Palestinian cause is still a deeply felt rallying cry that shapes the contours of the Middle East, and Israel’s position in the region will remain unstable as long as its conflict with the Palestinians continues.
Diplomatic “normalization” agreements between Israel and Arab governments — even with the powerhouse of Saudi Arabia, where American officials have been pushing recently for normalization — will do little to change that, many regional analysts say.
“The current war is a stark reminder that lasting peace and prosperity in the region is only possible after resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” said Bader Al-Saif, a professor at Kuwait University. “No amount of heavy lifting or acrobatics in dealing with Israel on other files can sidestep or erase this simple fact.”
Many Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, have long insisted that the price of recognizing Israel must be the creation of a Palestinian state. But over the past decade, that calculus has shifted, as authoritarian leaders weigh negative public opinion toward a relationship with Israel against the economic and security benefits it could offer — and what they might be able to get from the United States in return.
The Biden administration has been pressing for a deal that would establish ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia in exchange for significant concessions to the kingdom. Saudi officials have demanded American security assurances and support for a civilian nuclear program. 
Last month, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia made his first public reference to the negotiations, saying in a Fox News interview that the talks felt “real” for the first time. And in early October, the kingdom’s newspapers — which operate under limited press freedom — began publishing a spate of columns that were subtly or openly supportive of normalization.
The eruption of violence on Saturday presented a significant challenge to those efforts.
It also made comments by King Abdullah II of Jordan at a conference in New York last month appear prescient: “This belief by some in the region that you can parachute over Palestine — deal with the Arabs and work your way back — that does not work,” he said.
Indeed, some Arab officials and scholars complain that their warnings about normalization deals that do not sincerely address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have fallen on deaf ears.
Watching the events in Gaza feels like hearing Arabs say “we told you so” to the American president, Khalid al-Dakhil, a prominent Saudi academic, wrote on the social media platform X. “Ignoring what’s right in finding a just solution to the Palestinian cause creates a trap for the region and threatens peace,” he said.
American officials say that normalization is a key step toward a more integrated Middle East, with positive implications for regional security and American defense interests.
“There are really two paths before the region,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “There’s the path of greater integration, greater stability, including, critically, making sure that Israelis and Palestinians resolve their differences, or there’s the path of terror that Hamas is engaged on, that has not improved the lives of a single person.”
He added: “We’ve said from day one that even as we’re working toward normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, that can’t be a substitute for resolving the differences between Israelis and Palestinians.”
But many in the region say that normalization feels like a betrayal: a triumph of government and business elites over the will of their people.
The Palestinian cause “is something we grew up on as children, and it became a compass to show what is right and just,” said Reem Maraj, 34, who participated in a symposium on Saturday in Bahrain that discussed the outcome of the Abraham Accords, three years later.
“If I had the choice, I would have erased this agreement from the history of my country,” she said.
Polls show that even in Arab countries that have relations with Israel, a majority of citizens view the Abraham Accords negatively.
“We stand fully with the rights of the Palestinian people to free their land,” said Hassan Bennajeh, one of the organizers of protests in Morocco. “We are asking to end the normalization because it doesn’t reflect the opinion of Moroccans.”
The Qatar Foreign Ministry released a statement saying that it holds Israel “solely responsible for the ongoing escalation due to its continuous violations of the rights of the Palestinian people.”
The government of Iran, which for years has been engaged in a shadow war with Israel and has supported Hamas, cheered the group’s attack on Israel on Saturday.
And Ahmed Abu Zeid, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, said on local television last night that his country “has been warning, for months, of the danger of provocative practices” by Israel.
“The ongoing occupation and dehumanization of Palestinians has been on full display for decades and it has shaped the way Arabs view the conflict,” said Mr. Al-Saif, the Kuwaiti professor. “Palestine is the priority of the Arab street.”
Even so, Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political scientist, predicted that a deal between Saudi Arabia, the United States and Israel was likely to move ahead.
“I would bet my money on it,” he said. “If the right price comes across from the Americans, I think the Saudis have their national interest as No. 1 priority.”
The violence in Israel “might derail things for a while, but it’s not going to reverse the appetite for normalization with Israel and de-escalating — a new Middle East,” he said.
On Sunday morning, another signal arrived in a major Saudi-owned newspaper, Asharq al-Awsat. In a column, Tariq Alhomayed, the newspaper’s former editor, criticized Hamas and Palestinian factions for waging what he called a “useless war.”
He accused them of trying to sabotage the prospects for Saudi-Israeli normalization — and of serving their Iranian backers at the expense of the Palestinian people.
“Iran does not want to see real peace, or specifically Saudi-Israeli peace,” he wrote. “Because if it happens, it will be the peace that will change the face of the region.”

With President Biden about to arrive in Israel, Palestinians and Israelis blamed each other for the explosion at a  hospital, where people had sought shelter from Israeli bombing.
An explosion killed hundreds of people on Tuesday at a hospital in Gaza City that was packed with people sheltering there, Gazan officials said, as Palestinians and Israelis blamed each other for a tragedy that inflamed the region just as President Biden was expected to arrive in Israel. 
  Hamas, the group that controls Gaza, said an Israeli airstrike had caused the blast at the Ahli Arab Hospital. Hours later, Israeli officials said that one of the rockets fired at Israel by Palestinian militants had failed shortly after launch, causing what could be the deadliest single incident of the 10-day-old war.
  Photos and videos posted online and verified by The New York Times showed bloodied and battered bodies, flames, grieving witnesses and the blankets, backpacks and mattresses of the dead and wounded littering the area around them. Ali Jadallah, a Palestinian photojournalist in Gaza City, said he watched as victims arrived at another hospital, ferried there in any available vehicle, most of them dead. Many of the bodies were not intact, he said.
  A woman shared a video she recorded as she made her way through the hospital, asking, ''Where am I supposed to go?''
  The images, as well as Hamas's immediate statements blaming Israel and the delay in Israeli denials, combined to fuel angry reactions across the Middle East, with large protests in Beirut and a crowd in Amman, Jordan, lighting a fire outside the Israeli embassy there.
  Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited authority over the West Bank, cut short a trip to Jordan, where he was scheduled to meet with Mr. Biden. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, which had been exploring establishing formal relations with Israel, blamed the massacre on ''the forces of the Israeli occupation.''
  The Israeli military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday night that the blast at the hospital had resulted from a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. Islamic Jihad denied the allegation.
  In the past, rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups, including Islamic Jihad, have occasionally malfunctioned and hit civilian neighborhoods.
  A spokeswoman for the Gazan health ministry put the toll at 500 or more dead, which the ministry later changed to ''hundreds.'' No figure could be confirmed independently, but images from the hospital, which is run by the Anglican Church, and witness accounts made clear that it was high.
  The disaster immediately raised the stakes for Mr. Biden, who is expected to arrive on Wednesday in Israel on a trip to meet with regional leaders in an attempt to de-escalate the crisis. He was scheduled to continue on to Amman to meet with the leaders of Jordan and Egypt, as well as Mr. Abbas, but that meeting was called off late Tuesday.
  Shortly before taking off for Israel on Air Force One, Mr. Biden said he was ''outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted.'' He said he had directed his national security team to look into what had happened.
  Israeli planes have been pummeling Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's Oct. 7 massacre and kidnapping of Israelis. The bombing campaign and Israel's directive to evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City, have displaced hundreds of thousands of people, killed or wounded thousands, and left people throughout the territory perilously low on water, food, fuel and medicine.
  People who fled their homes were sleeping in streets, fights were breaking out over food, and hospitals were increasingly unable to care for a flood of wounded patients. More than a week of international talks have yielded no agreement to allow vital supplies into the territory, to let some people exit, or to create safe zones for civilians within Gaza, where more than 2 million people are trapped in worsening conditions.
  Aid and human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the Israeli bombing and the instruction to evacuate. Israeli officials do not deny striking residential buildings and mosques, or killing and injuring noncombatants, but they insist that they are targeting Hamas's officials, weapons caches, tunnels and safe houses, all deeply intertwined with Gazan civilian infrastructure.
  Before the hospital explosion in Gaza City, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights's office in a statement on Tuesday cited ''daily indications of violations of the laws of war and international human rights law'' in Israel's campaign in Gaza, and said telling people to evacuate northern Gaza may be considered a forcible transfer of a population, itself a violation of international law.
  More than 600,000 people have fled northern Gaza -- over half the area's population -- the United Nations said on Tuesday, after Israel told Gazans to go south for their safety as it bombed and prepared for a possible ground invasion. But evacuation has been no guarantee of safety, with airstrikes killing people in the south and on the roads heading to it.
  Mohammad Ayoub, 57, and his family fled northern Gaza with only a few personal items, arriving in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, only to find it under attack, too. ''There's constant bombing, even in these areas they say are safe,'' Mr. Ayoub said. ''But there are no more safe places in Gaza.''
  The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it had stepped up bombing in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, in strikes that Gaza officials said killed 80 people overnight. Maj. Nir Dinar, a spokesman for the military, said Israel sought to avoid civilian casualties but that Hamas fighters were hiding among Palestinian civilians, and that southern Gaza -- while not entirely safe -- remained safer than the north.
  Hamas and Israel have gone to war several times before but never on this scale, and the conflict is a growing focus of international attention. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany went to Israel on Tuesday in a show of support for the country, and António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, is expected to go to the region on Thursday for meetings on the Israel-Gaza war.
  Mr. Biden has called the Hamas attack ''pure evil'' and said repeatedly that Israel has a right to respond in its defense, while also signaling concern about the human toll.
  Hamas's assault made Oct. 7 the deadliest single day in Israel's history, and it was the worst breach of the nation's security since the 1973 Yom Kippur war began with a surprise attack by Egypt, Syria and several other states. In a highly planned assault, thousands of Hamas militants broke through the border fence in multiple locations and poured into Israel, overrunning towns, military bases and a music festival, killing about 1,400 people -- mostly civilians, and a number of them visiting foreigners -- and taking about 200 hostages back to Gaza.
  Israel has retaliated for the attack with the most intense bombing campaign it has ever waged against Hamas, determined to wipe out the fighting ability of an organization dedicated to destroying Israel. Mr. Netanyahu declared last week that ''every Hamas member is a dead man.''
  The bombing had killed more than 2,800 people in Gaza, officials there said on Monday. The U.N. human rights commissioner's office said the dead have included at least 14 U.N. workers, 28 medical workers and 11 journalists. Gaza officials said that as many as 1,200 other people may still be under the rubble, as rescue workers struggle to find them.
  Late on Monday, Hamas released a video of a 21-year-old Israeli woman it was holding, and the video became a source of hope and anguish for her family and those of other hostages. The group has claimed that the Israeli bombing has killed a number of the hostages, along with the Hamas fighters holding them.
  A Hamas official said last week that the group would kill a hostage each time Israel bombed a home in Gaza, but there has been no sign that it has followed through on that threat.
  In southern Gaza, people are spending their days scrounging for food and water, and spending nights crammed with other families into small apartments, or sleeping in cars or on the pavement. Some of them say conditions are so dire they are considering returning to their homes in the north, despite the lethal risks. With internet and cellphone service breaking down under the bombing, they are finding it steadily harder to get information about where to go, or how to get there.
  ''Today is worse than all the previous bad days,'' Dr. Mohamed Zaqout, the general manager of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, said Tuesday. ''With many displaced from the north, more people share the same homes and thus there are more casualties in each strike.''
  The bombing has cut off most electricity, and emergency generators have run out of fuel at hospitals, shelters, water pumping stations and desalination plants. Hospitals ''have entered the stage of actual collapse due to power outages and fuel scarcity,'' the Gazan health ministry said in a statement.
  The World Health Organization warned that the water shortage and crowding would lead to unsanitary conditions, inviting outbreaks of disease.
  Gaza's only borders are with Israel and Egypt, which have imposed a partial blockade on the territory since Hamas took power there in 2007. Israel declared a ''complete siege'' after the Hamas incursion, sealing its border with Gaza and amassing troops and tanks along the boundary.
  That leaves the Rafah crossing into Egypt the only potential portal for people to escape -- including some 500 to 600 U.S. citizens and permanent residents -- and supplies to enter. But reports of imminent deals to open that door and let aid through have all proved unfounded.

Israel said it struck more than 400 targets in Gaza in its broadest single-day assault of the conflict. Palestinian officials said more than 700 were killed, the highest one-day toll of the war.
Escalating its onslaught against Hamas, Israel hit the Gaza Strip with hundreds of airstrikes in a single day, Israeli officials said Tuesday, and officials in Hamas-controlled Gaza said it was the deadliest day for Palestinians there since the conflict began.
It was not possible to independently verify the claims, but it was clear that even before Israeli soldiers have set foot in the Palestinian enclave to retaliate for Hamas’s Oct. 7 rampage in Israel, a humanitarian disaster in Gaza was growing worse by the day.
If a diplomatic solution is possible, there was little sign of it Tuesday at the United Nations, where diplomats spent the day issuing futile pleas for a ceasefire and bitter denunciations.
Israel’s foreign minister, Eli Cohen, began his address to the Security Council by holding up photos of Israeli children kidnapped when Hamas gunmen and allied militants streamed into towns and military bases, shooting mostly unarmed civilians and seizing hostages. “I have to remember and never let you forget,” he said.
In a scathing address of his own to the council, the Palestinian Authority’s minister of foreign affairs, Riyad al-Maliki, accused the international community of “selectivity and double standards.” Officials in Gaza say that 5,791 people there have been killed since Oct. 7.
“Doesn’t this wholesale killing offend you?” Mr. al-Maliki demanded. Officials of Egypt and Jordan accused Israel of violating international law in its conduct of the war.
The U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, tried to thread the needle. “The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas,” he said, “and those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”
Mr. Guterres did not emerge unscathed from the angry exchange, after he said that the attacks by Hamas, in which more than 1,400 people in Israel were slaughtered, “did not happen in a vacuum,” prompting the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations to demand his immediate resignation.
“It’s really unfathomable,” declared the ambassador, Gilad Erdan. “It’s truly sad that the head of an organization that arose after the Holocaust holds such horrible views.”
In Gaza, the situation appeared to be growing worse by the hour. “The situation is desperate,” the World Health Organization warned on Tuesday.
With Gaza’s power grid down and fuel for backup generators scarce, six hospitals there were forced to shut down, the W.H.O. said, and those that have managed to stay open are running out of supplies, their workers taking boxes off delivery trucks and straight into operating rooms.
Israel has tens of thousands of troops massed outside Gaza, waiting for orders to invade the territory, where some 200 Israelis seized in the Hamas raid are being held hostage. In the meantime, Israel has been pounding the enclave with airstrikes, more than 400 in the previous 24 hours alone, up from 320 a day earlier, its military said Tuesday.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the strikes of the last 24 hours had killed at least 704 people.
The Israeli government has been under pressure to delay a ground assault to allow desperately needed provisions to get to civilians in Gaza. The United States government has also urged Israel to slow down out of concern that it has no real plan for achieving its goal of defeating Hamas, which controls the territory, once and for all.
But on Tuesday, John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, made clear during a press briefing that the Biden administration does not support calls for a cease-fire. “A cease-fire right now really only benefits Hamas,” he said.
Israeli officials say they are using the air barrage to destroy Hamas installations, many of which are well concealed within — and beneath — residential neighborhoods and commercial districts, which have been devastated in the bombardment. But the challenges that poses became even clearer on Tuesday, a day after the militants released two women kidnapped in Israel.
Speaking to reporters at a hospital in Tel Aviv, one of the women, Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, described being marched through a network of subterranean tunnels under Gaza that she likened to “a spider web,” eventually arriving at a large room. In the first public account to emerge from any of the hostages, Ms. Lifshitz said she had been beaten by her kidnappers, but then had been treated relatively well in the tunnels.
About 20 of the hostages are believed to be children, and on Tuesday, family members pleaded with Hamas to release them. Some demonstrated outside U.N. headquarters in New York, while others have protested in front of Israel’s military headquarters in Tel Aviv.
Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, warned Israelis on Tuesday to gird themselves. “It could be a long war,” he said after meeting with the president of France, Emmanuel Macron.
For his part, the French leader offered both support — “You are not alone,” he declared — and a note of caution.
“The fight must be without mercy,” Mr. Macron said, “but not without rules. Because we are democracies that are fighting against terrorists, democracies that respect the laws of war, democracies that do not target civilians, in Gaza or elsewhere.”
Mr. Macron later traveled to the West Bank, where violence has surged in the last two weeks, to meet with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, and planned to head to Jordan on Wednesday to meet with King Abdullah II and possibly other regional leaders.
Concern remains high that the fighting between Israel and Hamas might set off a regional conflict that could be even harder to contain. Israeli forces have also been clashing with the militant group Hezbollah, which exercises de facto control over southern Lebanon; Hezbollah, like Hamas, is backed by Iran, an avowed enemy of Israel.
In Lebanon on Tuesday, the caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, met with U.N. peacekeeping forces and Lebanese troops stationed in the south of the country, calling for peace and denouncing Israel for “repeated attacks” on Lebanese soil, according to a statement.
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken and other U.S. officials said there might be a surge in attacks on American troops from Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria because of the Israel-Hamas war.
In Gaza, a densely populated enclave wedged between Israel, Egypt and the sea, basic life necessities remain in desperately short supply, but some aid has begun to get in.
Egypt has allowed 54 trucks through the Rafah crossing into Gaza to date, and among their loads were 477 tons of medical supplies, 291 tons of food and 87 tons of water, Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service, said at a news conference on Tuesday. An additional 250 trucks were waiting to cross.
Humanitarian groups have called for still more food, water and medicine to be sent in, as well as fuel — but Israel has balked at that last demand, because it says Hamas could use fuel for military purposes.
While Israel has cut off fuel shipments to Gaza, the Israeli military contends that Hamas has stockpiled an ample supply — and has refused to share it with hospitals.
There were hints that the Israel position might change, however. Asked whether Israel would allow fuel into the Gaza Strip, Herzi Halevi, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, appeared not to rule it out.
“Fuel?” he said. “We will ensure that it is where it needs to be to treat civilians. We will not allow fuel for Hamas so it can keep fighting the citizens of Israel.”
Hospitals in Gaza are paying a heavy price for the fuel shortages, with dozens of health centers out of commission, Palestinian officials said. A Health Ministry spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday that “the health care system has reached its worst stage in its history.”
The World Health Organization said that thousands of patients were at risk of complications or death as more shutdowns loom, including 1,000 people on dialysis, 130 premature babies and patients in intensive care or in need of surgery.

Also, House Republicans struggle to choose a leader. Here’s the latest at the end of Thursday.
Israel moved troops into position for a multipronged invasion of the Gaza Strip in an effort to dismantle Hamas, the militant group who massacred more than 1,200 Israelis in an attack over the weekend. 
No decision has been made yet about when or even whether to launch a ground war, officials insisted, but Israel has called up 360,000 reservists, sending many near the Gaza border.
That a major operation is coming is hardly in doubt, but there are tactical arguments over how one should start. And hanging over everything is the question of how long Israeli forces would stay. There is little appetite to reoccupy the Gaza Strip, Itamar Yaar, a former deputy head of Israel’s National Security Council, told The New York Times.
Six days of Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas have devastated parts of Gaza. The U.N. issued an official warning of “disaster” as hospitals ran short on fuel for generators and corridors were crammed with wounded people. More than 300,000 Palestinians in Gaza have lost their homes, and the Health Ministry said that 1,417 had been killed. The only power plant in the territory shut down yesterday.
Egypt said it would facilitate a humanitarian corridor to move urgently needed aid into Gaza, but officials there were adamantly opposed to allowing Gazans to enter the country, their only viable exit.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with leaders in Israel today, condemning Hamas’s “reign of terror” and promising American support while calling for “every possible precaution to prevent harming civilians.”
War scenes: The images streaming onto our phones from Israel and Gaza, many coming from those fighting or caught up in the war, don’t just document the story — they shape it.
House Republicans struggle to choose a leader
Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, may have narrowly won his party’s nomination for House speaker. But for the second consecutive day, Scalise found himself unable to scrounge together enough support to be elected on the House floor.
In fact, resistance to Scalise’s speakership appears to have grown. His detractors include lawmakers still loyal to former Speaker Kevin McCarthy and ultraconservatives who favor Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus.
In the meantime, legislative business remains halted. Here’s what can’t get done, including an aid package for Israel for its war against Hamas.
Inflation holds steady
Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent in the year through September. That matched the August reading, and was slightly higher than economists had predicted, suggesting that the Federal Reserve’s stated goal of bringing inflation back to 2 percent remains a long and bumpy road.
One notable aspect of today’s report: Housing continues to put pressure on consumer prices. Shelter prices accounted for more than 70 percent of the rise in core inflation last month.
For retirees, Social Security benefits will rise by 3.2 percent next year.
Senator Robert Menendez faces new charges
Robert Menendez, the Democratic senator from New Jersey who was charged last month with taking bribes in exchange for political favors, was indicted again today. Federal prosecutors accused him of conspiring to act as a foreign agent of Egypt even as he served as the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His wife, Nadine Menendez, was also charged, and prosecutors asked a judge to seize their residence in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.

TIME TO UNWIND
One of TV’s longest-lived characters is back
Almost 40 years after he was first introduced to viewers at the famous bar on “Cheers,” Frasier Crane is back on television. Kelsey Grammer reprises the role in a Paramount+ series, familiarly titled “Frasier,” premiering today. 
Several original cast members make guest appearances, and the show even returns with the formidable sitcom director James Burrows, but our critic James Poniewozik calls it a mediocre, anticlimactic reboot. “While this ‘Frasier’ has the occasional sentimental moment, it’s too busy re-creating the past to engage with the past,” he writes.
The art world is finally celebrating Judy Chicago
The pioneering feminist artist Judy Chicago was pushed to the industry’s sidelines for decades. But her message — that art by women can shake everything, all of us, to the core — has been gaining attention, and at 84, she is busier than ever.
The New Museum is exhibiting her first major New York survey. Spanning four floors, it includes a grounding show-within-a-show of more than 80 artists and thinkers, including Hilma af Klint, Georgia O’Keeffe and Frida Kahlo, giving their pieces and hers an imagined sisterhood.
Dinner table topics
Discreet fashion: Most people haven’t heard of Cristaseya. But it’s become the ultimate “if you know, you know,” luxury fashion line.
A.I. Obama: Fake audio generated by artificial intelligence has rapidly become a new weapon for online misinformation.
Irish country music: The singer known as CMAT has become a national star with songs that are irreverent, vulnerable, sad, smart — and decidedly strange.

ONE LAST THING
From bland to exclusive
For many years, whiskey connoisseurs have looked down on one of the distilling world’s most famous names: Jack Daniel’s. Its flagship bottle has been criticized as bland and unctuously sweet. But recently, the brand has quietly been remaking its image.
The distillery has begun rolling out a series of new, limited releases with the kind of characteristics that make whiskey hounds salivate — single-barrel bottling, high alcohol levels, heavily charred barrels. And the brand has converted a number of longtime skeptics. One collector we spoke to didn’t just add his first bottle of Jack Daniel’s, he added dozens.
Have a bracing evening.
Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. — Matthew

Hamas and Hamas-linked accounts are exploiting the challenge social media companies face in striking the right balance on moderation, experts say.
Hamas is barred from Facebook, removed from Instagram and run off TikTok. Yet posts supporting the group that carried out terrorist attacks in Israel this month are still reaching mass audiences on social networks, spreading gruesome footage and political messages to millions of people. 
  Several accounts sympathetic to Hamas have gained hundreds of thousands of followers across social platforms since the war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, according to a review by The New York Times.
  One account on Telegram, the popular messaging app that has little moderation, reached more than 1.3 million followers this week, up from about 340,000 before the attacks. That account, Gaza Now, is aligned with Hamas, according to the Atlantic Council, a research group focused on international relations.
  ''We've seen Hamas content on Telegram, like bodycam footage of terrorists shooting at Israeli soldiers,'' said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. ''We've seen images not just on Telegram but on the other platforms of bloodied and dead soldiers.''
  Such posts are the latest challenge for technology companies as many of them try to minimize the spread of false or extremist content while preserving content that does not run afoul of their rules. In past conflicts, like the genocide in Myanmar or other attacks between Palestinians and Israel, social media companies struggled to strike the right balance, with watchdog groups criticizing their responses for being too limited or sometimes overzealous.
  Experts said Hamas and Hamas-linked social media accounts were now exploiting those challenges to evade moderation and share their messages.
  Most online platforms have a long banned terrorist organizations and extremist content. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and X (formerly Twitter) have banned accounts linked to Hamas or posts that are overtly sympathetic to its cause, saying they violate their content policies against extremism.
  Gaza Now had more than 4.9 million followers on Facebook before it was banned last week, shortly after The Times contacted Meta, Facebook's parent company, about the account. Gaza Now did not post the kinds of gruesome content found on Telegram, but it did share accusations of wrongdoing against Israel and encouraged its Facebook followers to subscribe to its Telegram channel.
  Gaza Now also had more than 800,000 collective followers across other social media sites before many of those accounts were also removed last week. Its YouTube channel had 50,000 followers but had not updated since the conflict began. The account was suspended on Tuesday.
  In a statement, a spokesman for YouTube said Gaza Now violated the company's policies because the channel's owner had previously operated an account on YouTube that was terminated.
  Telegram has emerged as the clearest launching pad for pro-Hamas messaging, experts said. Accounts there have shared videos of captured prisoners, dead bodies and destroyed buildings, with followers often responding with the thumbs-up emoji. In one instance, users directed one another to upload gruesome footage of Israeli civilians being shot to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube. The comments also included suggestions on how to alter the footage to make it difficult for social media companies to easily find and remove it.
  Telegram also hosts an official account for Al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing. Its follower count has tripled since the conflict began.
  Pavel Durov, the chief executive of Telegram, wrote in a post last week that the company had removed ''millions of obviously harmful content from our public platform.'' But he indicated that the app would not bar Hamas outright, saying those accounts ''serve as a unique source of first-hand information for researchers, journalists, and fact-checkers.''
  ''While it would be easy for us to destroy this source of information, doing so risks exacerbating an already dire situation,'' Mr. Durov wrote.
  X, which Elon Musk owns, was overrun with falsehoods and extremist content almost as soon as the conflict began. Researchers at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which tracks hate and extremism online, found that in one 24-hour period, a collection of posts on X that supported terrorist activities received over 16 million views. The European Union said it would examine whether X violated a European law that required large social networks to stop the spread of harmful content. X did not respond to a request for comment.
  Yet accounts not directly claimed by Hamas present thornier challenges for social media companies, and users have criticized the platforms for being overzealous in removing pro-Palestinian content.
  Thousands of Palestinian supporters said Facebook and Instagram had suppressed or removed their posts, even when the messages did not break the platforms' rules. Others reported that Facebook had suppressed accounts that called for peaceful protests in cities around the United States, including planned sit-ins in the San Francisco area over the weekend.
  Meta said in a blog post on Friday that Facebook could have inadvertently removed some content as it worked to respond to a surge in reports of content that violated the site's policies. Some of those posts were hidden because of an accidental bug in Instagram's systems that was not showing pro-Palestinian content on its Stories feature, the company said.
  Masoud Abdulatti, a founder of a health care services company, MedicalHub, who lives in Amman, Jordan, said that Facebook and Instagram had blocked his posts supporting Palestinians, and that he had turned to LinkedIn to share support for civilians in Gaza who were trapped in the middle of the conflict.
  ''The people of the world are ignorant of the truth,'' Mr. Abdulatti said.
  Eman Belacy, a copywriter who lives in Sharkia governorate in Egypt, noted that she normally used her LinkedIn account only for business networking but had begun posting about the war after she felt that Facebook and Instagram were not showing the full picture of the devastation in Gaza.
  ''It might not be the place to share war news, but excuse us, the mount of injustice and hypocrisy are unbearable,'' Ms. Belacy said.
  The challenges reflect the blunt content moderation tools that social networks have increasingly relied on, said Kathleen Carley, a researcher and professor at the CyLab Security and Privacy Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.
  Many companies, she said, rely on a blend of human moderators -- who can be quickly overrun during a crisis -- and some computer algorithms, with no coordination between platforms.
  ''Unless you do content moderation consistently, for the same story across all the major platforms, you're just playing Whac-a-Mole,'' Ms. Carley said. ''It's going to resurface.''

The conflict is inflaming tensions across the region, where many of the problems that fueled uprisings and conflicts a decade ago remain unresolved.
Days after Palestinian gunmen from Gaza launched brazen attacks on southern Israel, killing more than 1,300 people in the broadest assault on the country in decades, the conflict is threatening to ripple across the Middle East.
In the Gaza Strip, while the Israeli military pummels the blockaded territory with airstrikes and demands that more than a million of its residents move south, Palestinians are hunkering down in fear. On Israel’s northern border, the army is clashing with a militant group in Lebanon. In Iraq and Yemen, armed groups have issued threats against Israel and the United States, its main ally. On Thursday, Israeli airstrikes hit the two main airports in neighboring Syria.
As Israel’s army prepares for a possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, the inferno flaring out from Gaza is turning into a potential nightmare for the entire region, threatening to destabilize not just Israel and the Palestinian territories, but also Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon.
American officials have doubled down on their support for Israel, with President Biden defending Israel’s “right to respond.”
Analysts say the outbreak of the war — and the Hamas attack that was deeper than anything Israel has experienced in decades — is not only a shock for officials in the Biden administration, who had recently been promoting their successes in soothing Middle East crises. It is also a major setback for the oil-rich powerhouses of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which had spent the past few years declaring their commitment to easing regional tensions and arguing that it was time to focus on domestic development.
Those hopes for relative calm have disintegrated, frightening officials, scholars and ordinary people across the region. The war in Israel comes on top of several conflicts that never fully died down, including in Yemen and Syria, and a new war that broke out this year in Sudan.
“We’re going backward,” said Mohammed Baharoon, head of B’huth, a Dubai-based research center. “Suddenly, it’s back to people killing people, and people cheering others for killing people.”
While the Gulf monarchies survived the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and the wars that followed — emerging wealthier and more powerful as neighboring countries collapsed — many of the underlying problems that fueled the revolts have intensified, including economic woes, corruption and political repression. That poses risks for the whole region, leaving many countries in a precarious position as this newest war unfolds, analysts say.
“Until political drivers of conflict, especially poor governance, start to be seriously addressed, it will be difficult for regional stability to take hold in a serious way,” said Anna Jacobs, senior Gulf analyst for the Crisis Group.
Saudi and Emirati officials have spent the past few years promoting what they described as a new approach, focused on economic diplomacy and de-escalating tensions.
In 2020, the Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco established diplomatic ties with Israel — reversing their stance of refusing to recognize the country before the creation of a Palestinian state. This year, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic ties with Iran, its regional rival. And, more recently, Saudi officials had been talking with American officials about a potential deal to form ties with Israel.
Now, leaders are struggling to salvage their plans in a flurry of calls and meetings. Qatar, Turkey and Egypt are working with the United States to try to contain the conflict to Israel and Hamas by talking to various parties, including Iran, an Arab official said.
If the conflict fully reaches Lebanon, or Iran is brought into it directly, it would be a catastrophe, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid disrupting the sensitive talks.
There are already signs of increased regional unrest.
Israel’s army has been clashing for several days with militants in Lebanon, home to Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Shiite group that is a sworn enemy of Israel.
In Iraq, more than 500,000 people filled Baghdad’s Tahrir Square on Friday in a show of support for the Palestinians. Called into the streets by the nationalist Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, people poured out of Baghdad’s mostly poorer neighborhoods to join together in a Friday Prayer that was strikingly disciplined and only occasionally punctuated by chants of “No, No to Israel” and “No, No to America.”
Protests also erupted on Friday in Jordan, Bahrain and Lebanon.
“Right now you’ve got a lot of countries in the region that have disaffected youth, bad economies, struggling people in general that are looking at this as a source of dignity,” said Mohammed Alyahya, a Saudi analyst and senior fellow at the Middle East Initiative at Harvard’s Belfer Center, referring to the assault by Hamas. “And that’s dangerous.”
Opinions across the vast region vary widely, with many ordinary people interviewed by The Times saying they were pained by the killing of Israeli civilians, particularly women and children, but saying that a degrading, colonial-style occupation by Israel has seeded Palestinian anger. Others saw the attacks against Israelis as a legitimate form of resistance.
In the Saudi capital of Riyadh, a teenager who had recently left his war-torn country of Yemen told a Times reporter on Wednesday that his “one and only wish in this life” was to travel to fight alongside Hamas.
“It’s a holy cause,” said Abdullah, 18, who asked to be identified by his first name only, to avoid government retribution.
Authoritarian governments that are wary of stoking a backlash have faced a challenging balancing act as they respond to the attacks, torn between pressure from Western allies to condemn them and their domestic public opinion. Regional entities with close ties to Iran — known as “the axis of resistance,” including Syria and armed groups in Lebanon and Iraq — have responded most loudly.
The Iraqi group Kataib Hezbollah said the Hamas attacks would “open the way for new strategic deterrence against the Zionist-American axis.” In Yemen, the leader of the Iran-backed Houthi fighters, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, said on Tuesday that if the United States intervened in Gaza, the Houthis would join the battle with missiles and drones.
The potential escalation in Gaza “returns us to the era of conflict and confrontation defined by the axis of resistance,” said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “It takes us back, not to the Arab Spring, but the pre-Arab Spring — 2007 or 2008.”
Chief among the region’s unresolved problems since then has been the Israeli-Palestinian conflict itself.
Azzam Tamimi, the author of a book about Hamas who has interviewed many of its leaders and members, said that before the attack on Saturday, Hamas was under growing pressure from its supporters to respond to what they saw as the marginalization of and increasing violence toward the Palestinians. 
“The world was ignoring the Palestinians,” he said.
On Thursday, the Israeli army chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, said that his forces would completely dismantle Hamas. “We will break them,” he said.  
But the history of Israel’s trying to stamp out Palestinian resistance with military action suggests that any such effort will not succeed, Mr. Tamimi said.
“Even if all of the people in Gaza are pushed out of the Strip and then Israel moves in and you have street battles and they try to liquidate as many fighters as possible, what will happen next?” he said. “Israel will continue for the Palestinians to be an invading power, an occupying power, and then there will be a new generation that will be more sophisticated.”
“There is no way forward other than recognizing Palestinian rights,” he said. 
The United States response has disturbed many in the Middle East.
This week, Mr. Biden said, “We stand with Israel.” And in Israel on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said he could only speculate about the goals of Hamas in carrying out its attacks. “The simplest explanation may be the most compelling — this is pure evil,” he said.
“This war has demonstrated the sweeping tendency of Western countries to support Israel at every turn,” the Saudi novelist Abdo Khal wrote in a column in the Okaz newspaper on Thursday. “Because the results of this war are known in advance, the Gaza Strip will be blown into smithereens: stones, trees, and people.”
Nearly 1,800 Palestinians have been killed and over 6,600 others injured since Israel began retaliating for the Hamas attacks on Saturday.
To many people watching aghast from around the region, the Hamas attacks laid bare the risks of allowing the Palestinians to remain in hopelessness, Mr. Baharoon, the head of the Dubai research center, and several other scholars said.
“There is no state to be seen — their land is shrinking; their rights are shrinking,” he said, pointing out how deprivation can fuel unrest and violence. “Despair can be a very important weapon.”

U.S. officials learned that the Israeli defense minister and other military officials supported a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been cautious.
President Biden and his top aides have been urging Israeli leaders against carrying out any major strike against Hezbollah, the powerful militia in Lebanon, that could draw it into the Israel-Hamas war, American and Israeli officials say. 
  The U.S. officials are concerned that some of the more hawkish members of Israel's war cabinet have wanted to take on Hezbollah even as Israel begins a long conflict against Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks. The Americans are conveying to the Israelis the difficulties of battling both Hamas in the south and a much more powerful Hezbollah force in the north.
  U.S. officials believe Israel would struggle in a two-front war and that such a conflict could draw in both the United States and Iran, the militia's main supporter.
  The effort by top American officials to head off an Israeli offensive on Hezbollah, reported in detail here for the first time, reveals anxieties by the Biden administration over the war planning of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his aides, even as the two governments strive to present a strong united front in public.
  American officials want to rein in Hezbollah too. In numerous meetings across the Middle East, American diplomats have been urging their Arab counterparts to help pass messages to the militia, including via their contacts in Iran, to try to prevent any Israel-Hezbollah war from erupting, whether through actions by the militia group or by the Israelis.
  U.S. officials feared that Mr. Netanyahu might approve a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah in the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, which killed more than 1,400 people. Although those fears have receded for now because Mr. Netanyahu cooled to the idea, anxieties still persist over two possibilities: an Israeli overreaction to Hezbollah rocket attacks, and harsh Israeli tactics in an expected ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza that would compel Hezbollah to enter the war.
  American officials have advised Israeli counterparts in meetings this week to take care that their actions in the north against Hezbollah and in the south in Gaza do not give Hezbollah an easy pretext to enter the war. Those sensitive talks took place during Mr. Biden's visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday and during Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken's long negotiations in Israel earlier this week.
  In both visits, the American officials met with Mr. Netanyahu and his war cabinet, almost unheard of in Israel's history. They avoided using blunt language to warn the Israelis away from provocative military actions because they understood the vulnerability felt by Israeli officials after the Oct. 7 attacks. But both Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken made their concerns clear, said U.S. and Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about diplomatic discussions during wartime.
  One of the biggest champions of a pre-emptive attack on Hezbollah has been Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, who has argued Israel's main military effort should be focused on Hezbollah since it poses a greater threat than Hamas, the officials said.
  Mr. Gallant told Mr. Blinken in a small meeting on Monday that he had advocated the previous week to launch a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah, but was overruled by other officials, said a person familiar with the discussion.
  Mr. Biden met on Wednesday with the Israeli war cabinet, where Mr. Gallant was present, and underscored the dangers of a two-front war by asking tough questions about the many consequences for Israel of a full-scale conflict with Hezbollah, officials said. Mr. Biden also raised the specters of the disastrous decisions by American officials to invade Iraq and to wage a long, open-ended war in Afghanistan.
  The White House National Security Council and the State Department declined to comment for this story. The Israeli military and Mr. Gallant also declined to comment.
  A representative of Mr. Netanyahu's office issued a statement that said, ''Israel is united in the war against Hamas. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that if Hezbollah joins the war, they will make a grave mistake and will pay a devastating price unlike any before.''
  From Oct. 12 to Oct. 18, over the week of Mr. Blinken's marathon Middle East crisis trip and Mr. Biden's visit to Tel Aviv, the Biden administration evolved in how it conveyed its concerns to Israel -- eventually deciding to couch them in lessons learned from America's costly overreaction to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
  At a news conference in Tel Aviv on Oct. 12, Mr. Blinken avoided directly answering a question from an American reporter on whether he had any lessons to impart to Israel from the response to Sept. 11. But by Oct. 18, he and Mr. Biden were talking about the U.S. mistakes in private to the Israelis, and Mr. Biden was openly pointing to them in a speech in Tel Aviv.
  For now, Mr. Netanyahu has refrained from backing a major attack on Hezbollah, despite the encouragement of Mr. Gallant and senior military generals, U.S. and Israeli officials said. And the Israeli military has so far not reacted with overwhelming force to the ongoing low-level rocket fire from Hezbollah. But the fast-moving events of the war could change that.
  American and Israeli officials say they have not found evidence yet that Hezbollah or Iran played a role in the planning of the Hamas attacks. Several senior Hezbollah and Iranian officials appeared to have been surprised by the attacks, U.S. and Israeli officials have said. U.S. and allied officials have also said they had assessed for years that Hezbollah leaders have sought to avoid all-out war with Israel.
  The C.I.A. has long assessed that Israel would face significant challenges in a war against both Hezbollah and Hamas, say officials familiar with the intelligence. Recent work includes analysis that the deep divisions in Israel over Mr. Netanyahu's proposed changes to the judiciary had left the Israeli army weaker, the officials said.
  White House officials first became worried over the prospect of a widening war when, soon after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, they heard of a debate among Israeli officials over pre-emptively striking Hezbollah and focusing the country's main combat effort on that group. The White House officials told the Israelis it was a bad idea.
  In the internal Israeli debate, Mr. Netanyahu had expressed some support for the strike, Israeli officials said. Some Israeli military officials came up with a plan that focused on attacking Hezbollah, by using the pretense of an invasion of Gaza as cover for a bigger assault in the north, they said. Mr. Netanyahu held off on enacting the plan, to the disappointment of Mr. Gallant, a former naval special forces commander, and other supporters of the plan, the officials said.
  By the time Mr. Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv for his first wartime visit, on Oct. 12, the American officials had become less anxious about such a strike, but were still concerned over potential Israeli overreaction to the ongoing Hezbollah rocket attacks.
  Hezbollah has been firing rockets into northern Israel since Israel's war with Hamas began, prompting Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire in south Lebanon, but the group has so far refrained from carrying out a major attack. Since Israel and Hezbollah last fought a war, in 2006, the group has grown stronger and better armed, with an estimated 100,000 rockets and missiles in its arsenal, Israeli officials say. Hezbollah also has many fighters who have honed their skills battling the Islamic State in Syria.
  The Biden administration is also carrying out a parallel diplomatic and military deterrence campaign to try to prevent Hezbollah from going to war against Israel. If that happened, Iran could decide to enter the fray, making the conflict a regional one, even though U.S. officials assess that Iran for now does not want to get into such a war.
  Mr. Blinken and his colleagues have been passing messages to Iran and Hezbollah through Qatar, China and other nations to tell those adversaries of Israel to stay out of the Hamas war. The Pentagon has sent two aircraft carriers to the eastern Mediterranean and has increased troops in the area as a deterrence measure.
  The debate among Israeli officials about whether to attack Hezbollah has echoes of the Bush administration drive to invade Iraq after the Sept. 11 attacks, even as it was still waging war in Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda, the terrorist group that carried out those attacks, was based.
  Mr. Biden had three notable lines in his speech in Tel Aviv that referred to ''mistakes'' by the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks.
  ''I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it,'' Mr. Biden said. ''After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.''
  Right before Mr. Biden's visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday, Victoria Nuland, the third-ranking State Department official, and other senior diplomats told a small group of U.S. lawmakers that the Biden administration was worried about the possibility of Israel widening the war by doing a major strike on Hezbollah and other armed groups, said an official with knowledge of the briefing. The diplomats said they were concerned that some Israeli officials, including Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gallant, were blind with rage from the atrocities committed by Hamas fighters during the attack on Oct. 7, the official said.
  The diplomats told the lawmakers this was one reason that Mr. Blinken's meeting with Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet, which began Monday night, dragged on for seven and a half hours into Tuesday morning. 
  After the Oct. 7 attacks, Mr. Gallant announced a ''complete siege of Gaza,'' cutting off water, electricity and food, going far beyond the naval blockade it has imposed for 16 years. ''We are fighting human animals,'' he said. Israel's bombardment following the Hamas attacks has resulted in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians and the displacement of more than one million people. Israel ordered all of Gaza's northern residents to head south ahead of an expected ground invasion. But Israel has since bombed the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah.
  After Mr. Gallant and Mr. Blinken had their Monday meeting, the two were supposed to pose silently on a stage for photographs for journalists. But Mr. Gallant surprised American diplomats with public remarks in which he praised the presence of U.S. warships in the Mediterranean -- which could end up involved in a full-blown Israel-Hezbollah conflict -- and said, ''This will be a long war; the price will be high.''

It was 3 a.m. on Oct. 7, and Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's domestic security service, still could not determine if what he was seeing was just another Hamas military exercise.
At the headquarters of his service, Shin Bet, officials had spent hours monitoring Hamas activity in the Gaza Strip, which was unusually active for the middle of the night. Israeli intelligence and national security officials, who had convinced themselves that Hamas had no interest in going to war, initially assumed it was just a nighttime exercise. 
  Their judgment that night might have been different had they been listening to traffic on the hand-held radios of Hamas militants. But Unit 8200, Israel's signals intelligence agency, had stopped eavesdropping on those networks a year earlier because they saw it as a waste of effort.
  As time passed that night, Mr. Bar thought that Hamas might attempt a small-scale assault. He discussed his concerns with Israel's top generals and ordered the ''Tequila'' team -- a group of elite counterterrorism forces -- to deploy to Israel's southern border.
  Until nearly the start of the attack, nobody believed the situation was serious enough to wake up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to three Israeli defense officials.
  Within hours, the Tequila troops were embroiled in a battle with thousands of Hamas gunmen who penetrated Israel's vaunted border fence, sped in trucks and on motorbikes into southern Israel and attacked villages and military bases.
  The most powerful military force in the Middle East had not only completely underestimated the magnitude of the attack, it had totally failed in its intelligence-gathering efforts, mostly due to hubris and the mistaken assumption that Hamas was a threat contained.
  Despite Israel's sophisticated technological prowess in espionage, Hamas gunmen had undergone extensive training for the assault, virtually undetected for at least a year. The fighters, who were divided into different units with specific goals, had meticulous information on Israel's military bases and the layout of kibbutzim.
  The country's once invincible sense of security was shattered.
  More than 1,400 people were killed, including many women, children and old people who were murdered systematically and brutally. Hundreds are held hostage or are still missing. Israel has responded with a ferocious bombardment campaign on Gaza, killing more than 8,000 Palestinians and wounding thousands more, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military on Sunday signaled a heavier assault on Gaza, saying it had expanded its ground incursion overnight.
  Israeli officials have promised a full investigation into what went wrong.
  Even before that inquiry, it is clear the attacks were possible because of a cascade of failures over recent years -- not hours, days or weeks. A New York Times examination, based on dozens of interviews with Israeli, Arab, European and American officials, as well as a review of Israeli government documents and evidence collected since the Oct. 7 raid, shows that:
  Israeli security officials spent months trying to warn Mr. Netanyahu that the political turmoil caused by his domestic policies was weakening the country's security and emboldening Israel's enemies. The prime minister continued to push those policies. On one day in July he even refused to meet a senior general who came to deliver a threat warning based on classified intelligence, according to Israeli officials.
  Israeli officials misjudged the threat posed by Hamas for years, and more critically in the run-up to the attack. The official assessment of Israeli military intelligence and the National Security Council since May 2021 was that Hamas had no interest in launching an attack from Gaza that might invite a devastating response from Israel, according to five people familiar with the assessments who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details. Instead, Israeli intelligence assessed that Hamas was trying to foment violence against Israelis in the West Bank, which is controlled by its rival, the Palestinian Authority.
  The belief by Mr. Netanyahu and top Israeli security officials that Iran and Hezbollah, its most powerful proxy force, presented the gravest threat to Israel diverted attention and resources away from countering Hamas. In late September, senior Israeli officials told The Times they were concerned that Israel might be attacked in the coming weeks or months on several fronts by Iran-backed militia groups, but made no mention of Hamas initiating a war with Israel from the Gaza Strip.
  American spy agencies in recent years had largely stopped collecting intelligence on Hamas and its plans, believing the group was a regional threat that Israel was managing.
  Overall, arrogance among Israeli political and security officials convinced them that the country's military and technological superiority to Hamas would keep the terrorist group in check.
  ''They were able to trick our collection, our analysis, our conclusions and our strategic understanding,'' Eyal Hulata, Israel's national security adviser from 2021 until early this year, said during a discussion last week in Washington sponsored by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank.
  ''I don't think there was anyone who was involved with affairs with Gaza that shouldn't ask themselves how and where they were also part of this massive failure,'' he added.
  Many senior officials have accepted responsibility, but Mr. Netanyahu has not. At 1 a.m. Sunday in Israel, after his office was asked for comment on this article, he posted a message on X, formerly Twitter, that repeated remarks he made to The New York Times and blamed the military and intelligence services for failing to provide him with any warning on Hamas.
  ''Under no circumstances and at no stage was Prime Minister Netanyahu warned of war intentions on the part of Hamas,'' the post read in Hebrew. ''On the contrary, the assessment of the entire security echelon, including the head of military intelligence and the head of Shin Bet, was that Hamas was deterred and was seeking an arrangement.''
  In the resulting furor, Benny Gantz, a member of his war cabinet, publicly rebuked Mr. Netanyahu, saying that ''leadership means displaying responsibility,'' and urged the prime minister to retract the post. It was later deleted, and Mr. Netanyahu apologized in a new one.
  On Sunday, Shin Bet promised a thorough investigation after the war. The I.D.F. declined to comment.
  The last time Israelis' collective belief in their country's security was similarly devastated was 50 years earlier, at the start of the Yom Kippur War, when Israel was caught off guard by an assault by Egyptian and Syrian forces. In an echo of that attack, Hamas succeeded because Israeli officials made many of the same mistakes that were made in 1973.
  The Yom Kippur War was ''a classic example of how intelligence fails when the policy and intelligence communities build a feedback loop that reinforces their prejudices and blinds them to changes in the threat environment,'' Bruce Riedel, a former top Middle East analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, wrote in a 2017 research paper about the 1973 war.
  In an interview this month, Mr. Riedel said that Mr. Netanyahu was reaping the consequences of focusing on Iran as the existential threat to Israel while largely ignoring an enemy in his backyard.
  ''Bibi's message to Israelis has been that the real threat is Iran,'' he said, using Mr. Netanyahu's nickname. ''That with the occupation of the West Bank and the siege of Gaza, the Palestinian issue is no longer a threat to Israel's security. All of those assumptions were shattered on Oct. 7.''
  Ignored Warnings
  On July 24, two senior Israeli generals arrived at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, to deliver urgent warnings to Israeli lawmakers, according to three Israeli defense officials.
  The Knesset was scheduled that day to give final approval to one of Mr. Netanyahu's attempts to curb the power of Israel's judiciary -- an effort that had convulsed Israeli society, ignited massive street protests and led to large-scale resignations from the military reserves.
  A growing portion of the Air Force's operational pilots was threatening to refuse to report to duty if the legislation passed.
  In the briefcase of one of the generals, Aharon Haliva, the head of the Israeli Defense Forces' Military Intelligence Directorate, were highly classified documents detailing a judgment by intelligence officials that the political turmoil was emboldening Israel's enemies. One document stated that the leaders of what Israeli officials call the ''axis of resistance'' -- Iran, Syria, Hamas, Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad -- believed this was a moment of Israeli weakness and a time to strike.
  Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, according to one of the documents, said that it was necessary to prepare for a major war.
  General Haliva was ready to tell the coalition leaders that the political turmoil was creating an opportunity for Israel's enemies to attack, particularly if there were more resignations in the military. Only two members of the Knesset came to hear his briefing.
  The legislation passed overwhelmingly.
  Separately, Gen. Herzi Halevi, the military's chief of staff, tried to deliver the same warnings to Mr. Netanyahu. The prime minister refused to meet him, the officials said. Mr. Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment about this meeting.
  The generals' warnings were in large part based on a series of provocations on Israel's northern border.
  In February and March, Hezbollah had sent explosive-laden drones toward Israeli gas rigs. In March, a militant climbed over the border fence from Lebanon into Israel, carrying several powerful bombs, weapons, phones and an electric bike on which he traveled to a major northern intersection. He then used a powerful charge, apparently trying to blow up a bus.
  On May 21, Hezbollah staged for apparently the first time war games at one of its training sites in Aaramta in south Lebanon. Hezbollah launched rockets and flew drones that dropped explosives on a simulated Israeli settlement.
  Israeli officials believed that Hezbollah was leading the planning for a coordinated attack against Israel, but not one that would prompt an all-out war.
  The officials' concerns grew through August and September, and General Halevi went public with his concerns.
  ''We must be more prepared than ever for a multi-arena and extensive military conflict,'' he said at a military ceremony on Sept. 11, just weeks before the attack.
  Mr. Netanyahu's allies went on Israeli television and condemned General Halevi for sowing panic.
  In a series of meetings, Shin Bet gave similar warnings to senior Israeli officials as General Halevi. Eventually, Mr. Bar also went public.
  ''From the investigations we are doing we can say today that the political instability and the growing division are a shot of encouragement to the countries of the axis of evil, the terrorist organizations and the individual threats,'' Mr. Bar said in a speech.
  Mr. Netanyahu's government also ignored warnings from Israel's neighbors. As the custodian of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, Jordan has traditionally been an important mediator between Palestinians and Israel's government on the Aqsa Mosque compound, the third most holy site in Islam. The mosque compound has seen repeated raids by Israeli forces over the years, and Hamas has said that it launched this month's attack in part as retaliation for those acts.
  But Jordan found that when Mr. Netanyahu formed a government late last year, the most far right in recent history, it was less receptive to their warnings that the incidents at the Aqsa Mosque compound was stirring up sentiment inside Palestinian territories that could boil over into violence, according to two Arab officials with knowledge of the relationship.
  The Wrong Focus
  While security and intelligence officials were right about a coming attack, their intense focus on Hezbollah and Iran had a tragic effect: Far less attention was paid to the threats from Gaza. Since Israel's withdrawal in 2005 and Hamas's evolution from a purely guerrilla organization into the governing power of Gaza in 2007, Hamas had only periodic skirmishes with the Israeli military.
  Under four different prime ministers, Israel repeatedly decided that reoccupying Gaza and crushing Hamas would cost too many lives and do too much damage to Israel's international reputation.
  Israel knew that Hamas, which Iran supports with funding, training and weapons, was growing stronger over time. But officials thought they could contain Hamas with an extensive network of human spies, sophisticated surveillance tools that would deliver early warnings of an attack and border fortifications to deter a Hamas ground assault. They also relied on the Iron Dome air defense system for intercepting rockets and missiles launched from Gaza.
  The strategy, confirmed by multiple Israeli officials, bore some fruit. Over the years, Israel's investment in penetrating Hamas's inner circle in Gaza allowed Israel to uncover the group's attack plans and occasionally led to assassinations of Hamas leaders.
  Strengthening Hamas
  Publicly, Mr. Netanyahu used blunt rhetoric about Hamas. His election slogan in 2008 was ''Strong Against Hamas,'' and in one campaign video at the time he pledged: ''We will not stop the I.D.F. We will finish the job. We will topple the terror regime of Hamas.''
  Over time, however, he came to see Hamas as a way to balance power against the Palestinian Authority, which has administrative control over the West Bank and has long sought a peace agreement in Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state.
  Mr. Netanyahu told aides over the years that a feeble Palestinian Authority lowered the pressure on him to make concessions to Palestinians in negotiations, according to several former Israeli officials and people close to Mr. Netanyahu. An official in Mr. Netanyahu's office, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, denied this had been the prime minister's policy.
  But there is no question that Israeli officials viewed Hamas as a regional threat, not a global terrorist organization like Hezbollah or the Islamic State. This view was shared in Washington, and American intelligence agencies dedicated few resources to collecting information on the group.
  Some parts of the American government even believed that Hamas operatives could be recruited as sources of information about terrorist groups considered more urgent priorities in Washington.
  Jonathan Schanzer, a former Treasury Department official and now the senior vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, recalled a meeting he had in 2015 with American intelligence and law enforcement officials about suspected Hamas operatives inside the United States.
  During the meeting, he recalled, the officials told him they were trying to turn the Hamas operatives into ''assets'' in the fight against the Islamic State.
  The Invincibility of the Wall
  Israeli officials firmly believed that ''The Barrier'' -- a nearly 40-mile-long reinforced concrete wall above and below ground, completed in 2021 -- would hermetically seal off Gaza. There was also a surveillance system at the border based almost exclusively on cameras, sensors and remote-operated ''sight-shooter'' systems, four senior Israeli military officers told The Times.
  Senior Israeli military officials believed that the combination of remote surveillance and machine-gun systems with the formidable wall would make it almost impossible to infiltrate Israel, and thus reduce the need for a large number of soldiers to be stationed at the bases.
  But Hamas's attack exposed the fragility of that technology. The group used explosive drones that damaged the cellular antennas and the remote firing systems that protected the fence between Gaza and Israel.
  To get around Israel's powerful surveillance technology, Hamas fighters also appeared to enforce strict discipline among the group's ranks to not discuss its activities on mobile phones. This allowed them to pull off the attack without detection, one European official said.
  The group most likely divided its fighters into smaller cells, each probably only trained for a specific objective. That way, the rank and file did not understand the scale of the attacks they were preparing for and could not give away the operation if caught, a European official said, based on his analysis of how the attack unfolded and from the videos the group disseminated from the operation.
  Hamas may have learned such operational discipline from Hezbollah, which has long confused Israeli forces on the battlefield by dividing its fighters into smaller units of friends or relatives, according to Lebanese officials with ties to the group. If the fighters speak openly on cellphones to coordinate military operations, Lebanese officials with ties to the group said, part of their code is to speak in childhood memories -- for example, asking to meet up in a field where they once played together.
  Hamas claimed that 35 drones took part in the opening strike, including the Zawari, an explosive-laden drone.
  ''We started receiving messages that there was a raid on every reporting line,'' testified one soldier, who was at the Gaza Division base on the day of the invasion, in a conversation with the ''Hamakom Hachi Ham Bagehinom'' (''The Hottest Place in Hell'') website.
  ''On every reporting line, swarms of terrorists were coming in,'' the soldier added. ''The forces did not have time to come and stop it. There were swarms of terrorists, something psychotic, and we were simply told that our only choice was to take our feet and flee for our lives.''
  In a conversation with military investigators two weeks after the attack, soldiers who survived the assault testified that the Hamas training was so precise that they damaged a row of cameras and communication systems so that ''all our screens turned off in almost the exact same second.'' The result of all this was a near total blindness on the morning of the attack.
  After the fighting had stopped, Israeli soldiers found hand-held radios on the dead bodies of some of the Hamas militants -- the same radios that Israeli intelligence officials had decided a year ago were no longer worth monitoring.

The fast-moving events highlighted the difficulty of covering the war between Israel and Hamas.
The shifting coverage about a deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza highlighted the difficulties of reporting on a fast-moving war in which few journalists remain on the ground while claims fly freely on social media. 
  The first reports of a strike at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City came early Tuesday afternoon Eastern time. A spokeswoman for the Gaza health ministry said an Israeli airstrike had caused the explosion, killing at least 200 people. In a televised interview, a health ministry spokesman later said the death toll exceeded 500 -- which the ministry later changed to ''hundreds.''
  The news changed quickly over a couple of hours. Many Western news organizations, including The New York Times, reported the Gazan claims in prominent headlines and articles. They adjusted the coverage after the Israeli military issued a statement urging ''caution'' about the Gazan allegation. The news organizations then reported the Israeli military's assertion that the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas.
  On Wednesday, American officials agreed with Israel, saying early intelligence indicated that the launch did not come from Israel and instead was caused by the armed Palestinian group. Most of the coverage about the blast on Wednesday focused on the U.S. analysis.
  But many supporters of each side had already made up their minds in the ensuing hours. Much of the Arab world united in support of Palestinians, with thousands of protesters marching in cities across the Middle East on Tuesday night and Wednesday, blaming Israel for the deaths of civilians at the hospital.
  Kathleen Carroll, a former executive editor of The Associated Press, said the situation in Gaza was tough for news organizations to handle because they could not always get firsthand or verified accounts. As Israel prepares for a ground assault in Gaza, most Western journalists have evacuated the area, and reporters that remain face shellings and shortages of water, food and electricity.
  The Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday that at least 19 journalists had been killed during the conflict, 15 of them Palestinian.
  ''It's extremely difficult,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''In Gaza, there are so few news organizations able to be on the ground and getting the kind of eyewitness reporting that helps.''
  Covering wars is always fraught, both because journalists on the ground are often in harm's way and because the sides at war aggressively push information in their favor.
  The war between Israel and Hamas has proved even more difficult than most conflicts, because it has generated vast amounts of misleading and false information online. There are so many untrue claims that some people question the true ones.
  It takes time to independently verify the claims from all sides. In the separate conflict between Russia and Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine initially blamed Russia for a deadly missile strike on Sept. 6 in eastern Ukraine. But a New York Times investigation, published 12 days later, found that an errant Ukrainian air defense missile was most likely the cause. The investigation relied on combing through satellite imagery, missile fragments, witness accounts and social media posts.
  The coverage of this week's hospital blast generally represented what had been said about the explosion at the time of publication. The BBC's initial breaking news report said, ''Hundreds feared dead or injured in Israeli airstrike on hospital in Gaza, Palestinian officials say.'' A later headline was ''Israel denies airstrike on hospital in Gaza, saying failed militant rocket to blame.''
  The Times sent a news alert at 2:51 p.m. Eastern time carrying the Palestinian assertion of an Israeli missile strike on the hospital. When the Israeli military statement came out, The Times sent another news alert on Israel's assertion that ''a misfired Palestinian rocket'' was to blame.
  Not all large global news outlets made similar changes. Al Jazeera, the news organization funded by the Qatari government, continued to report on Tuesday evening that Israel was to blame for the attack. It included a blog post with Israel's denial, but added a comment from one of its own reporters, who said Israel regularly deflected blame for attacks that killed civilians on misfiring rockets. On Wednesday, Al Jazeera continued to report that the blast was an ''Israeli attack.''
  The BBC and Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Times spokesman said, ''We report what we know as we learn it.''
  ''We apply rigor and care to what we publish, explicitly citing sources and noting when a piece of news is breaking and likely to be updated,'' he said.
  Bill Grueskin, a professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, said media organizations had to be ''exceptionally careful'' in dealing with news around the Israel-Hamas conflict, and should be transparent about where they are getting their information, ''particularly when it's from official channels that have vested interests in promulgating a particular point of view.''
  Ms. Carroll echoed that sentiment, and said news organizations had to refrain from trying to fill in knowledge gaps with speculation.
  ''There's so much mistrust on all sides and in all directions,'' Ms. Carroll said. ''It's incredibly hard to walk that line, practically impossible to present a news story in whatever format that's going to be believed by all parties.''

Highlight: Hamas’ deadly surprise attack and Israel’s response have set off a humanitarian, diplomatic and military crisis and left the United States and its allies scrambling to keep it from spiraling into a wider conflict
Body


It has been more than two weeks since Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza, launched a terrorist attack that killed 1,400 Israelis. Since then, the Hamas-run health ministry has said that more than 5,000 people have died in retaliatory strikes by Israel. It has not been possible to independently verify the death toll in Gaza.
Here is what we know about some of the most pressing issues raised by the war and the complex negotiations taking place to resolve them, including efforts to get more aid into Gaza, bring trapped foreigners out, free hostages taken in the surprise attack and keep the war from spreading.
Aid for Gaza
After more than a week of diplomatic wrangling, an aid convoy of 20 trucks laden with food, water and medicine passed into Gaza from Egypt on Saturday, followed by an additional 14 trucks on Sunday and 20 on Monday. Aid workers were distributing supplies to displaced families in southern Gaza.
Aid officials say Gaza needs scores more trucks to cross every day to meet even basic needs and begin to alleviate the humanitarian crisis that has gripped the enclave in the two weeks since Israel declared a complete blockade of the strip.
Negotiations are continuing on the pace of the deliveries and other issues, including whether fuel can be trucked into Gaza. The United Nations and aid groups have urged that fuel be delivered as quickly as possible, calling it an essential lifeline to keep hospitals, bakeries, water desalination plants and other civilian infrastructure operating.
The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that medical supplies it had sent to Gaza had reached some hospitals and clinics, but because there was no guarantee of safe passage, they had not reached the biggest hospitals, which are in the north of the territory.
Hostages
More than 200 people were taken hostage during the deadly Oct. 7 assault on Israeli border communities, according to the Israeli military. The captives include children and older people. Two — an Israeli-American mother and daughter — were released on Friday for what Hamas described as “humanitarian reasons” after mediation by Qatar, a tiny Gulf nation that has ties to the militants. And two older Israeli women were released on Monday.
Yocheved Lifshitz, one of those women, said her abductors took her through a network of tunnels — “it looked like a spider web,” she said — until they reached a large hall where they had gathered about 25 people. She said doctors visited to check on them. Ms. Lifshitz said it appeared the militants were prepared to hold them for a long time.
Hamas has said the hostages are being held in “safe places and the tunnels of the resistance,” although it has also made unverified claims that several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. It has also said other groups are holding some of the hostages.
Israel’s military said Tuesday that it was asking residents of Gaza to provide information about the hostages, and was willing to offer protection and compensation in return.
Foreigners and dual citizens in Gaza
Hundreds of people with foreign passports are trapped in Gaza, and scores gather most days near the Rafah crossing with Egypt, desperate to escape. Diplomats say little progress has been made on securing them safe passage. There are as many as 600 Americans; 1,200 European Union citizens, including from Sweden, Romania, France, Germany, Spain and other countries; 300 Canadians; 200 British citizens; and 45 Australians in Gaza, according to diplomats.
Some foreign citizens sought to leave through the Rafah crossing when aid trucks entered on Saturday, but Hamas blocked their way, Matthew Miller, the U.S. State Department spokesman, said Monday. “We do believe that Egypt is ready to process American citizens if they can make it to Egyptian authorities,” he told reporters. “Hamas just has to stop blocking the exit.”
Mr. Miller said the United States had been sending messages on the matter to Hamas through “a number of partners.”
A possible ground invasion
In the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack, Israel began calling up army reservists and preparing to invade Gaza to try to eliminate Hamas. It began warning residents of Gaza to move southward for their own safety, while senior Israeli commanders began making public references to the planned assault.
Yet more than two weeks on, the ground invasion has not materialized. U.S. officials say that the Biden administration has advised Israel to delay an invasion in order to allow more time for negotiations to release the hostages, for more humanitarian aid to reach the territory and for the military to carefully consider its attack plan. But some in Israel are becoming frustrated with the delays.
A wider war
Escalating clashes between Israeli forces and Hezbollah on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, as well as Israeli strikes in Syria and in the occupied West Bank, have intensified fears of a wider regional conflict. Israeli authorities have evacuated towns and villages along the border with Lebanon, and Lebanese civilians have begun fleeing their homes on the other side.
The United States has been working behind the scenes to urge Israel against launching a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah — which, like Hamas, is backed by Iran — out of concern that Israel would struggle in a two-front war. U.S. officials are also concerned that if Israel enters Gaza, Iran-backed militias in the region will intensify attacks on U.S. interests.

Following the deadliest assault on Israel in half a century, the country is vowing to crush Hamas, and both sides are bracing for an escalating war.
After the deadliest assault on Israel in 50 years, the right-wing government and members of the centrist opposition formed a unity government on Wednesday to navigate the crisis, while its warplanes rained destruction on the Gaza Strip and both sides braced for an escalating war between Israel and Hamas. 
  The creation of an emergency government came as the devastation of the Hamas incursion that overran dozens of towns and a military base last weekend became clearer: civilians, including children, shot dead in homes, in cars, on streets and in hiding places, with bodies still being recovered and counted. The Israeli government said the toll in the attack had risen to 1,200 people killed, 169 of them Israeli soldiers, almost 3,000 others wounded and an estimated 150 people believed kidnapped and held hostage in Gaza.
  Israel's military forces are carrying out a more intense campaign of airstrikes than in past conflicts with Gaza against Hamas, the group that controls the region, and its allies, killing at least 1,127 people and injuring more than 5,300, according to Gazan health officials, who say most of the casualties are noncombatants, including children. After Israel escalated its 16-year blockade of Gaza to a ''complete siege'' this week, cutting off fuel, water and food, electricity to the region shut down on Wednesday, and hospitals, already overwhelmed, reported that they would soon be unable to function.
  Hamas has threatened to kill hostages if Israel strikes civilian homes without warning.
  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised news conference Wednesday night that the Palestinians who surged into Israel shot children in the head, burned people alive, raped women and beheaded soldiers.
  ''Every Hamas member is a dead man,'' Mr. Netanyahu said. Equating Hamas to the Islamic State, he added, ''It will be crushed and eliminated.''
  President Biden, speaking to reporters in Washington after meeting with Jewish leaders, appeared to back reports of a particularly gruesome atrocity -- one that the Israeli authorities have not verified. ''I never really thought that I would see it and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,'' he said.
  Administration officials said later that the president did not actually see any images of beheaded children but was basing his comments on a variety of news reports. The White House cited five examples from CBS News and Israeli outlets quoting Israeli military officers asserting that children had been beheaded.
  The Israeli government has called up 360,000 reservists, an immense increase in military forces, amid widespread speculation that it will launch a large-scale ground offensive into Gaza, its first since 2014. At the same time, skirmishing and artillery fire on Israel's northern border continued on Wednesday, fueling fears of a major clash with the Lebanese group Hezbollah -- a far more powerful enemy than Hamas -- and a two-front war.
  Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, whose country has long joined Israel in blockading Gaza, said it would not allow Gazans to flee to its territory.
  The deal for an Israeli unity government, between Mr. Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, the leader of an opposition party, creates an emergency ''war management cabinet'' composed of the two of them and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Decision-making will largely remain in the hands of the broader security cabinet, according to a spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu's party, Likud.
  The agreement infuses the government with far greater military experience, a move that could bolster public trust, which has been battered by months of fighting a proposed overhaul of the judiciary by Mr. Netanyahu's far-right and religiously conservative governing coalition, and now by the failure of Israel's vaunted security services to anticipate or quickly defeat the assault from Gaza.
  The 14-member security cabinet now includes four lawmakers who had been in the opposition, including Mr. Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot, both of them former army chiefs who bring a wealth of wartime know-how from previous conflicts with Gaza and Lebanon.
  ''It's about bringing in people who were chief of staff, and who were not involved in the current disaster,'' said Gideon Rahat, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ''They are not responsible for it, so they can help to get out of it.''
  Public trust in government had ebbed all year, following a huge backlash against the government's plan to undermine the power of the courts. The Parliament approved the overhaul in July, and it is being reviewed by Israel's Supreme Court.
  Many reservists said earlier this year that they would refuse to serve if the changes were adopted, prompting Mr. Gallant, the defense minister, to say that the plan would undermine national security.
  With reservists now being mobilized, ''They must know that they have someone to trust in the government,'' Professor Rahat said.
  The main opposition leader, Yair Lapid, said he would not join a unity government as long as it still included the most extreme figures in Mr. Netanyahu's coalition, like Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister. Mr. Ben-Gvir, whose anti-Arab campaigning resulted in a 2007 conviction for inciting racism and supporting a terrorist group, remains in the security cabinet.
  The Hamas attack was far larger than anything the group had attempted before, with coordinated destruction of Israel's network of electronic border surveillance and remote-controlled weaponry, as well as dozens of breaches in the border barrier. The Israeli military, which took days to regain control of the areas affected, has said it recovered the bodies of 1,500 Palestinian gunmen who took part in the assault and were killed.
  The terrorists rampaged through towns, kibbutzim and a music festival, among other locations, killing indiscriminately and taking hostages, in an incursion felt far beyond Israel.
  The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that 22 of the dead were American citizens, up from the 14 cited a day earlier, and officials have said that some of the captives are, as well. John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said that 17 Americans remain unaccounted for but that the number who are hostages is probably ''very small, very small, less than a handful.''
  The government of Thailand said 14 of its citizens were killed, and France said 10 of its people were dead and 18 still missing.
  Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told reporters on Wednesday, just before he boarded a flight to Israel, that his message for Jerusalem would be that the United States has Israel's back. ''We'll have it tomorrow, we'll have it every day,'' he said. ''We stand resolutely against terrorism.''
  Thousands of Israelis have volunteered to dig graves.
  In Gaza, on Israel's southwestern border, conditions rapidly worsened in what local officials and the United Nations described as a humanitarian crisis. The territory's only power plant ran out of fuel and shut down. It was not clear how long supplies of water and food would last.
  Gazans reported that Israeli airstrikes had targeted structures normally considered relatively safe, like schools, hospitals and mosques. Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor living in Gaza, said that previous conflicts started with airstrikes targeting single buildings used as security installations. This time, he said, the attacks had leveled entire neighborhoods.
  ''Nothing is left in areas, almost everything is bombed,'' he said, adding that he had left his home for his brother's home.
  Israel has acknowledged hitting multiple mosques, saying that they were used as staging areas by Hamas and other militant groups.
  As of Tuesday, 250,000 people were in Gaza shelters run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Rescuers in Gaza struggled, with inadequate equipment and dwindling fuel, to reach people buried under the rubble from airstrikes.
  Al-Shifa Hospital, the area's largest medical complex, was treating 800 patients with only 500 beds and was running low on supplies, said its director, Dr. Muhammad Abu Salima. ''We are treating patients in corridors and on the floor,'' he said.
  The hospital had enough fuel to power its backup generators for another four days at most, he added, and had already curtailed power use. Without electricity, he said, ventilators, operating rooms, incubators and other gear will simply stop working.
  ''If electricity stops, our hospitals will become nothing but mass graves,'' Dr. Abu Salima said.
  ''We will sit there and watch the patients die one by one without being able to provide them with medical care,'' he added.
  Israel Katz, the Israeli energy minister, posted on X, formerly called Twitter, ''We will continue to tighten the siege until the Hamas threat to Israel and the world is removed.''
  In the north, the Israeli military said it had struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon with aircraft and artillery on Wednesday, in response to a missile attack by the group. The number of casualties on both sides remained unclear.
  Some Israeli villages near the border are deserted, the only sound being the constant buzz of aerial drones. The troop presence in the region was noticeably heavier than usual, with soldiers operating checkpoints along the roads, stopping vehicles.

Officials from Iran and Hezbollah helped plan the attack, people familiar with the operation said, but the U.S. and its allies have not found evidence directly linking Tehran.
Follow live news updates on the Israel-Hamas war. 
  Last weekend's attack on Israel by Hamas has brought renewed scrutiny of the armed Palestinian group's longstanding relationship with Iran, and questions about whether the Gaza-based group could have pulled off such a sophisticated and devastating operation on its own.
  Iran has a long history of training and arming proxy militia groups in the region, from Gaza to Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. It supports Hamas militarily and has helped it design and produce a domestic missile and rocket system to match the capabilities and material available in Gaza -- an impoverished, densely populated coastal strip that has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt for the past 16 years.
  And over the past year, there have been signs that Iran and its proxies were preparing to take a more aggressive approach toward Israel.
  Gen. Esmail Ghaani, who is in charge of supervising Iran's network of proxy militias as head of the country's paramilitary Quds Force, repeatedly traveled to Lebanon for covert sessions with leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militia that Iran also supports.
  Over the past year, Mr. Ghaani worked to coordinate and unify all of Iran's proxies, according to public statements from Iranian analysts and five Iranians familiar with the work of the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
  Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, held an hourslong online meeting in March with an elite group of strategists from all the Iran-backed militias and told them to get ready for a war with Israel with a scope and reach -- including a ground invasion -- that would mark a new era, according to two participants from Iran and Syria. The participants spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the meeting.
  There are conflicting accounts of whether these activities were leading specifically toward last week's attack by Hamas, which left 1,200 Israelis dead and shattered the country's sense of security.
  Some people familiar with the operation said that a tight circle of leaders from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas helped plan the attack starting over a year ago, trained militants and had advanced knowledge of it. That account is based on interviews with three Iranians affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, one Iranian connected to senior leadership and a Syrian affiliated with Hezbollah.
  Other people say they believe Iran had some involvement but it was not as deep. ''The implementation was all Hamas, but we do not deny Iran's help and support,'' said Ali Barakeh, a senior Hamas official based in Beirut.
  Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly denied the country played a role, even as he and other Iranian leaders praised the carnage. ''We kiss the foreheads and arms of the resourceful and intelligent designers,'' Mr. Khamenei said this week in his first televised speech since the attack. But he added: ''Those who say that the recent saga is the work of non-Palestinians have miscalculated.''
  The United States, Israel and key regional allies have said they have not found evidence in early intelligence gathering that Iran directly helped plan the attack. The United States has collected multiple pieces of intelligence that show that key Iranian leaders were surprised by it, according to several American officials, including people who would typically be aware of operations involving the Quds Forces.
  Israel has also been examining what it knew. ''Israeli intelligence does not have any information according to which Iran initiated or was involved or directly assisted in the terrible attack,'' said Nir Dinar, a spokesman for Israel's military. ''On the other hand, one has to be naïve to think that those in Tehran woke up on Saturday morning and were surprised to hear the news about what happened.''
  It may take months or years to learn all that went into planning the attack, and why Israel's sophisticated intelligence operation missed it. Many parties have incentives to spread disinformation or emphasize different aspects of the narrative; some may want to expand the war as others seek to limit it.
  ''We obviously don't know what happened behind the scenes. This is going to be privileged, secret information that was meant to be kept secret,'' said Afshon Ostovar, an expert on Iran's military and proxies and an associate professor at Naval Postgraduate School. He added that it was safe to assume ''some level of coordination,'' because Iran and Lebanon would not have wanted to be caught off guard by the attack.
  Hamas gunmen captured and interrogated by Israel said they had been training for the latest operation for a year, according to Israeli defense officials. Abu Ubaida, the Hamas spokesman in the Gaza Strip, said in a televised speech that the group had organized a 3,000-person battalion for the attack and had another 1,500 backup fighters. On Tuesday, Israel said it had killed close to 1,600 of those attackers.
  Mr. Barakeh, the Hamas official in Beirut, said in an interview that the attack plans were so tightly held that he only found out about the assault when he received a slew of text messages early on Saturday morning.
  Still, training had been taking place in Lebanon and Syria, and a secret joint command center had been set up in Beirut, according to the Iranians and the Syrian familiar with the operation.
  Hezbollah's top commandos, experienced in urban guerrilla warfare, trained Hamas members in Syria and Lebanon, according to two Iranians. Paragliders trained in Lebanon, they said, while in Syria, the Hamas members were trained to raid Israeli communities and take civilians hostage.
  Hezbollah has helped train other Iran-backed militias from the region before, such as the Houthis in Yemen. The Lebanese group also deployed fighters to Syria during the war there, where they trained and fought alongside Syria's army.
  Over the past six months, Hezbollah created provocations meant to mislead and distract Israel along its northern border with Lebanon and in Syria so it would think the real threat was coming from those areas, according to two Iranians briefed after the attack.
  An Israeli intelligence official confirmed that hundreds of Palestinian fighters from Hamas and other groups, and possibly even more, have been trained in Hezbollah camps in Syria and Lebanon over the past years. While they may have been trained on skills used in the recent attack, he said, that does not mean that the Iranians knew how and when they would use that training.
  One of the Iranians briefed on the operation said that four days before the attack, all those participating were rounded up by Hamas commanders and isolated. Their electronic devices were confiscated and they had no contact with the outside world, something that could help explain why Israel was blindsided. On Oct. 7, several hours before launching the operation, this person said, Hamas commanders informed the attackers that they would be invading Israel on speedboats, on paragliders and over land by breaking through the barbed wire fence along the territory's border using tractors.
  This account of how the attack was carried out could not be independently verified.
  In retrospect, some warning signs that Israel missed may now be more apparent.
  In September, Israeli intelligence officials told The New York Times that they had intelligence suggesting Mr. Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, had ordered a wide campaign against Israel including targeting its citizens abroad, conducting sabotage inside its borders, and smuggling sophisticated weapons to the Palestinians to ignite a civil war in the West Bank.
  That was in retaliation for shadow war operations conducted by Israel in Iran, they said.
  It was not the only talk of broad action. In various meetings of Iran's proxy militias, several attendees said, the emphasis from leaders was that it was time to take advantage of Israel's seething internal divisions over the judicial overhaul pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right coalition.
  In the meeting Mr. Nasrallah held in March, he told militants to prepare for a war on a scale that would mark a turning point in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict (though it is unclear whether he had last week's attack in mind).
  Similarly, in audio reviewed by The Times of an April discussion among members of the Revolutionary Guards, including those involved with proxies in the region, a speaker said, ''The message that is being communicated from Iran these days to the resistance is that we showcase a military maneuver to make the Zionist regime understand it is surrounded from every side.''
  Even before the Hamas attack, some Israeli intelligence officials said that in hindsight, they regretted their support for Israeli targeted killings in Iran and operations to sabotage its nuclear and military facilities, because they had not been a significant deterrent to either Iran's nuclear program or its regional activities. In fact, they had put Iran and Israel on a path of direct confrontation, one of the officials said.
  On Oct. 3, four days before Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, Mr. Khamenei's official account in Farsi posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that said: ''Israel will be gone.''
  The planners of the terror attack on Israel most certainly knew that it carried the risk of igniting a wider regional war. But the parties have long wanted to avenge an accumulation of grievances -- from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and Syria, to the long blockade of Gaza, to the covert war against Iran -- amid a long-held collective determination to destroy Israel.
  They may also have hoped to force Israel into major concessions, like lifting the blockade or keeping Israeli forces from entering the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City -- one of Islam's holiest sites.
  Hamas named its operation against Israel ''The Aqsa Flood.''

A collection of resources to help students learn about Hamas’s recent attack on Israel, the dire situation in Gaza, the conflict’s roots, media literacy and more.
Update, Jan. 27: We published new resources for teaching about the Israel-Hamas war.
On Oct. 7, hundreds of Hamas fighters from Gaza rampaged through border towns in a surprise attack that killed at least 1,300 Israelis. Hamas terrorists killed men, women and children, at home, strolling on the street or dancing at an outdoor festival, and they took more than 150 hostages. Now the region is bracing for further conflict.
In response to the shocking incursion, one of the broadest into Israeli territory in 50 years, Israel has been pummeling the Gaza Strip with airstrikes that have wiped out entire neighborhoods and brought the medical system to the brink of collapse. The Palestinian Health Ministry has said that as of Oct. 13 at least 1,700 Palestinians have been killed.
Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists and troops are now massing at the border, leading to speculation that Israel will soon launch a ground offensive. And in a region with a long history of conflict, Israel has also reported shelling along its borders with Lebanon and Syria, exacerbating fears of a wider conflict.
Students may be confused about what is happening. They may see posts on social media that they don’t have the context to make sense of. Here’s a recent comment about the conflict from a student in North Carolina:
Walking into my first period today, I knew almost nothing about the “war” going on with the Israelis and the Palestine’s. All I saw was an occasional Instagram post and a post on someone’s story saying, “Pray for the Israelis”. But I didn’t look into it at all, not thinking it was a big deal or whatever as teenagers do. But today changed my perspective on it, seeing about the terrors that have occurred in Israel and on the Gaza strip.
On top of that, the decades of violence between Israelis and Palestinians, along with hardened viewpoints and propaganda, make this topic an especially fraught one to explore in the classroom. A student from Illinois commented:
Even though the first attacks just happened over this past weekend, I have heard a lot about what is going on in Israel and how it is horribly affecting the people that live there. I’ve been watching the news, trying to stay as up to date as possible about what is happening there, because I think it’s important for everyone to fully understand what is occurring, especially to the residents of the countries, and why. Based on what I’m watching and hearing, the War is absolutely terrible, but sometimes it’s hard to know what to believe. In other words, what’s propaganda and what are the facts?
In this teaching resource, we use Times reporting, Opinion essays, podcasts and photographs to help teachers and students better understand the events of this week, the complex history of the region, and the myriad issues related to this war. We organize these resources into seven sections that include media literacy, background on the conflict, and first-person accounts of the violence, each with critical thinking questions. Because this is breaking news, we encourage classes to follow live updates. And we invite students to join a conversation with other teenagers at our related student forum.
Before Getting Started
The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians can stir up powerful emotions. Before exploring this subject, we suggest considering this advice for educators from the nonprofit Facing History and Ourselves:
Start with yourself. (Reflect on what perspectives and experiences shape how you view the conflict.)
Know your students. (Consider how this discussion might affect your students.)
Create a reflective classroom community. (Establish rules and guidelines with your students to create a strong foundation for reflection.)
Share examples of upstanding. (Share with your students how people are working together to create a peaceful solution to the conflict.)
A Good Place to Start With Students …
Before looking at news sources as a class, it helps to get a sense of what students are already thinking and feeling. Try these prompts, taken from our related Student Opinion forum:
What have you read, seen or heard about what is going on in Israel and Gaza? What emotions, feelings and thoughts are you experiencing?
What kinds of conversations have you had with friends and family members on this subject?
Where are you getting your information? How do you know that what you are seeing and hearing is accurate?
What questions do you have about what is happening now and its larger context?
You might use the above infographic from Solutions Not Sides, a nonpartisan organization that offers “a critical approach to education on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” to help students understand some basic vocabulary and concepts before presenting the resources below.
I. Hamas’s Attack on Israel
Over the weekend, Hamas, the Islamic group that controls the Gaza Strip, mounted a highly coordinated invasion of Israel, with terrorists attacking Israeli towns and killing people in their homes and on the streets. More than 1,300 Israelis have died so far, including more than 100 young Israelis who were dancing at an outdoor rave. At least 150 Israelis were taken hostage by Hamas.
The Times writes of the Hamas attack:
Hamas began firing thousands of rockets on Saturday morning, striking targets as far away as Tel Aviv and the outskirts of Jerusalem, which rarely see any direct hits because of Israel’s sophisticated Iron Dome missile defense system.

About an hour after the first rocket attacks, Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel by land, sea and air.

The attackers infiltrated 22 Israeli towns and army bases, and took civilians and soldiers hostage. Hamas assailants killed men, women and children, at home, strolling on the street or dancing at an outdoor festival. Dozens of foreigners, including Americans, were among the victims.
To understand what happened on Oct. 7, students might start by exploring one or more of the following resources. Please note that some contain graphic images of violence.
A one-minute video on the attack and Israel’s initial retaliation
Photosfrom both Israel and Gaza (scroll to the bottom to see images from Saturday)
A map of where Hamas rockets struck Israel and Hamas assailants infiltrated Israel towns
A map of the Middle East (zoom in to see where Israel and Gaza are)
A timeline of the attacks in Israel and Gaza
The “Daily” episode “War in Israel” (listen until 3:45 for a firsthand account from a survivor)
Then, students can read the explainer “What We Know About the Hamas Attack and Israel’s Response” or listen to the rest of the “Daily” episode to get a basic understanding of how the fighting began. The article “Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel” provides a fuller picture, but please note that it contains very graphic imagery.
After exploring these resources, have students discuss or write in response to the following prompts:
What did you learn about the Hamas attack on Israel? Share at least three details that stand out to you.
What emotions, feelings and thoughts did you experience while reading about these horrific events?
What questions do you have about the attacks?
II. Israel’s Response and the Situation in Gaza
Israel’s Response
Israel retaliated by pummeling the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, which have been deadlier and more widespread than in past campaigns in Gaza. The airstrikes have wiped out entire neighborhoods, brought Gaza’s medical system to the brink of collapse and forced some 400,000 people into temporary shelters as they face dire shortages of food, water and fuel. Gaza’s health ministry said that 1,799 Palestinians, including 583 children, had been killed since Saturday, and that 7,388 people had been injured.
The Times reports:
In addition to airstrikes on Gaza, the Israeli authorities announced a “complete siege” of the enclave. The Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, vowed that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, which is overcrowded, impoverished, and was already struggling under a suffocating, 16-year blockade by Israel and often Egypt.

The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory.
On Oct. 13, Israel’s military demanded that more than a million civilians in Gaza move to the south of the blockaded coastal strip — a possible precursor to a ground invasion, which the United Nations warned could be calamitous.
To learn more about Israel’s planned response, students might read “What Does a ‘Complete Siege’ of the Gaza Strip Mean?” or listen to another episode of “The Daily,” “Israel’s Plan to Destroy Hamas.”
The Situation in Gaza
Hospitals crowded with patients are running short on fuel. Fearful residents are racing to U.N.-run schools, seeking shelter from airstrikes. Water and electricity have been cut off, the borders are closed, and even the cemeteries do not have room to accommodate all the newly dead.
The Times is continually reporting on the situation in Gaza; students can keep up with the live updates here and on The Times’s short morning podcast “The Headlines.” Below is some recent reporting, which also contains graphic images.
As Warnings of Crisis in Gaza Mount, Palestinians Struggle to Find Room for the Dead (article)
Fighting in Israel and Gaza, in Photos (photos)
Gaza Hospital Inundated With Wounded Patients (video)
As Israeli Invasion Looms, Diplomats Seek to Meet Gaza’s Dire Human Needs (article)
After exploring one or more of the resources above, students might discuss the following or respond in writing:
What do you think of Israel’s pledge to destroy Hamas over its attack? How could Israel’s response lead to a “humanitarian crisis” in Gaza, as some have warned?
What did you learn about the situation in Gaza? Share at least three details that stand out to you. What emotions, feelings and thoughts did you experience while learning about what is happening there?
What questions do you have about Israel’s response to the Hamas attack, the situation in Gaza or anything else you read, saw or heard about the current crisis?
III. First-Person Perspectives
How are civilians in Israel and Gaza experiencing this crisis? First-person accounts of life on the ground in a conflict zone can provide essential perspectives. In the following essays, videos and podcasts, students can hear directly from Israelis and Palestinians:
“The Daily”: Golan’s Story (podcast)
A Son’s Conversation With His Mother as Gunmen Attacked Her Kibbutz (video)
I Hope Someone Somewhere Is Being Kind to My Boy (guest essay)
What More Must the Children of Gaza Suffer? (guest essay)
Two Young Women Capture Life Under Siege Inside Gaza (video)
‘A Day of Horror:’ Kibbutz Massacre Survivors Recount Hamas Attack (Video)
“The Daily” Voices From Gaza (podcast)
Then invite students to respond to the following prompts, in writing or through discussion with a partner:
How did the perspectives of ordinary Israelis and Gazans affect your understanding of the crisis? What quotes and details stood out, and why?
What does watching, listening to or reading these stories make you think and feel? What questions would you like to ask the people profiled in the pieces?
What new questions about the war arose?
IV. How We Got Here
The relentless, deadly conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has been going on for decades. The fighting has left thousands dead. Sometimes, the bloodshed has been set off by Israel targeting Palestinian leaders or responding to protests. Other times, it has been set off by attacks from Hamas or other militants.
Since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007, Gaza has been under a suffocating Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt. The blockade prevents most people from leaving the territory and restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons.
But before this weekend’s attack, there was no obvious flashpoint, and Israel’s intelligence community and government seemed to have been caught by surprise.
To learn more about the roots of the current conflict, students can look at one or more of the following resources from The Times and other news outlets and educational organizations:
Here Is a Timeline of the Clashes Between Palestinian Militants and Israel (The New York Times)
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Timeline (World 101 | Council on Foreign Relations)
Can Israelis and Palestinians See Eye to Eye? (Video: Creators for Change | Middle Ground)
Gaza Has Suffered Under 16-Year Blockade (The New York Times)
A Quick Look at Hamas (The New York Times)
Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked (The New York Times)
Everything You Need to Know About Israel-Palestine (Vox, 2018)
The Israel-Palestine Conflict: A Brief, Simple History (Video, Vox, 2016)
Then students can respond to the following prompts, in writing or through discussion with a partner:
What did you learn about the roots of the conflict? How does it connect to what is happening today?
What questions do you still have?
Roger Cohen, reporting from Israel, says in the TikTok above: “There are two stories. There are two narratives. There are two versions of events.” What are the two versions of events that explain the cycle of violence in the region?
V. Media Literacy
The Israel-Hamas war is playing out on our phones, computers and televisions. In the past week, social media has been flooded with misinformation, including old or unrelated videos and photos with inaccurate claims as well as fabricated assertions about the involvement of countries like the United States and Ukraine. The proliferation of false information has added confusion and deception to an already chaotic moment.
In “Fact or Fiction? In This War, It Is Hard to Tell,” Steven Lee Myers writes:
The major social media platforms, once heralded for their ability to document global events in real time, face a crisis of authenticity — one of their own making, critics say.
The war between Israel and Hamas has spawned so much false or misleading information online — much of it intentional, though not all — that it has obscured what is actually happening on the ground.
In turn, people are turning to sources that mirror their feelings, deepening social and political divisions. There are so many untrue claims that some people question the true ones. And it is not just on X, formerly known as Twitter, which has removed many of its guardrails in recent months. The recent advances in artificial intelligence — with programs that can produce virtually unlimited amounts of content — are already compounding that digital cacophony.
The authenticity crisis, though, is broader than the social networks that have come to dominate public discourse.
Trust in mainstream news outlets has eroded, too, with news organizations regularly accused of refracting state, corporate or political interests. That has helped propel a profusion of alternative sites online. Many hew to a particular point of view, shared by users online and boosted by algorithms that reward shocking or emotional content over nuance or balance.
“We have distorted the information ecosystem,” said Nora Benavidez, the senior counsel for Free Press, an advocacy organization.
Now is a good time to remind students of media literacy strategies they can use while consuming news about this conflict from social media or other sources. Here are some helpful tools from around the web:
An infographic from the News Literacy Project on how to spot misinformation
On the Media’s Breaking News Consumer’s Handbook
The SIFT method from the digital literacy expert Mike Caulfield, which advises readers to stop, investigate, find better coverage and trace claims back to their original context
Five critical thinking questionsto ask about media, from Common Sense
A guide from FAIR, the national media watchdog group, on how to detect bias in news media
An article from Vox about how to avoid spreading misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war
You might invite students to use one of these tools as they consume news on the current conflict and to share what they learned with the class. Here are some questions that can help guide a class discussion:
How closely have you been following the news about Israel and Gaza? Where are you getting your information? How much of your understanding is from social media?
How do you know that what you are seeing and hearing is accurate? How do you go about determining whether a source is reliable before you share it on social media?
How do you know when something you are seeing is biased? What kind of language do you look for? Can you share examples of what you think is biased or unbiased coverage? 
Consider this criticism of The Times’s coverage. Do you agree or disagree? Then, use the SIFT method to investigate the source. Does the information you found change the way you feel about the statements? Why or why not?
Which voices or perspectives have been most represented in the news media you have seen or read? Which have been missing?
In this particular conflict, why might we need to be especially careful about the media we consume?
VI. Responses Around the World
In a televised address, President Biden forcefully condemned Hamas’s actions as “pure, unadulterated evil” and vowed unequivocally to stand with Israel against terrorism. He said victims had been “butchered” and “slaughtered,” and he decried the “bloodthirstiness” of the assailants.
The U.N.’s top human rights official condemned the “horrifying mass killings” and executions that Palestinian armed groups have been accused of committing. At the same time, he warned that Israel’s announcement of a “complete siege” of Gaza would worsen the “already dire” humanitarian conditions there.
In Middle Eastern nations, many people do not view Israel as the victim of an unprovoked terrorist attack — as many American officials have described it — but rather as a colonial-style occupier, buttressed by the United States, that continually violates the rights of the Palestinians. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in Iraq on Oct. 13 in a show of support for the Palestinians. Imams leading prayers in Lebanon denounced the state of Israel. And in the island nation of Bahrain, videos shared by activists showed protesters walking on Israeli and American flags.
In the United States, protests took place at Columbia University and the City University of New York. At Columbia, hundreds gathered on Oct. 12 for competing pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations that led school administrators to take the extraordinary step of closing the campus to the public.
To learn more about how the world is responding, students might read one or more of these Times articles:
In Unforgiving Terms, Biden Condemns ‘Evil’ and ‘Abhorrent’ Attack on Israel
Protests Erupt Across the Middle East Over Israel’s Siege of Gaza
Columbia Closes Campus as Israel-Hamas War Protests Erupt
At Harvard, a Battle Over What Should Be Said About the Hamas Attacks
After Attack on Israel, Politicians Are Asked, ‘Which Side Are You On?’
‘I Was Very Alone Today’: Young Jewish Americans Grieve Over Israel
Then invite students to respond to the following prompts, in writing or through discussion with a partner:
What do you think about the different responses around the world to the events in Israel and Gaza?
Have there been discussions, debates, demonstrations or protests in your community about the conflict? How have your local elected leaders responded to the events of the past week? Are you comfortable learning more and sharing your own opinions about the conflict?
What role, if any, do you think the United States, other countries and the U.N. should play in the conflict?
VII. What Comes Next
How should we make sense of the shocking, horrific and violent events of the past week? What will come next? Is there potential for resolution, peace or justice? Or will the conflict escalate and lead to further tragedy?
There is no easy path forward or consensus on what should be done. Here are four perspectives from the Opinion pages of The Times to consider:
1. In “The Attack on Israel Demands Unity and Resolve,” the New York Times editorial board writes:
President Biden is right to express America’s full support for Israel at this painful moment. The United States, as its closest ally, has a critical role to play. Moderate Israeli opposition leaders said they were prepared to join Mr. Netanyahu in an emergency government. The Biden administration, and all of Israel’s friends and allies, should encourage such a broad coalition. A unity government is the best chance Israel has to come together to defend itself against aggression, as it has at so many times in its history, and emerge from this war able to keep working toward a stable, secure future that includes peace with the Palestinians.
It is also the administration’s duty to work to prevent this terrible eruption of violence from spreading from Gaza to involve Palestinians in the West Bank. Mr. Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others have an invaluable role to play in maintaining open communication with leaders of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and of neighboring Arab states to urge calm.
2. In “Seeking a Moral Compass in Gaza’s War,” the columnist Nicholas Kristof writes:
The terror attacks by Hamas against civilians who were in their homes and dancing at a concert are being called Israel’s Sept. 11, and that’s a fair comparison.
Let’s hope that Israel responds to this outrage more wisely than we in the United States did to the attack on our country.
There’s a lot of loose talk about eliminating Hamas, and Hamas deserves it. As a journalist who has traveled repeatedly to Gaza, I’m appalled by the sympathy that some Americans and Europeans have shown for a misogynist and repressive terror organization like Hamas. If you care about human rights, you want to see Hamas eliminated.
Yet dismantling terrorist organizations can be harder than it looks and can raise troubling moral questions about collateral damage. The Taliban also deserved elimination, yet in the end it was the United States that was eliminated from Afghanistan. I worry that Israel may charge into Gaza with a ground invasion as thoughtlessly as we plowed into Iraq.
He continues:
If we owe a moral responsibility to Israeli children, then we owe the same moral responsibility to Palestinian children. Their lives have equal weight. If you care about human life only in Israel or only in Gaza, then you don’t actually care about human life.
What that means in practice is difficult to navigate. Israel has a right to respond, and in war, civilians inevitably suffer.
3. In the guest essay “What More Must the Children of Gaza Suffer?” Fadi Abu Shammalah, the executive director of the General Union of Cultural Centers in Gaza, writes:
I am trying to imagine some positive outcome that this terrifying escalation might bring. Perhaps there will be an exchange of prisoners. Though Palestinians have the right to resist occupation, I have always preferred unarmed, civilian-led, direct mass action. Maybe the Palestinian, Israeli and international activists who have been using these tactics to oppose Israel’s occupation and a system that major human rights organizations — including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Israeli rights group B’Tselem — consider apartheid will be able to harness this horror to someday advance their vision of a future of liberation and a decent life for all.
But at the moment, with Israeli troops massing on the border with Gaza, suggesting an imminent ground invasion, I can’t think beyond the coming days.
How many more families will be obliterated? How many children will be made orphans and homeless? What will happen when the shelves in our markets are empty and reserves of fuel for our hospitals’ generators run out? What will become of our collective humanity if Israeli civilians continue to be targeted and bombs keep shattering our infrastructure, leaving Gazan children lying dead in our streets?
Unless the international community intervenes, Israel can continue to cut off access to water, food, fuel, electricity, medications and every other necessity of life. Without outside pressure, particularly from the United States, Israel can continue to flatten our cities and refugee camps.
4. And in “The Pathways to Peace Are Getting Darker,” Dahlia Scheindlin, a political strategist and public opinion expert who lives in Tel Aviv, writes:
Hamas’s savage attack was a shock — but not a surprise. We have all watched peacemaking fail here, as it often does. This isn’t just a crisis for grass-roots peace activists, it’s a grand failure on a global stage. Lately the whole notion of solving conflicts, containing violence through international rules and institutions, the international system itself, appears wholly inadequate to the task of protecting people and preventing wars.
She continues:
But I can’t leave it there. I’ve seen the other side, too — solidarity that cuts across bitter political divides. My Palestinian and Israeli friends and colleagues comfort one another in times of escalation; we bond over our commitment to ending systems of oppression and injustice, and deplore violence against civilians. Hundreds of Jewish and Palestinian activists in Israel met on Zoom in the midst of the horror last Saturday to organize against the awful specter of violence in Israel’s mixed Jewish-Arab towns.
As the old peace paradigms collapse, those of us working on new approaches toward partnership-based peace (including a group called “A Land for All,” where I am a board member), rather than the hard partition that stokes us-or-them competition, generate new energy. Political peace may be light-years away, but these rare sparks of optimism are the fuel that will carry us there.
Share these excerpts with students and then invite them to choose one or more essays to respond to, either by writing a letter back to the author or by selecting three quotes that made an impression and explaining why.
Some things to consider: What did you learn from these voices and perspectives? How do they help you to better understand the current crisis? Which of their words do you most hope leaders in Israel, Gaza and around the world heed moving forward? What questions do you still have about this complicated and emotional situation?

To the Editor: 
  Re ''Israel Orders Siege; Hamas Issues Threats'' (front page, Oct. 10):
  As an emergency room physician on duty five blocks from the twin towers on 9/11, I witnessed the carnage of innocents. I grieve for Israel. Then, as now, the world closed ranks with the victims.
  I pray that in its counterstrikes Israel will not commit our mistake. Instead of securing one victory and a lasting peace, we Americans went too far and lost not only two wars, thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, but also our moral standing in the world.
  Antonio J. DajerRiverside, Conn.
  To the Editor:
  Re ''The Attack on Israel Demands Unity and Resolve'' (editorial, Oct. 10):
  This inexcusable and horrific attack by Hamas has been a long time coming. It is the symptom of Israel's disregard for Palestinian human rights and international law, which watchdogs like Amnesty International are constantly reporting on.
  The editorial board is swayed by deference to U.S. foreign policy orthodoxy. It fears that terrorists will have ''veto'' power over Israel's future, by disrupting the Saudi-Israeli rapprochement efforts, yet Israel has veto power over the disenfranchised West Bank population.
  It reminds both sides to respect international law, but fails to mention Israel's blatant disregard for international law when it comes to settlements and collective punishment. Any discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that fails to mention the half-century occupation of the West Bank is already dubious.
  None of this is to justify Hamas's campaign of antisemitic terrorism.
  Unwavering Western support of Israel endorses its settlements and war crimes, and any real solution to this conflict requires cutting off U.S. military aid to Israel. Please hold Israel up to a standard, any standard -- international law preferably.
  I empathize deeply with all who are suffering in this conflict and hope for a just, peaceful future.
  Theodore Yohalem ShouseMontreal
  To the Editor:
  That did not take long. Just a few days after Hamas launched its vicious attacks, the editorial board has already gone down a familiar path, chastising Israel for the loss of civilian lives arising from its well-justified retaliation, accusing Israel of imposing ''collective punishment,'' and calling for an end to the ''cycle of violence'' (as if both sides share the blame).
  No doubt the utter savagery to which Israel has been subjected will soon be forgotten and we will hear another standard accusation: that its response is ''disproportionate.''
  Kenneth A. MargolisChappaqua, N.Y.
  To the Editor:
  As long as Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled Israel, we have plunged into deeper hatred as his government erodes Palestinians' rights and grabs their land and future.
  This is no way to support dignity and achieve long-term peace on either side.

  Baseball Changes, to Jeers and Cheers
  To the Editor:
  Re ''Baseball Has Lost Its Poetry,'' by Jesse Nathan (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Oct. 5):
  As a 90-year-old baseball fan, starting with my Brooklyn Dodgers in 1940, I have watched the evolution of the game and its schedule and would like to kill all of the changes.
  It's bad enough that the clock, the base size, the automatic walk, etc. have imposed ''time'' on the game; the schedule is a nightmare. I want to watch my team play only teams in its own league, not every other team. The old way built classic rivalries that are now dying.
  The season is too long. It also has a negative effect on players, contributing to injuries. Give me the old 154-game season (or even fewer games, given the postseason), then a World Series before it gets really cold.
  Alan WallachEnglewood, N.J.
  To the Editor:
  The pitch clock speeding up games is a good thing, though maybe not for vendors trying to sell a few more hot dogs or poets bemoaning a betrayal of the game's pastoral 19th-century roots.
  The real sin is the designated hitter rule, which robs the game of strategy, complexity and the chance that a lousy hitter might do something unexpectedly wondrous.
  Catchers are notoriously slow afoot, so should we have designated runners? What about a designated thrower for outfielders with bad arms?
  Now I am a Mets fan, so I know suffering. Arguably, speeding up the game with the pitch clock puts us out of our misery more quickly.
  But the designated hitter rule makes the game more boring, less likely to keep baseball fans arguing through the cold winter months. What are we going to do? Watch the Knicks?
  Bob LiffNew York
  To the Editor:
  As Jesse Nathan points out, the compressing of time on the field diminishes the game of baseball. The filling of time off the field is another factor.
  Spectators are entertained with videos on the Jumbotron, directed to their phones for contests and exhorted by fake cheers. The game has become one of many entertainments at the stadium.
  Something Mr. Nathan won't have to lament this year, however, is ''the oxymoron of baseball in Boston in November.''

  Children's Gun Deaths
  To the Editor:
  Re ''Study Finds Gun Deaths of Children Are Up'' (news article, Oct. 7):
  The astonishing and terrible findings of an 87 percent increase in gun fatalities for people under 18 between 2011 and 2021 make clear the frightening public health emergency occurring in the United States today.
  Every parent, every child, every person who cares about children should be demanding gun safety features in their loudest voices. Demand them of local politicians (here in Pennsylvania the state legislature has taken the right to control guns away from the local government), demand them of senators and representatives at the state and national levels. Parents can ask the parents in the homes where their children visit whether there are guns, and if so, how they are stored.
  Children are dying totally preventable deaths! How can anyone be opposed to the regulations that will change that?
  As a 79-year-old retired pediatrician, I have been around long enough to see children die of a host of diseases that we can (and do) now prevent, so it is heartbreaking to see that child deaths are going up -- because of something that's a lot easier to prevent than polio was.

  Turtles and Us
  To the Editor:
  Re ''What Do We Owe Turtles?,'' by Robin Wall Kimmerer (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 24):
  May humans protect turtles -- and all wildlife -- with the vigor we exert to protect our selfish wants. No turtles, no us.
  Ann BradleyLos Angeles

Hamas’s Hostages

Body


The scale of the hostage situation in the Gaza Strip has no recent precedent. 
Shiri Bibas, a young mother, is holding her two redheaded sons — Ariel, who’s 4, and Kfir, 9 months — as armed militants surround them in an online video.
In a separate video, Doron Asher Katz, who’s 34, is being blindfolded in the back of a pickup truck. Next to her are her mother Efrat Katz, 67, and her daughters, Raz, 5, and Aviv, 3.
Twelve-year-old Erez Kalderon appears in yet another video, being pushed down a path by Palestinian militia members.
Noam Elyakim, a father, can be seen limping while militants march him across the border into Gaza. When attackers entered his home on Saturday, they shot him in the leg and used his wife’s phone to livestream as they abducted the family, including his daughters Dafna, 15, and Ella, 8.
Yaffa Adar, 85, is the woman in an image that much of the world has seen, as she sat in a golf cart that militants drove into Gaza. She normally takes medication for chronic pain and heart and lung conditions. “Without her medication, every minute is a horror for her,” Adar’s granddaughter told The Washington Post.
There is no recent precedent for the scale of the hostage situation in the Gaza Strip. Hamas, the militant group that governs much of Gaza, abducted about 150 people during its weekend invasion of southern Israel. Most of the hostages are civilians. Hamas has threatened to execute them one by one and videotape the killings each time an Israeli airstrike hits Gazans in their homes.
No modern government — not even the world’s most brutal, like those in Russia or North Korea — has used hostages in this way: as human shields, under threat of public execution. It is a reminder of why both the U.S. government and European Union categorize Hamas as a terrorist organization.
War is here
The hostages are also shaping the initial stages of this new war between Israel and Hamas, complicating Israel’s planned retaliation.
Israel has a long history of prioritizing the lives of its citizens who have been taken hostage. The country has launched rescue military operations, such as the successful 1976 raid in Entebbe, Uganda. Israel has also swapped prisoners with Hamas: In 2011, it traded more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for a single soldier, Gilad Shalit. One prisoner whom Israel released then is now the leader of Hamas.
Some Israelis hope that their government can negotiate at least a limited exchange again, perhaps involving children or the elderly. But many analysts doubt that a wholesale exchange will happen. “The idea of a prisoner swap now seems very distant,” Patrick Kingsley, The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief, told us.
Why? For one thing, the number of hostages is larger. But the main obstacle may be that Hamas is unwilling to make a deal under the current circumstances.
Global outrage
Both sides know that Israel is on the verge of a full-scale invasion of Gaza, intended to destroy Hamas and prevent future attacks. Israelis seem largely united behind this goal, despite their political divisions: Hamas’s attacks have killed at least 1,200 Israelis — relative to population size, the equivalent of around 44,000 Americans.
Many victims were defenseless civilians. One video shows a group of armed Hamas members marching four Israelis, with their hands tied behind their backs, down a street. Another video, analyzed by The Washington Post, shows the four lying on the same street, shot dead.
(This Times project begins to catalog the horrors.)
The one incentive for Hamas to release hostages may be global opinion. After several years in which left-leaning Americans and Europeans became more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, the horror of the recent attacks has put some Palestinian supporters on the defensive. “I think that the brutality here is not helping the Palestinian cause,” Stephen Walt, a Harvard political scientist, said. (A pro-Palestinian rally in New York on Sunday exposed the new divisions.)
President Biden referred yesterday to the threatened executions as a “violation of every code of human morality.” Our colleague Peter Baker described Biden’s comments as “one of the sharpest, even angriest condemnations of terrorism in Israel that I’ve ever heard from an American president in covering the White House since the 1990s.” 
Israel’s dilemma
Israel faces its own strategic quandaries. Hamas is likely holding the hostages in small groups, scattered through tunnels beneath Gaza, to make a large rescue operation impossible. Any Israeli attacks on Gaza risk killing hostages, including citizens of the U.S. and Thailand. (Here’s what we know about the missing Americans.)
“This is a challenge of a magnitude that has never been faced before,” Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote this week.
Most experts ruefully say that they expect more hostages to die. As Hoffman put it, “How this crisis will end is anyone’s guess, but the shedding of more innocent blood — Israeli, Palestinians and indeed noncombatant citizens of other countries — is certain.” Danielle Gilbert, a Northwestern University professor who has studied hostage-taking, told us she was worried that some people, especially the very young and old, may have a hard time surviving captivity.
In the meantime, Israeli families have created their own informal groups to publicize the details about their missing relatives. By humanizing them to the world, the families hope to spare their lives.
The latest
A first shipment of U.S. weapons arrived in Israel, and Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, is heading there.
After retaking towns near Gaza, the Israeli military is preparing for a major offensive.
Israel clashed with Hezbollah on the border with Lebanon. Experts worry about a broader conflict.
Residents of Gaza say Israeli airstrikes have hit schools, hospitals and mosques — structures that are normally safe. Israel says it is targeting only sites connected to Hamas.
Israel’s military and spy operations are world-class. But their failures led to the worst breach of Israeli defenses in half a century.
Hamas is spreading violent videos on sites with minimal content moderation, like X, formerly known as Twitter.
A student group at Harvard blamed Israel for the violence and received a furious response.

The terrorist attack by Hamas against Israelis -- the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust -- was horrid, barbaric and inexcusable. Israel has a right to defend itself and pursue the perpetrators. 
  What is happening to innocent citizens of Gaza, and what is likely to happen to them as the war between Israel and Hamas continues -- evacuation orders are imposed, electricity and basic supplies are cut off -- is also horrid and not a justifiable response to the terrorist attacks.
  The developing status of this war illustrates just how quickly perceptions about who has the moral high ground can evolve in conflicts like this.
  Ordinary people, particularly children, are caught in a political and military clash in which they have played no part. They cannot and should not be targeted in any way. Nor should they be written off as collateral damage in a ''righteous'' war.
  When our empathies have boundaries -- when they stop at borders, races, ethnicities -- when one group is freely granted them while another is wholly deprived, then our empathies are false. They have been weaponized. They are instruments in an argument.
  Last week, Israel called for the evacuation of more than a million citizens from the northern Gaza Strip, a monumental undertaking at any time, let alone in the middle of a conflict.
  The World Health Organization said last Friday that such an evacuation would be ''disastrous,'' following up the next day by saying that the evacuation could ''further worsen the current humanitarian and public health catastrophe.''
  This all came as Palestinian deaths in Gaza continued to mount.
  As Sari Bashi, the program director at Human Rights Watch, wrote on Sunday about the potential harms of the evacuation order, ''War crimes by one party don't justify war crimes by the other.'' She noted that under the laws of war, ''the fact that Hamas-led fighters targeted civilians doesn't allow the Israeli military to target civilians or flout its obligations to protect them.''
  In other words, a gloves-are-off, by-any-means-necessary retaliation is wholly unacceptable, regardless of who is engaged in it.
  Yet there's been an acute debate around this very question here in America in recent days.
  Most Americans assess this conflict the way they do many others: at arm's length and an ocean away. And they do so through the prism of their own sense of fairness and justice.
  In this case, there is something of a partisan and generational schism, with some progressive Democrats and younger Americans more likely to express a greater degree of sympathy for the Palestinian people or at least less reflexive support for Israel, according to polls.
  Many of those who share this view are part of what Elizabeth Alexander, a writer, poet and scholar and the president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, has called the Trayvon generation -- young people who have come of age in the decade since the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012. It's a generation that has become highly attuned to intersectionality, the history and current expressions of various forms of oppression, and the ways in which colonialism, imperialism and capitalism undermine the concepts of equality and justice.
  And just because the country as a whole seems to have turned the page on its fleeting interest, circa 2020, in the movement born of this generation of Americans, that doesn't mean the impulses and understandings of members of this generation simply evaporate. Social and racial justice is still their compass. It is a part of who they are and how they think. And it is with that compass that many of them evaluate the broader dispute over Israel's control of the occupied territories and the immediate conflict between Israel and Hamas.
  I think it would be a great mistake to bemoan the position taken by many of these young people -- the seekers of context, not the defenders of terrorism, of course -- rather than seek to understand it.
  In politics, you convert people by convincing them, not condemning them.
  Is there antisemitism coming from some in the debate over this conflict? Yes, and that must be called out. But you can be opposed to Israeli government policies without being antisemitic, so we should take care not to conflate all opposition to Israeli government policies with hatred of Jewish people. Lumping together any kind of support for Palestinians in this moment as inherently hostile to Israel's Jewish citizens and to Jewish people around the world is also problematic -- and intellectually dishonest.
  And we should similarly take care not to equate the views of all Palestinians with the views or actions of Hamas. A July poll commissioned by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and conducted by the Palestinian Center for Public Opinion found that 62 percent of Gazans supported Hamas maintaining a cease-fire with Israel, and half agreed with this proposition: ''Hamas should stop calling for Israel's destruction, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.''
  In our country, many people are simply trying their best to make sense of a complex situation and coming to a conclusion that the context of the conflict, both historical and present, muddies the moral waters.
  All infliction of human suffering is wrong, and we should all be willing and able to object to and resist it whenever we see it, no matter who imposes it or who endures it.

To the Editor:
Re “Israel Orders Siege; Hamas Issues Threats” (front page, Oct. 10):
As an emergency room physician on duty five blocks from the twin towers on 9/11, I witnessed the carnage of innocents. I grieve for Israel. Then, as now, the world closed ranks with the victims.
I pray that in its counterstrikes Israel will not commit our mistake. Instead of securing one victory and a lasting peace, we Americans went too far and lost not only two wars, thousands of lives and trillions of dollars, but also our moral standing in the world.
Antonio J. Dajer
Riverside, Conn.
To the Editor:
Re “The Attack on Israel Demands Unity and Resolve” (editorial, Oct. 10):
This inexcusable and horrific attack by Hamas has been a long time coming. It is the symptom of Israel’s disregard for Palestinian human rights and international law, which watchdogs like Amnesty International are constantly reporting on.
The editorial board is swayed by deference to U.S. foreign policy orthodoxy. It fears that terrorists will have “veto” power over Israel’s future, by disrupting the Saudi-Israeli rapprochement efforts, yet Israel has veto power over the disenfranchised West Bank population.
It reminds both sides to respect international law, but fails to mention Israel’s blatant disregard for international law when it comes to settlements and collective punishment. Any discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that fails to mention the half-century occupation of the West Bank is already dubious.
None of this is to justify Hamas’s campaign of antisemitic terrorism.
Unwavering Western support of Israel endorses its settlements and war crimes, and any real solution to this conflict requires cutting off U.S. military aid to Israel. Please hold Israel up to a standard, any standard — international law preferably.
I empathize deeply with all who are suffering in this conflict and hope for a just, peaceful future.
Theodore Yohalem Shouse
Montreal
To the Editor:
That did not take long. Just a few days after Hamas launched its vicious attacks, the editorial board has already gone down a familiar path, chastising Israel for the loss of civilian lives arising from its well-justified retaliation, accusing Israel of imposing “collective punishment,” and calling for an end to the “cycle of violence” (as if both sides share the blame).
No doubt the utter savagery to which Israel has been subjected will soon be forgotten and we will hear another standard accusation: that its response is “disproportionate.”

To the Editor:
As long as Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled Israel, we have plunged into deeper hatred as his government erodes Palestinians’ rights and grabs their land and future.
This is no way to support dignity and achieve long-term peace on either side.

Baseball Changes, to Jeers and Cheers
To the Editor:
Re “Baseball Has Lost Its Poetry,” by Jesse Nathan (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Oct. 5):
As a 90-year-old baseball fan, starting with my Brooklyn Dodgers in 1940, I have watched the evolution of the game and its schedule and would like to kill all of the changes.
It’s bad enough that the clock, the base size, the automatic walk, etc. have imposed “time” on the game; the schedule is a nightmare. I want to watch my team play only teams in its own league, not every other team. The old way built classic rivalries that are now dying.
The season is too long. It also has a negative effect on players, contributing to injuries. Give me the old 154-game season (or even fewer games, given the postseason), then a World Series before it gets really cold.
Alan Wallach
Englewood, N.J.
To the Editor:
The pitch clock speeding up games is a good thing, though maybe not for vendors trying to sell a few more hot dogs or poets bemoaning a betrayal of the game’s pastoral 19th-century roots.
The real sin is the designated hitter rule, which robs the game of strategy, complexity and the chance that a lousy hitter might do something unexpectedly wondrous.
Catchers are notoriously slow afoot, so should we have designated runners? What about a designated thrower for outfielders with bad arms?
Now I am a Mets fan, so I know suffering. Arguably, speeding up the game with the pitch clock puts us out of our misery more quickly.
But the designated hitter rule makes the game more boring, less likely to keep baseball fans arguing through the cold winter months. What are we going to do? Watch the Knicks?
Bob Liff

To the Editor:
As Jesse Nathan points out, the compressing of time on the field diminishes the game of baseball. The filling of time off the field is another factor.
Spectators are entertained with videos on the Jumbotron, directed to their phones for contests and exhorted by fake cheers. The game has become one of many entertainments at the stadium.
Something Mr. Nathan won’t have to lament this year, however, is “the oxymoron of baseball in Boston in November.”

Children’s Gun Deaths
To the Editor:
Re “Study Finds Gun Deaths of Children Are Up” (news article, Oct. 7):
The astonishing and terrible findings of an 87 percent increase in gun fatalities for people under 18 between 2011 and 2021 make clear the frightening public health emergency occurring in the United States today.
Every parent, every child, every person who cares about children should be demanding gun safety features in their loudest voices. Demand them of local politicians (here in Pennsylvania the state legislature has taken the right to control guns away from the local government), demand them of senators and representatives at the state and national levels. Parents can ask the parents in the homes where their children visit whether there are guns, and if so, how they are stored.
Children are dying totally preventable deaths! How can anyone be opposed to the regulations that will change that?
As a 79-year-old retired pediatrician, I have been around long enough to see children die of a host of diseases that we can (and do) now prevent, so it is heartbreaking to see that child deaths are going up — because of something that’s a lot easier to prevent than polio was.

Turtles and Us
To the Editor:
Re “What Do We Owe Turtles?,” by Robin Wall Kimmerer (Opinion guest essay, Sept. 24):
May humans protect turtles — and all wildlife — with the vigor we exert to protect our selfish wants. No turtles, no us.

Hamas Attack on Israel Brings New Scrutiny of Group’s Ties to Iran

Officials from Iran and Hezbollah helped plan the attack, people familiar with the operation said, but the U.S. and its allies have not found evidence directly linking Tehran.
Follow live news updates on the Israel-Hamas war.
Last weekend’s attack on Israel by Hamas has brought renewed scrutiny of the armed Palestinian group’s longstanding relationship with Iran, and questions about whether the Gaza-based group could have pulled off such a sophisticated and devastating operation on its own.
Iran has a long history of training and arming proxy militia groups in the region, from Gaza to Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. It supports Hamas militarily and has helped it design and produce a domestic missile and rocket system to match the capabilities and material available in Gaza — an impoverished, densely populated coastal strip that has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt for the past 16 years.
And over the past year, there have been signs that Iran and its proxies were preparing to take a more aggressive approach toward Israel.
Gen. Esmail Ghaani, who is in charge of supervising Iran’s network of proxy militias as head of the country’s paramilitary Quds Force, repeatedly traveled to Lebanon for covert sessions with leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, a Shiite Lebanese militia that Iran also supports.
Over the past year, Mr. Ghaani worked to coordinate and unify all of Iran’s proxies, according to public statements from Iranian analysts and five Iranians familiar with the work of the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.
Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, held an hourslong online meeting in March with an elite group of strategists from all the Iran-backed militias and told them to get ready for a war with Israel with a scope and reach — including a ground invasion — that would mark a new era, according to two participants from Iran and Syria. The participants spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the meeting.
There are conflicting accounts of whether these activities were leading specifically toward last week’s attack by Hamas, which left 1,200 Israelis dead and shattered the country’s sense of security.
Some people familiar with the operation said that a tight circle of leaders from Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas helped plan the attack starting over a year ago, trained militants and had advanced knowledge of it. That account is based on interviews with three Iranians affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards, one Iranian connected to senior leadership and a Syrian affiliated with Hezbollah.
Other people say they believe Iran had some involvement but it was not as deep. “The implementation was all Hamas, but we do not deny Iran’s help and support,” said Ali Barakeh, a senior Hamas official based in Beirut.
Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly denied the country played a role, even as he and other Iranian leaders praised the carnage. “We kiss the foreheads and arms of the resourceful and intelligent designers,” Mr. Khamenei said this week in his first televised speech since the attack. But he added: “Those who say that the recent saga is the work of non-Palestinians have miscalculated.”
The United States, Israel and key regional allies have said they have not found evidence in early intelligence gathering that Iran directly helped plan the attack. The United States has collected multiple pieces of intelligence that show that key Iranian leaders were surprised by it, according to several American officials, including people who would typically be aware of operations involving the Quds Forces.
Israel has also been examining what it knew. “Israeli intelligence does not have any information according to which Iran initiated or was involved or directly assisted in the terrible attack,” said Nir Dinar, a spokesman for Israel’s military. “On the other hand, one has to be naïve to think that those in Tehran woke up on Saturday morning and were surprised to hear the news about what happened.”
It may take months or years to learn all that went into planning the attack, and why Israel’s sophisticated intelligence operation missed it. Many parties have incentives to spread disinformation or emphasize different aspects of the narrative; some may want to expand the war as others seek to limit it.
“We obviously don’t know what happened behind the scenes. This is going to be privileged, secret information that was meant to be kept secret,” said Afshon Ostovar, an expert on Iran’s military and proxies and an associate professor at Naval Postgraduate School. He added that it was safe to assume “some level of coordination,” because Iran and Lebanon would not have wanted to be caught off guard by the attack.
Hamas gunmen captured and interrogated by Israel said they had been training for the latest operation for a year, according to Israeli defense officials. Abu Ubaida, the Hamas spokesman in the Gaza Strip, said in a televised speech that the group had organized a 3,000-person battalion for the attack and had another 1,500 backup fighters. On Tuesday, Israel said it had killed close to 1,600 of those attackers.
Mr. Barakeh, the Hamas official in Beirut, said in an interview that the attack plans were so tightly held that he only found out about the assault when he received a slew of text messages early on Saturday morning.
Still, training had been taking place in Lebanon and Syria, and a secret joint command center had been set up in Beirut, according to the Iranians and the Syrian familiar with the operation.
Hezbollah’s top commandos, experienced in urban guerrilla warfare, trained Hamas members in Syria and Lebanon, according to two Iranians. Paragliders trained in Lebanon, they said, while in Syria, the Hamas members were trained to raid Israeli communities and take civilians hostage.
Hezbollah has helped train other Iran-backed militias from the region before, such as the Houthis in Yemen. The Lebanese group also deployed fighters to Syria during the war there, where they trained and fought alongside Syria’s army.
Over the past six months, Hezbollah created provocations meant to mislead and distract Israel along its northern border with Lebanon and in Syria so it would think the real threat was coming from those areas, according to two Iranians briefed after the attack.
An Israeli intelligence official confirmed that hundreds of Palestinian fighters from Hamas and other groups, and possibly even more, have been trained in Hezbollah camps in Syria and Lebanon over the past years. While they may have been trained on skills used in the recent attack, he said, that does not mean that the Iranians knew how and when they would use that training.
One of the Iranians briefed on the operation said that four days before the attack, all those participating were rounded up by Hamas commanders and isolated. Their electronic devices were confiscated and they had no contact with the outside world, something that could help explain why Israel was blindsided. On Oct. 7, several hours before launching the operation, this person said, Hamas commanders informed the attackers that they would be invading Israel on speedboats, on paragliders and over land by breaking through the barbed wire fence along the territory’s border using tractors.
This account of how the attack was carried out could not be independently verified.
In retrospect, some warning signs that Israel missed may now be more apparent.
In September, Israeli intelligence officials told The New York Times that they had intelligence suggesting Mr. Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, had ordered a wide campaign against Israel including targeting its citizens abroad, conducting sabotage inside its borders, and smuggling sophisticated weapons to the Palestinians to ignite a civil war in the West Bank.
That was in retaliation for shadow war operations conducted by Israel in Iran, they said.
It was not the only talk of broad action. In various meetings of Iran’s proxy militias, several attendees said, the emphasis from leaders was that it was time to take advantage of Israel’s seething internal divisions over the judicial overhaul pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right coalition.
In the meeting Mr. Nasrallah held in March, he told militants to prepare for a war on a scale that would mark a turning point in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict (though it is unclear whether he had last week’s attack in mind).
Similarly, in audio reviewed by The Times of an April discussion among members of the Revolutionary Guards, including those involved with proxies in the region, a speaker said, “The message that is being communicated from Iran these days to the resistance is that we showcase a military maneuver to make the Zionist regime understand it is surrounded from every side.”
Even before the Hamas attack, some Israeli intelligence officials said that in hindsight, they regretted their support for Israeli targeted killings in Iran and operations to sabotage its nuclear and military facilities, because they had not been a significant deterrent to either Iran’s nuclear program or its regional activities. In fact, they had put Iran and Israel on a path of direct confrontation, one of the officials said.
On Oct. 3, four days before Hamas launched its attack on southern Israel, Mr. Khamenei’s official account in Farsi posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, that said: “Israel will be gone.”
The planners of the terror attack on Israel most certainly knew that it carried the risk of igniting a wider regional war. But the parties have long wanted to avenge an accumulation of grievances — from Israeli airstrikes on Gaza and Syria, to the long blockade of Gaza, to the covert war against Iran — amid a long-held collective determination to destroy Israel.
They may also have hoped to force Israel into major concessions, like lifting the blockade or keeping Israeli forces from entering the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City — one of Islam’s holiest sites.
Hamas named its operation against Israel “The Aqsa Flood.”

Israel mobilized 300,000 reservists amid signs that it could be preparing for a major ground invasion of Gaza, and it bombed hundreds of sites, including mosques and a marketplace.
Israel ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip on Monday as it retaliated for the largest and deadliest incursion into its territory in decades, while Hamas threatened to respond to the Israeli bombing campaign by executing civilians its fighters took hostage in Israel.
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant of Israel said that “no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel” would be allowed into Gaza, the crowded and impoverished coastal territory that is already under a 16-year blockade by Israel and Egypt. Israeli warplanes struck hundreds of sites in Gaza, which is controlled by the militant group Hamas, including mosques and a marketplace, while Israeli troops battled to regain control of towns overrun on Saturday by Hamas gunmen.
More than 900 people have been killed in Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said. More than 2,600 have been wounded since the incursion began early Saturday, and Hamas gunmen were holding about 150 hostages, the Israeli government said. The spokesman for Hamas’s military wing, Abu Obeida, said the group would execute a civilian hostage every time an airstrike hit Gazans “in their homes without warning.”
At least 687 Palestinians were killed and at least 3,726 injured, the authorities in Gaza said. The death toll is believed to include not only the casualties in Gaza, but also some of the assailants who were killed in the attack on Israel, though it was not immediately clear how many.
Israel mobilized 300,000 military reservists, an enormous number for a country of 9 million people, amid signs that it could be preparing for a major ground invasion of Gaza and the possible opening of another front against the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah in the north.
In a televised address on Monday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has warned of a long war ahead, vowed to “eliminate” Hamas. Mr. Netanyahu, who leads the most right-wing government in his nation’s history, called on the opposition to “immediately establish a national emergency government without preconditions.”
Lt. Col. Richard Hecht of the Israel Defense Forces told reporters on Monday that the next phase of fighting would not resemble recent conflicts with Gaza, in which Palestinian groups fired rockets but claimed relatively few casualties, and Israel would respond primarily with airstrikes. “We are in a different game here,” he said. “We are at war with Hamas.”
A stunned disbelief enveloped Israel, which appeared to have been caught entirely by surprise by the attack and had gone 50 years without enduring an assault on this scale or with so many casualties. Adding to the shock were the mass hostage-takings and the fact that fighting on Israeli soil continued into a third day. Families were watching men and women who had finished their mandatory military service being called back to duty, while the names of the dead scrolled across television screens.
An Israeli airstrike on Monday devastated a busy open-air marketplace in northern Gaza’s Jabaliya refugee camp, where Gazans anticipating a long fight had flocked to stock up on food and other supplies. A Red Crescent paramedic, who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity, said 60 people were killed there.
Videos shared on social media and distributed by Palestinian news agencies showed bodies strewn amid the debris of what moments earlier had been stands selling produce and other goods. Broken concrete and twisted metal from the surrounding buildings filled the square, and people made their way through the debris, smoke and dust, looking for survivors.
“Is he dead? Is he dead?” a man was heard yelling in one video.
Israeli strikes also hit four mosques in the Shati refugee camp on Monday, according to Gaza authorities, toppling their domes and killing worshipers inside. Neighbors picked through the rubble of the Sousi mosque, where witnesses said boys had been playing soccer just outside when it was destroyed.
Israel’s military said it had carried out more than 500 airstrikes overnight, targeting operations centers of Hamas and another group, Islamic Jihad. It confirmed hitting several mosques, saying that they contained Hamas infrastructure or fighters.
The United Nations and Palestinian officials said that at least two hospitals and multiple homes had also been hit, and many Gazans said they had nowhere to go to escape the Israeli strikes.
President Biden said at least 11 U.S. citizens were confirmed killed in the Hamas attack, and an unknown number were unaccounted for. “While we are still working to confirm, we believe it is likely that American citizens may be among those being held by Hamas,” he said in a written statement.
He vowed to work with Israel “on every aspect of the hostage crisis,” including sharing intelligence and deploying experts.
Mr. Biden and the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy also released a statement late Monday condemning “Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism.”
Many other foreign nationals were reported dead, wounded or missing, including 12 Thais killed, 11 kidnapped and nine wounded, according to their government. France said two of its nationals were killed and 14 were unaccounted for.
Israel has asked the United States to supply it with more precision-guided munitions for its warplanes and more missiles for its Iron Dome air defense system, requests the Biden administration is working on, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. A senior Pentagon official said the United States was already accelerating shipments of such weapons.
More than 100 people were killed over the weekend in a Hamas assault on an Israeli kibbutz, Be’eri, said Moti Bukjin, a spokesman for the ZAKA relief organization, which was recovering bodies there on Monday. “It was horrible work. There were killed children there,” he said, adding that there were dozens of dead militants in the town as well.
At least 109 people were killed by gunmen who swarmed into a weekend music festival at a venue in Israel three miles from the Gaza border on Saturday. But ZAKA volunteers later reported recovering an estimated 260 bodies at the site of the rave, Mr. Bukjin said. Videos show panicked concertgoers fleeing south into the desert and more than 100 abandoned vehicles on the side of the road.
Hamas’s armed wing, the Al Qassam Brigades, said four Israelis were killed in one of the Israeli airstrikes, along with the Palestinian gunmen who were holding them captive, a claim that could not be independently verified.
A new barrage of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza injured seven people on Monday, officials said, while sirens blared in Jerusalem and across central Israel. Schools remained closed and flights in and out of the country were curtailed.
Israeli leaders are concerned that Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia allied with Iran, could enter the fight, and Israeli military units in the north are on high alert. Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006.
Fighting escalated on Monday on that front, along Israel’s northern frontier with Lebanon, with Islamic Jihad claiming responsibility for small cross-border attacks there, a day after Hezbollah fired on Israeli posts and Israeli forces fired back. Israel’s military said on Monday that it had struck three Hezbollah posts in Lebanon, and Hezbollah said that three of its fighters had been killed. The group later said it had carried out attacks on two Israeli military barracks, using guided missiles and mortars.
It was not clear what prompted the timing of the most audacious attack Hamas has ever launched on Israel. Hamas is backed by Iran, as is Islamic Jihad, and Tehran is eager to derail a possible diplomatic deal between its two regional archenemies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. The Iranian foreign ministry denied that its government had any role in the fighting. U.S. officials said that no evidence had emerged so far of Iranian involvement, but that Iran was complicit in the attack, given its years of support for Hamas.
Israel’s chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, declared on Monday that the army had regained control of border communities, though “there may still be terrorists in the area.” But a short time later the military said soldiers and armed militants were exchanging gunfire in Kfar Azza, an Israeli village near the border.
Colonel Hecht said in a news briefing on Monday that Israeli special forces troops were trying to dislodge militants from a civilian area.
“We thought by this morning we’d be in a better place,” he said.
Israeli rescue workers were still extracting the bodies of civilians who were killed in their homes by Hamas gunmen on Saturday.
Mr. Netanyahu warned local leaders in southern Israel to prepare for a long fight, his office said.
“I know you have been through tough and terrible things. What Hamas will go through will be tough and terrible,” he told them, according to his office. “We are already in the midst of a battle that has only just begun.”
The United Nations humanitarian agency said Israeli strikes had displaced 123,000 Gazans, and damaged water, sanitation and hygiene facilities affecting more than 400,000 people. The only power plant providing electricity to Gaza could run out of fuel in a few days, aid agencies have said.
In the north, Israel’s Home Front Command instructed the residents of 28 towns and villages near the border with Lebanon to go to bomb shelters and other protected spaces. The residents were told to take food, water, mattresses, and blankets, signaling that they may need to stay there for a while.
The Lebanese Army said Israeli planes and artillery struck near the towns of Dhayra and Aita al Shaab close to the border with Israel earlier on Monday. The military instructed Lebanese civilians “not to go to areas adjacent to the border for the sake of their safety.”

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is visiting the Middle East as the Israel-Palestinian conflict reaches a degree of violence not seen in many years.
Antony J. Blinken is in the middle of his most intense trip as the top American diplomat, traveling to at least seven countries across the Middle East in four days to shore up support for Israel as it wages war against Hamas.
During a whirlwind tour, at times guarded by security officers wearing body armor, the secretary of state broadcast several U.S. messages at once. He made clear that the United States fully supports Israel’s counterattack in response to Hamas’s cross-border incursion, which killed more than 1,300 people.
He sought to persuade Arab countries to limit their criticism — no easy task as devastating Israeli strikes have killed about 1,900 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.
Mr. Blinken and his top aides also spoke with their hosts about efforts to free hostages Hamas was holding in Gaza, including what U.S. officials say may be some American citizens abducted from Israel on Saturday. And he tried to ensure that the conflict did not widen to draw in other enemies of Israel, such as Iran or the Lebanon-based militia Hezbollah.
Mr. Blinken landed in Israel on Thursday, less than one week after Hamas gunmen attacked towns in the southern part of the country.
Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III arrived in Tel Aviv a day later, with a similar message of support.
After a swing through Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia on Friday, Mr. Blinken plans to carry on to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
His travels come as the Israel-Palestinian conflict reaches a degree of violence not seen in many years and poses myriad new challenges for President Biden’s foreign policy, which has been focused on defending Ukraine and countering Chinese power.
Mr. Blinken’s travels reflected a tension for the Biden administration. Likening the atrocities committed by Hamas to those of the Islamic State, Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken aim to send a clear message that the United States largely supports Israel’s actions in Gaza and that countries in the region should do the same.
“Israel has both the right and even the obligation to defend its people,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference in Doha, Qatar. “What Israel is doing is not retaliation. What Israel is doing is defending the lives of its people,” and, he added, “trying to make sure that this cannot happen again.”
“Imagine if this happened in the United States,” he said.
At the same time, Mr. Blinken signaled, albeit more gently and in terms that can sound pro forma, some concern about the potential impact on Gaza’s largely impoverished Palestinian population of two million.
“But at the same time,” he said in Doha, “the way Israel does this matters.” Mr. Blinken said he had spoken with Israeli officials about the need to ensure civilians were not harmed.
He then added that Hamas “uses civilians as human shields” — a line that suggests an understanding that Israeli attacks will necessarily involve many innocent casualties.
Biden administration officials understand that although Israel has been showered with international good will this week, criticism will rise among Americans and citizens of other countries as it carries out what it says will be a long military offensive in Gaza.
Even so, Mr. Blinken signaled in his travels that the Biden administration would have a high tolerance for whatever results from Israel’s military response.
During his first stop, at a military base in Tel Aviv where diplomatic security officials who typically wear suits donned camouflage military gear, Mr. Blinken delivered the message directly to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel: “We will always be there by your side.”
“Too often in the past, leaders have equivocated in the face of terrorist attacks against Israel and its people,” Mr. Blinken said. “This is — this must be — a moment for moral clarity.”
Mr. Blinken is carrying that message to the Arab nations he is visiting through Sunday. Of those countries, only the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have explicitly condemned Hamas for its attacks.
Qatar’s first statement after the attacks said Israel was “solely responsible” for the violence against its citizens because of its blockade of Gaza. Saudi Arabia issued a statement making a similar case.
In a statement on Friday, the government of Jordan said the country’s monarch, King Abdullah, had pressed Mr. Blinken on the need for humanitarian corridors and aid into Gaza, and “warned of inflicting collective punishment against Gaza residents.” It contained no condemnation of Hamas.
Such talk highlights the challenges for Mr. Blinken among the Arab nations. But it also belies the private unease that many Arab leaders have with Hamas, said Dennis Ross, who was a Middle East adviser to several presidents and now is with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Mr. Blinken’s challenge, he said, “is to remind everybody that Hamas can’t be seen as winning. Hamas must be seen as decisively losing.”
“Everyone he sees in private, they are going to agree,” Mr. Ross said.
Mr. Blinken has also pursued two other key goals on his trip.
One is for nations in contact with Hezbollah and Iran to tell them not to join the war. The other is for countries that have influence with Hamas to help win the release of the 150 or so hostages taken on Saturday. Mr. Blinken was accompanied on his trip by Steve Gillen, the U.S. deputy special envoy for hostage affairs, who remained in Israel after his departure.
Mr. Biden joined a call on Friday with Mr. Gillen’s boss, Roger Carstens, the special envoy for hostage affairs, and other top officials including the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, White House officials said.
Qatar is a crucial interlocutor, making Mr. Blinken’s stop there especially sensitive. Officials in Doha speak to Iran, host offices for leaders of Hamas and have mediated hostage and prisoner releases in the Middle East and Afghanistan.
“I’m grateful for the urgency that Qatar is bringing to this effort,” Mr. Blinken said at a news conference on Friday in Doha with the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.
Asked by a reporter whether his government would continue to allow Hamas to operate in Doha, a subject of sharp criticism from supporters of Israel, Mr. Al Thani called the office useful “as a way of communicating and of bringing peace and calm to the region.”
In language clearly directed at Israel, Mr. Al Thani also said that Qatar opposes “collective punishment” and “hitting and targeting civilians, women and children.”
In Qatar, Mr. Blinken did not publicly address the subject of Hamas’s presence in the country, though he did say in general terms that, after Saturday’s “unconscionable” attacks, “there can be no more business as usual with Hamas.”
“You can expect that he was probably much more blunt in private,” Mr. Ross said.
In a planned stop in Saudi Arabia’s capital of Riyadh, Mr. Blinken is expected to discuss how the conflict could affect months of negotiations in search of an agreement that might officially normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The deal would include U.S. concessions to Riyadh such as a security agreement.
Since the Hamas attacks and the start of Israel’s military campaign against Palestinians, Saudi officials have adopted a wait-and-see posture before moving forward with the normalization talks. John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters on Friday that the United States still supported a Saudi-Israel agreement.
“But obviously, these are sovereign nations,” he added. “They get to decide for themselves at what pace they’re willing to move, under what conditions — and certainly the degree to which they want to continue that effort.”
During his visit to Israel, Mr. Austin met with Israeli leaders and also reaffirmed U.S. support for their new offensive against Hamas.
Mr. Austin arrived from Brussels, where he was attending a NATO defense ministers meeting. He got a firsthand look at some of the weapons and security aid that the Biden administration has rushed to Israel after last weekend’s attack. A second shipment of arms arrived on Friday, Israeli officials said.
Asked about the likelihood of civilian casualties in Gaza as Israeli troops prepare to mount a major ground assault there, Mr. Austin said Israel has the right to defend itself. He added that he has worked with Israeli forces over the years, when he was a top Army general.
“They are professional, they are disciplined and they are focused on the right things,” he told reporters after meeting for nearly two hours with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, and the Israeli war cabinet.

One Million Palestinians Are Displaced in Exodus From North Gaza

Nearly one million displaced Gazans are facing shortages of food, clean water and shelter, while Americans remain trapped in the enclave. 
  As Israeli troops massed near the border with Gaza on Saturday, readying tanks and ammunition in dusty staging grounds, fears of an imminent ground invasion created an exodus from northern Gaza amid a dire scarcity in the territory of water and other essentials. The United Nations said that nearly one million Gazans had fled their homes.
  In Israel, the military said Saturday it would continue to expand operations to include ''an integrated and coordinated attack from the air, sea and land.'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israeli soldiers readying for attack, and video of the Saturday afternoon encounter showed Mr. Netanyahu asking soldiers, ''Are you ready for what comes next?''
  Across the border, there were scenes of residents fleeing in cars, in horse-drawn carriages and on foot. Evacuees fleeing the anticipated invasion of northern Gaza struggled to find food, water and shelter in the south. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations agency dedicated to Palestinians, said an electricity blackout and a lack of drinking water had become ''a matter of life or death.'' Displaced families crammed into schools and hospitals while others crowded into the houses of friends and family.
  And as the United States, Egypt and Israel discussed terms for a safe passage of U.S. citizens out of the territory, the vast majority of the more than two million residents in Gaza, nearly half of them under 18, were trapped, some sleeping in cars, on chairs and on the ground, even as Israeli airstrikes continued.
  The Gazan authorities said Israel was responsible for an explosion Friday that killed at least 70 people traveling in a convoy of vehicles fleeing south. Israel said it was looking into the matter.
  Israel stepped up its efforts to persuade hundreds of thousands of Palestinian civilians to leave northern Gaza. The Israeli military said it had showered the population with warnings. It released a video on Saturday of fluttering pieces of paper dropped from the sky, pamphlets that warned that Gaza City had become a ''battle zone.''
  ''You must evacuate your home immediately and go south of Wadi Gaza,'' the pamphlet said, referring to a strip of wetlands that roughly divides the territory in half.
  Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, warned of ''challenging weeks'' ahead as the military operation escalated. The goal, he said, was ''the defeat of Hamas and the elimination of its leaders.''
  As of Saturday, it had been one week since Hamas, the armed group that controls Gaza, attacked Israel, an operation that appears to have been planned over many months and that targeted specific Israeli military bases and residential neighborhoods along the border with Gaza, as well as an open-air music festival. The attacks killed more than 1,300 people, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history and the worst mass killing of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.
  The fate of more than 150 hostages that Hamas seized during the incursion remained unclear.
  On Friday, the Israeli military conducted limited raids in and out of Gaza, the first time troops had entered the territory since the military began its relentless bombardments.  Palestinian militants have fired more than 5,500 rockets into Israel since the fighting erupted, the Israeli military said.
  While there was no sign that Gaza residents would be allowed to leave the blockaded territory into neighboring Egypt, the Israeli and Egyptian governments held talks over plans  allow American citizens trapped in Gaza to cross into Egypt, a senior State Department official said. 
  Israel's top military and political leaders found themselves caught between a deeply wounded nation's desire for reprisal and calls for restraint, including from some of the country's closest allies.
  The United States has sent weapons to Israel in the past week and President Biden on Friday called Hamas ''pure evil.'' A day after Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III declared it was a ''time for resolve, not revenge,'' Mr. Biden delivered a similar message in a call to Mr. Netanyahu, repeating his outrage at Hamas atrocities and affirming ''support for all efforts to protect civilians,'' according to a White House statement.
  The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, on Saturday continued his frenetic travels across the Middle East, a four-day trip that includes stops in Israel, Jordan, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Mr. Blinken also called Wang Yi, China's top foreign policy official, on Saturday to ask for the Chinese government's help in ensuring that other actors in the region do not get involved in the Israel-Hamas war, a State Department spokesman told reporters.
  In Mr. Blinken's meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the Saudi minister of foreign affairs, stressed the importance of keeping civilians safe. ''It's important, I think, that we all condemn the targeting of civilians in any form at any time,'' the prince said at the start of their meeting, adding that ''the priority now has to be to stop further civilian suffering.''
  Retaliation by Israel since the Hamas attacks has imposed a heavy toll. Palestinian officials say 2,228 people have been killed in Gaza in the past week and that more than 8,744 have been injured.
  Mr. Lazzarini, who leads the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, said Saturday that no humanitarian supplies had been allowed into Gaza for the past week.
  ''I appeal for the siege on humanitarian assistance to be lifted now,'' he said in a statement. Mr. Lazzarini said the U.N. had moved its operations to the southern portion of Gaza.
  The territory's water plant and public water networks had stopped working, he said, forcing residents to drink dirty water from wells, increasing risks of waterborne diseases.
  Aid convoys from Egypt to Gaza have been held up by disagreements over how and where the convoys should be screened for weapons, according to a senior diplomat familiar with the discussions. Egypt on Saturday was refusing to allow foreigners to leave Gaza until aid was allowed in, the diplomat added.
  ''It's a struggle for life here,'' said a Gaza resident, Zeina Ghanem, speaking on Saturday morning from a training center in southern Gaza run by the United Nations. ''There's no food. There's no water. There's no sleep.''
  Just over the border, in Israel, the tanks and armored vehicles stirred up pillars of sand with every small maneuver. Israeli flags flew from their turrets. 
  Shai Levy, 37, a tank driver from Jerusalem, said his mission was clear. ''To restore honor to Israel,'' said Mr. Levy, who in civilian life is a rabbi and teaches in a seminary. 
  ''The citizens are relying on us to defeat Hamas and remove the threat from Gaza once and for all,'' he said.
  The war is being waged in what, in global terms, are slivers of land. But the massacres, the missile strikes and the fighting of the last week have reverberated around the world. JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said Friday that the conflict may have ushered in ''the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,'' warning of ''far-reaching impacts on energy and food markets, global trade and geopolitical relationships.''
  Already, scores of citizens from countries outside the Middle East have been killed in the conflict.
  Twenty-nine Americans died in the attacks by Hamas in Israel, U.S. officials said. France's foreign ministry said Saturday that 17 French citizens were confirmed to have been killed. Twenty-four Thais have been killed and 13 have been wounded, Thailand's Foreign Ministry said Saturday. The dead include citizens of Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Brazil, Britain, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Ireland, Nepal, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Switzerland, Ukraine and Turkey.
  The United Nations reported last week that 11 of its workers had been killed in Israeli airstrikes. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said five of its members had been killed in the conflict.
  The Israeli army said Saturday it was investigating the death of Issam Abdullah, a Reuters journalist who was killed on Friday night amid escalating clashes on Lebanon's southern border with Israel. Six other journalists were injured in the incident.
  There was a sense of urgency in northern Gaza on Saturday as Israel's invasion loomed. Mohammed Ziara, a 30-year-old painter, was scrambling to leave and head south with his wife and two children. ''There is no time,'' he said by phone, his voice trembling.

Body


After Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Israel has been besieging and bombarding the Gaza Strip, worsening a humanitarian crisis.
On Oct. 7, Hamas led a surprise attack on towns, a music festival, army bases and other locations in Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages, including children, according to the Israeli government.
Israeli officials vowed to destroy Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Israel and other countries. Israel has since besieged Gaza in one of the most intense bombing campaigns of this century, and launched a ground invasion.
More than 11,000 Palestinians, including more than 4,600 children, have been killed since the Israeli campaign began, according to Gaza’s health ministry. 
The violence, its fallout and the humanitarian crisis afflicting Gazan civilians have shaken the region and the world.
Here’s what to know:
What happened during the Hamas attack?
Early on Oct. 7, Hamas fired volleys of rockets that struck as far away as Tel Aviv and the outskirts of Jerusalem. The attackers also infiltrated border communities and army bases, as well as an outdoor music festival, opening fire on men, women and children. It took days for Israeli forces to regain control after the attack.
Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups also took about 240 civilians and soldiers hostage. Four have since been released.
How has Israel responded?
After the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, the Israeli military soon began a siege to block food, water, and fuel from entering the territory, and it launched a ground invasion on Oct. 27. Israeli troops encircled Gaza City on Nov. 7, effectively splitting control of the strip in half. On Nov. 17, Israel signaled that it was preparing to expand military operations into southern Gaza, where Palestinians had been told to evacuate.
More than one million Palestinians have been displaced following Israel’s warnings for civilians to leave northern Gaza, aid workers say. Many Gazans say no part of the enclave is safe.
Israel says Hamas uses civilian structures, including hospitals, as bases for military operations in violation of international law; areas including medical centers, schools, mosques and residential locations have been struck under Israel’s bombardment. Palestinians and some international observers have accused Israel of breaking the law with a disproportionate military response.
On Nov. 15, the Israeli military stormed Gaza’s largest hospital, Al-Shifa, and said it discovered weapons and other evidence to support its assertions that Hamas operated in a network of tunnels under the complex. Senior U.S. officials have backed Israel, though the Israeli military has yet to show incontrovertible proof of a vast Hamas tunnel network. Hamas and hospital officials had denied the accusations.
Almost two days after Israel began its raid of Al-Shifa, New York Times journalists were taken on a controlled tour of the complex by Israeli military officials, and saw a shaft on the hospital grounds. Electrical wiring was visible inside, along with a metal staircase, but it was unclear how deep the shaft was or where it led.
As conditions have worsened for civilians in Gaza, Israel’s campaign has drawn increasing outcries from the United Nations, aid organizations and much of the world.
Without challenging Israel’s right to defend itself, the Biden administration has repeatedly called for “humanitarian pauses” to protect Palestinian civilians and allow the delivery of desperately needed aid. 
What is the situation in Gaza?
After more than a month of war, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has grown increasingly dire, leaving Gazans with severely limited access to food, clean water and medical care. The United Nations has warned that the entire territory is at risk of starvation amid mass internal displacement. Thousands of children, who make up nearly half of Gaza’s population, have been killed, according to health officials.
After weeks of desperate fuel shortages that put hospitals on the verge of collapse, Israel agreed on Nov. 17 to the entry of two tankers of fuel into Gaza each day to operate desalination and sewage plants. 
Before Israel’s raid of Al-Shifa, the hospital complex had been struggling to treat patients, with operations limited by a dearth of supplies, including water, medicine and oxygen. Medical workers at other hospitals have described similar scenes of operations at the verge of collapse.  
Violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has also sharply escalated since Oct. 7. About 200 Palestinians have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces and in escalating settler attacks, local officials say. 
What happened with the hostages?
Freeing the 240 hostages abducted by Hamas on Oct. 7 has been one of Israel’s two main goals of the war, in addition to destroying Hamas.
Since Oct. 7, Hamas has released four Israeli hostages, while Israeli troops rescued a 19-year-old Israeli soldier in October. Hamas has published some videos of hostages on social media, which Israel has called psychological terrorism.
Following Israel’s raid of the Al-Shifa hospital, Israeli soldiers said they found the bodies of two Israeli hostages nearby, which they called an indication that Hamas used the complex for military operations.
Negotiations for a deal that would have exchanged 50 women and children captives with roughly the same number of Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons had been underway, according to Israeli officials. 
How have other leaders reacted?
In the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks, many world leaders condemned Hamas and affirmed their support for Israel. President Biden visited to show solidarity, as did the leaders of Britain, France and Germany.
But the strong support for Israel has since been tempered by calls for restraint from its allies, while protesters across the world have been calling for a cease-fire. Aid groups are warning about the spiraling crisis in Gaza.
On Nov. 16, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution calling for days-long humanitarian pauses to the fighting in Gaza. 
António Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations, is among the leaders who has called for a humanitarian cease-fire. 
Leaders of dozens of Arab and Muslim nations convened in Saudi Arabia in mid-November. They also called for a cease-fire and avoided blaming Hamas, but those with ties to Israel have not cut off relations.
Is a broader conflict possible?
The war in Gaza is straining relations between Israel and its immediate neighbors, jeopardizing months of U.S. diplomacy to push Saudi Arabia to normalize ties with Israel, leading to protests across the Middle East and the world and stoking fears of a broader regional conflict.
President Biden has sought to prevent the war between Israel and Hamas from spilling over into a fight with Iran and its proxies in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. The Pentagon sent two aircraft carriers and dozens of extra warplanes to the region to make this point.
Since the Oct. 7 attacks, the Israeli army has engaged in almost daily clashes with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group allied with Hamas and backed by Iran. Israel’s military also has responded to fire from Syria.
What happens after the war?
The Palestinian Authority, which controls parts of the West Bank, said on Nov. 9 it would be open to a role overseeing a post-Hamas Gaza as long as the Biden administration commits to a two-state solution to end the war, according to a top Palestinian official. The head of the authority, President Mahmoud Abbas, met with U.S. officials in Ramallah on Nov. 15, urging them to pressure Israel to stop the war, speed up humanitarian aid and crack down on violence in the West Bank.
But Mr. Netanyahu said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Nov. 12 that his postwar vision would not include the Palestinian Authority in the near term. Earlier, he had said that Israel would indefinitely “have the overall security responsibility” of the enclave, though he seemed to stop short of suggesting a full re-occupation of Gaza.
His statement was at odds with the postwar plan that Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested on Nov. 8, in which Gaza would be unified with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.

Body


We look at the evidence for who is responsible.
Last month, a few days after the explosion at Al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, I walked you through the debate over who was responsible. At the time, there wasn’t much evidence that outsiders could assess on their own. The dispute revolved around competing claims from Israel and Hamas.
But more evidence has since emerged. In today’s newsletter, I’ll explain it.
The hospital explosion is important in its own right: It was the biggest news story in the world for days and sparked protests across the Middle East. The explosion also has a larger significance: It offers clues about how to judge the claims about civilian casualties that are central to Hamas’s war message.
My colleague Julian Barnes, who covers intelligence from Washington, describes the explosion evidence as falling into four categories — akin to four legs of a stool. Let’s look at each of them:
1. Videos of the air
The most complicated part of the evidence involves the various cameras that captured the sky above Gaza on the night of Oct. 17.
The Associated Press, CNN and The Wall Street Journal each analyzed one set of footage and concluded that a malfunctioning rocket from Gaza — presumably from Palestinian fighters — caused the explosion. Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials have made the same argument.
But an examination by The New York Times’s Visual Investigations team exposed flaws in the footage analysis. Times reporters used additional cameras to conclude that the projectile actually came from Israel — and did not land near the hospital, which means it couldn’t have caused the explosion. At least two independent analysts, as well as The Washington Post, agree. CNN, similarly, has since published a new article withdrawing and updating its original finding.
The Post’s analysis also explains that a separate video does show a barrage of rockets from Gaza, headed toward the hospital, just before the explosion. One of them could have been “a stray rocket launched by a Palestinian armed group,” The Post wrote. The Times analysis notes that Palestinian and Israeli forces were each firing weapons in the area around the time of the explosion.
Bottom line: The video evidence remains murky.
2. Videos of the ground
Israeli airstrikes tend to leave fingerprints. The bombs typically weigh 2,000 pounds and create huge craters. Shrapnel is extensive. Buildings are destroyed.
None of these descriptions fit the hospital explosion, according to videos and photos. The hole in the ground resembles a large pothole. Cars are burned out, not flattened. Nearby buildings show little structural damage, and there is little shrapnel. “The damage is too light to be from a 2,000-pound bomb,” Julian says.
This pattern doesn’t prove the explosion’s source was Palestinian; Israel does use smaller munitions, such as howitzer shells. But the explosion appears consistent with the rockets that Palestinian groups were launching toward Israel that night. One possibility is that the damage was limited because it came mostly from the leaking fuel of a malfunctioned rocket, ignited on impact, rather than from the explosion of the rocket head.
Bottom line: The scene after the explosion is inconsistent with that of a typical Israeli airstrike.
3. Hamas’s case
Hamas, not Israel, controls the area around the hospital and has had more than two weeks to scour it for the evidence, such as shrapnel, that even a smaller Israeli weapon likely would have left. “The evidence of an Israeli airstrike wouldn’t simply evaporate into the night,” Julian said. (In Ukraine, physical evidence is one way that Times reporters solved the mystery of a September explosion.)
Yet Hamas has produced no signs of an Israeli airstrike, as my colleagues Patrick Kingsley and Aaron Boxerman have explained. Instead, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, said, “The missile has dissolved like salt in the water.”
Bottom line: Hamas’s failure to produce evidence suggests the group may not want outsiders to see it.
4. The tapes
Israel has released the recording of what it says is an Oct. 17 conversation in which one Hamas member tells another that a Palestinian rocket caused the explosion. “It’s from us?” one asks. “It looks like it,” the other replies.
Israel has also shared at least three similar taped conversations with the U.S., and U.S. officials have judged them to be genuine.
Bottom line: The conversations are relevant evidence, but they’re not proof. It’s possible that Hamas fighters were themselves confused.
The full picture
I try to avoid the journalistic sin known as bothsidesism when information favors one version of events over another. And while much about the hospital explosion remains unclear, the available evidence points toward a Palestinian rocket, not an Israeli airstrike, as the more likely cause.
“One of the legs of the stool — the videos of a rocket exploding in the sky — now looks a lot weaker than it did,” Julian said. “But the other pieces of evidence remain in place. And the overall conclusion of the American intelligence agencies appears sound: It was a malfunctioning Palestinian rocket that most likely hit the hospital.”
This evidence, in turn, suggests that the Gaza Ministry of Health, controlled by Hamas, has deliberately told the world a false story. U.S. officials believe that the health ministry also inflated the toll when it announced 500 deaths; the actual number appears to be closer to 100.
This episode doesn’t mean that Gazan officials always mislead or that Israeli officials always tell the truth. Even in this case, for example, Israeli officials have cited video evidence that Times reporting suggests does not support their argument. Both sides deserve continued scrutiny.
But the hospital explosion offers reason to apply particular skepticism to Hamas’s claims about civilian deaths — which are an undeniable problem in this war. Hamas’s record on the war’s most closely watched incident does not look good.
If more evidence becomes available, I will cover it in a future newsletter.
More on the War
Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, arrived in Tel Aviv to urge Israel’s government to pause the fighting to free hostages and distribute humanitarian aid.
The Israeli military said that its soldiers, who have encircled Gaza City, were battling “face to face” with Hamas fighters. These maps show where Israel is advancing.
The U.N. human rights agency said it had “serious concerns” that recent airstrikes on the Jabaliya area could constitute a war crime; Israel rejected that, arguing that Hamas bears responsibility for civilian deaths because it hides its commanders among everyday Gazans.
A Hamas official vowed more attacks against Israel similar to those of Oct. 7.

With President Biden about to arrive in Israel, Palestinians and Israelis blamed each other for the explosion at a  hospital, where people had sought shelter from Israeli bombing.
An explosion killed hundreds of people on Tuesday at a hospital in Gaza City that was packed with people sheltering there, Gazan officials said, as Palestinians and Israelis blamed each other for a tragedy that inflamed the region just as President Biden was expected to arrive in Israel.
Hamas, the group that controls Gaza, said an Israeli airstrike had caused the blast at the Ahli Arab Hospital. Hours later, Israeli officials said that one of the rockets fired at Israel by Palestinian militants had failed shortly after launch, causing what could be the deadliest single incident of the 10-day-old war.
Photos and videos posted online and verified by The New York Times showed bloodied and battered bodies, flames, grieving witnesses and the blankets, backpacks and mattresses of the dead and wounded littering the area around them. Ali Jadallah, a Palestinian photojournalist in Gaza City, said he watched as victims arrived at another hospital, ferried there in any available vehicle, most of them dead. Many of the bodies were not intact, he said.
A woman shared a video she recorded as she made her way through the hospital, asking, “Where am I supposed to go?”
The images, as well as Hamas’s immediate statements blaming Israel and the delay in Israeli denials, combined to fuel angry reactions across the Middle East, with large protests in Beirut and a crowd in Amman, Jordan, lighting a fire outside the Israeli embassy there.
Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited authority over the West Bank, cut short a trip to Jordan, where he was scheduled to meet with Mr. Biden. The foreign ministry of Saudi Arabia, which had been exploring establishing formal relations with Israel, blamed the massacre on “the forces of the Israeli occupation.”
The Israeli military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday night that the blast at the hospital had resulted from a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas. Islamic Jihad denied the allegation.
In the past, rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups, including Islamic Jihad, have occasionally malfunctioned and hit civilian neighborhoods.
A spokeswoman for the Gazan health ministry put the toll at 500 or more dead, which the ministry later changed to “hundreds.” No figure could be confirmed independently, but images from the hospital, which is run by the Anglican Church, and witness accounts made clear that it was high.
The disaster immediately raised the stakes for Mr. Biden, who is expected to arrive on Wednesday in Israel on a trip to meet with regional leaders in an attempt to de-escalate the crisis. He was scheduled to continue on to Amman to meet with the leaders of Jordan and Egypt, as well as Mr. Abbas, but that meeting was called off late Tuesday.
Shortly before taking off for Israel on Air Force One, Mr. Biden said he was “outraged and deeply saddened by the explosion at the Al Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza, and the terrible loss of life that resulted.” He said he had directed his national security team to look into what had happened.
Israeli planes have been pummeling Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s Oct. 7 massacre and kidnapping of Israelis. The bombing campaign and Israel’s directive to evacuate northern Gaza, including Gaza City, have displaced hundreds of thousands of people, killed or wounded thousands, and left people throughout the territory perilously low on water, food, fuel and medicine.
People who fled their homes were sleeping in streets, fights were breaking out over food, and hospitals were increasingly unable to care for a flood of wounded patients. More than a week of international talks have yielded no agreement to allow vital supplies into the territory, to let some people exit, or to create safe zones for civilians within Gaza, where more than 2 million people are trapped in worsening conditions.
Aid and human rights groups have stepped up criticism of the Israeli bombing and the instruction to evacuate. Israeli officials do not deny striking residential buildings and mosques, or killing and injuring noncombatants, but they insist that they are targeting Hamas’s officials, weapons caches, tunnels and safe houses, all deeply intertwined with Gazan civilian infrastructure.
Before the hospital explosion in Gaza City, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights’s office in a statement on Tuesday cited “daily indications of violations of the laws of war and international human rights law” in Israel’s campaign in Gaza, and said telling people to evacuate northern Gaza may be considered a forcible transfer of a population, itself a violation of international law.
More than 600,000 people have fled northern Gaza — over half the area’s population — the United Nations said on Tuesday, after Israel told Gazans to go south for their safety as it bombed and prepared for a possible ground invasion. But evacuation has been no guarantee of safety, with airstrikes killing people in the south and on the roads heading to it.
Mohammad Ayoub, 57, and his family fled northern Gaza with only a few personal items, arriving in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, only to find it under attack, too. “There’s constant bombing, even in these areas they say are safe,” Mr. Ayoub said. “But there are no more safe places in Gaza.”
The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it had stepped up bombing in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, in strikes that Gaza officials said killed 80 people overnight. Maj. Nir Dinar, a spokesman for the military, said Israel sought to avoid civilian casualties but that Hamas fighters were hiding among Palestinian civilians, and that southern Gaza — while not entirely safe — remained safer than the north.
Hamas and Israel have gone to war several times before but never on this scale, and the conflict is a growing focus of international attention. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany went to Israel on Tuesday in a show of support for the country, and António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, is expected to go to the region on Thursday for meetings on the Israel-Gaza war.
Mr. Biden has called the Hamas attack “pure evil” and said repeatedly that Israel has a right to respond in its defense, while also signaling concern about the human toll.
Hamas’s assault made Oct. 7 the deadliest single day in Israel’s history, and it was the worst breach of the nation’s security since the 1973 Yom Kippur war began with a surprise attack by Egypt, Syria and several other states. In a highly planned assault, thousands of Hamas militants broke through the border fence in multiple locations and poured into Israel, overrunning towns, military bases and a music festival, killing about 1,400 people — mostly civilians, and a number of them visiting foreigners — and taking about 200 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel has retaliated for the attack with the most intense bombing campaign it has ever waged against Hamas, determined to wipe out the fighting ability of an organization dedicated to destroying Israel. Mr. Netanyahu declared last week that “every Hamas member is a dead man.”
The bombing had killed more than 2,800 people in Gaza, officials there said on Monday. The U.N. human rights commissioner’s office said the dead have included at least 14 U.N. workers, 28 medical workers and 11 journalists. Gaza officials said that as many as 1,200 other people may still be under the rubble, as rescue workers struggle to find them.
Late on Monday, Hamas released a video of a 21-year-old Israeli woman it was holding, and the video became a source of hope and anguish for her family and those of other hostages. The group has claimed that the Israeli bombing has killed a number of the hostages, along with the Hamas fighters holding them.
A Hamas official said last week that the group would kill a hostage each time Israel bombed a home in Gaza, but there has been no sign that it has followed through on that threat.
In southern Gaza, people are spending their days scrounging for food and water, and spending nights crammed with other families into small apartments, or sleeping in cars or on the pavement. Some of them say conditions are so dire they are considering returning to their homes in the north, despite the lethal risks. With internet and cellphone service breaking down under the bombing, they are finding it steadily harder to get information about where to go, or how to get there.
“Today is worse than all the previous bad days,” Dr. Mohamed Zaqout, the general manager of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, said Tuesday. “With many displaced from the north, more people share the same homes and thus there are more casualties in each strike.”
The bombing has cut off most electricity, and emergency generators have run out of fuel at hospitals, shelters, water pumping stations and desalination plants. Hospitals “have entered the stage of actual collapse due to power outages and fuel scarcity,” the Gazan health ministry said in a statement.
The World Health Organization warned that the water shortage and crowding would lead to unsanitary conditions, inviting outbreaks of disease.
Gaza’s only borders are with Israel and Egypt, which have imposed a partial blockade on the territory since Hamas took power there in 2007. Israel declared a “complete siege” after the Hamas incursion, sealing its border with Gaza and amassing troops and tanks along the boundary.
That leaves the Rafah crossing into Egypt the only potential portal for people to escape — including some 500 to 600 U.S. citizens and permanent residents — and supplies to enter. But reports of imminent deals to open that door and let aid through have all proved unfounded.

Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched one of the broadest incursions into Israeli territory in 50 years. Israel has retaliated with massive airstrikes.
Days after hundreds of Hamas terrorists from Gaza rampaged through border towns in a surprise assault that killed at least 1,300 Israelis, the region is bracing for further conflict. 
  In response to the shocking incursion, Israel has been pummeling the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, and the Palestinian Health Ministry has said nearly 1,800 Palestinians have been killed. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists and troops are now massing at the border, leading to speculation that Israel will soon launch a ground offensive.
  The talk of a ground incursion into Gaza has been accompanied by a demand from Israel that more than a million civilians move to the south of the territory, an order condemned by the United Nations amid fears that it could worsen the already desperate humanitarian situation. Panic and chaos gripped the region on Friday as people tried to adhere to the order, and dozens were killed by airstrikes as they fled.
  Hamas officials had urged Palestinians not to comply.
  In a region with a long history of conflict, fighting along Israel's northern border with Lebanon escalated. The Israeli military said it was using a drone to strike Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon. And Hezbollah, the Lebanese armed group, announced that it had targeted four separate Israeli locations. 
  Israelis have been left asking how their government, and their vaunted military and intelligence agencies could have been so unprepared for the complex assault. Compounding their fears, there has been no word of the fate of some 150 hostages taken in the assault.
  The situation is dire enough that some opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing allies agreed to join forces in an emergency government after months of acrimony over controversial judicial reforms that were tearing Israelis apart.
  Here's what you need to know about the Hamas attacks and Israel's response.
  How did Hamas carry out the attacks?
  Hamas began firing thousands of rockets on Saturday morning, striking targets as far away as Tel Aviv and the outskirts of Jerusalem, which rarely see any direct hits because of Israel's sophisticated Iron Dome missile defense system.
  About an hour after the first rocket attacks, Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel by land, sea and air.
  The attackers infiltrated 22 Israeli towns and army bases, and took civilians and soldiers hostage. Hamas assailants killed men, women and children, at home, strolling on the street or dancing at an outdoor festival. Dozens of foreigners, including Americans, were among the victims.
  What reasons did Hamas give?
  Muhammad Deif, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, said in a recorded message that the group had decided to launch an ''operation'' so that ''the enemy will understand that the time of their rampaging without accountability has ended.''
  He cited Israel's occupation of the West Bank, which it captured during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, recent Israeli police raids on the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, and the detention of thousands of Palestinians in Israeli jails.
  The Aqsa Mosque compound, revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount, is among the most deeply contested sites in the Holy Land.
  How has Israel responded so far?
  In addition to airstrikes on Gaza, the Israeli authorities announced a ''complete siege'' of the enclave. The Israeli defense minister, Yoav Gallant, vowed that ''no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel'' would be allowed into Gaza, which is overcrowded, impoverished, and was already struggling under a suffocating, 16-year blockade by Israel and often Egypt.
  The blockade restricts the import of goods, including electronic and computer equipment, that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving the territory. Israel said the airstrikes had destroyed centers that house Hamas militants.
  The airstrikes, deadlier and more widespread than in its past campaigns, have wiped out neighborhoods, crippled the medical system, and in conjunction with the order to evacuate, left hundreds of thousands of people with nowhere to go.
  Palestinian officials have said the strikes were indiscriminate and had hit hospitals and mosques. They added that the strikes -- some of which hit ambulances according to the United Nations -- were impeding efforts to pull people from the rubble. The tensions have spilled over into the West Bank. Several Palestinians were killed in sporadic confrontations with Israeli forces and West Bank settlers. Deadly violence had also broken out in East Jerusalem. 
  What was different about this Hamas attack?
  The relentless conflict between Israel and Palestinians has spanned two centuries. The fighting -- including in May 2021, when the Israeli police raided the Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which partly helped set off an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas -- has left thousands dead.
  The timing of Saturday's assault was notable, hitting Israel at one of the most difficult moments in its history. It came after months of anxiety about the cohesion of Israeli society and the readiness of its military.
  The attacks also came on the holiday of Simchat Torah, and nearly 50 years to the day since the Israeli authorities were caught off-guard when forces from Egypt and Syria invaded, beginning the Yom Kippur War.
  What happens now?
  Mr. Netanyahu said the offensive against Hamas would continue ''without reservation and without respite.''
  President Biden and some other world leaders have condemned Hamas -- which the United States classifies as a terrorist organization -- saying they support Israel and its right to defend itself.
  The United States pledged military aid to Israel, with the first shipment of weapons delivered on Tuesday. Mr. Biden called the Hamas attack ''pure, unadulterated evil'' and vowed the U.S. would stand with Israel.
  Arab nations, including Saudi Arabia, have called for de-escalation, but have avoided blaming Hamas, and there were anti-Israel protests across the Arab world on Friday.
  The conflict also jeopardizes a monthslong effort by Mr. Biden and his top aides to push Saudi Arabia to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel, its historical adversary.

Hamas Releases Two U.S. Hostages, a Mother and Daughter

Judith Raanan and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, were kidnapped from a kibbutz near the Gaza border during the Oct. 7 attacks.
Two Americans held captive in Gaza by Hamas, a woman and her teenage daughter, were released on Friday, nearly two weeks after they were taken hostage along with 200 others during terrorist raids in southern Israel that ignited a war, leaving thousands of people dead.
Hamas said it was freeing Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter, Natalie Raanan, 17, for “humanitarian reasons,” but did not elaborate. Their releases came after negotiations involving officials in Qatar, who served as mediators between the United States and Hamas, the Palestinian group that controls the Gaza Strip.
The women, dual American-Israeli citizens who live in Illinois, had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Nahal Oz during the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel that killed some 1,400 people, and taken back to the Gaza Strip. They were released to the International Committee of the Red Cross and then handed over to the Israel Defense Forces, who took them to be reunited with family at an Israeli military base, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Hamas still holds 10 other Americans hostage, according to the State Department, and President Biden vowed on Friday to make every effort to reunite their families.
“We will not stop until we get their loved ones home,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “I have no higher priority than the safety of Americans held hostage around the world.” He asked the public to respect the privacy of the Raanans “as they recover and heal.”
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference on Friday that “every hostage needs to be released and needs to be released now,” unconditionally.
Mr. Blinken said he could not discuss details of the negotiations to free Judith and Natalie Raanan. According to someone familiar with the negotiations, Hamas asked for nothing in return for their release.
Hamas, Mr. Biden and Mr. Blinken all noted the role played by the government of Qatar, a wealthy Persian Gulf emirate that allows Hamas leaders to live there in safety, and has often acted as a go-between to resolve conflicts between the group and Israel. Mr. Blinken said Qatar had provided “very important assistance” in the hostage negotiations.
A spokesman for Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, Majid Al-Ansari, said in a statement that the release of the hostages came after days of continuous talks. He said Qatar would continue its mediation.
“We hope these efforts will lead to the release of all civilian hostages from every nationality, with the ultimate aim of de-escalating the current crisis and restoring peace,” he said.
In a statement, Hamas said it had decided to work toward “closing the file” of the hostage issue, “should the appropriate security circumstances be provided.”
Ms. Raanan and her daughter went to Israel last month to celebrate the Jewish holidays and the 85th birthday of Judith’s mother at a kibbutz in the south of the country.
Judith Raanan was born in Israel and spent her early life there before settling in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Ill., where she raised a family. Natalie Raanan, who also lived in Israel as a child, graduated from a public high school in Deerfield, Ill., near Chicago.
Chavah Rochel Golden, a friend of Judith’s in Chicago, said that Judith had never forgotten her Israeli roots and that it was important to her that her daughter feel the same way.
“She was quite Israeli, whether she was here or there,” Ms. Golden said. “She missed being around Israelis. She felt at home with Israelis, and she missed that — the energy of Israel.”
On Friday, Rivka Benyihoun, another friend from Chicago, said she and her husband had been watching Israeli television for news of their friend.
“We are all embracing and crying together,” Ms. Benyihoun said. “I told my husband, ‘She’s a survivor. She’s going to make it.’”
Avi Zamir, Natalie’s uncle, said the family was overwhelmed with relief but was awaiting news of the women’s condition.
After receiving word of their release, Mr. Zamir called his son, a student at Deerfield High School outside Chicago, to share the news, and heard a classroom of suburban teenagers erupt in cheers.
“I can’t even tell you the voices of joy I heard over the phone,” he said. “It’s a joyful moment for all Americans right now.”
In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois said he was “incredibly relieved” that the Raanans were safe.
“I cannot wait to welcome them back home after demonstrating immense strength and bravery in the face of unthinkable terror,” Mr. Pritzker said.
The situation of the more than 200 other hostages remains unclear. Israel has not publicly identified them, but military officials have said they include older people and children. Hamas has said that Israel’s bombing campaign in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attack has killed a number of hostages, along with the Hamas militants holding them.
Most of the captives were taken from small Israeli towns near the border with Gaza; others were abducted from military bases or from an all-night music festival. They include civilians, soldiers, peace activists, grandparents and a 9-month-old baby.
It was not clear why the Raanans were released before others, how they were treated in captivity or what Hamas intends to do with the remaining hostages. In the days after the raid, a Hamas official said it would kill captives if Israel continued to bomb homes in Gaza, but later the group said it wanted to trade them for Hamas members who are imprisoned in Israel or elsewhere.
Hamas has also acknowledged that it does not have all the hostages; some are held by smaller groups that took part in the assault on Israel.
On Friday, Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, disputed Hamas’s claim that it had released the Raanans for humanitarian reasons. “This is actually a murderous terrorist organization that right now holds babies, children, women and elderly people hostage in the Gaza Strip,” he told reporters.
The issue of hostages has long been a deeply emotional one in Israel, as well as a tactic used in the past by Hamas and Hezbollah, the Shiite militant organization in Lebanon.
Hamas is believed to be holding two Israeli civilians who entered Gaza in 2014 on foot, as well as the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed during a war that year.
And in 2006, Hamas seized an Israel soldier, Gilad Shalit, and held him in Gaza for five years. He was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, many of whom had been convicted of killing Israelis in terrorist attacks.
That same year, Israel fought a monthlong war with Hezbollah in Lebanon after it kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid. The soldiers’ remains were returned to Israel in 2008 in exchange for five prisoners.
Shortly after the Oct. 7 attack, Hamas released video of a woman and two small children it said it had released at the Gaza border. But the woman, Avital Aladjem, told Israeli news media that she and the children had escaped shortly after crossing the border because their captors left them briefly alone. She said the children belonged to her neighbor, who was killed in the attack.
Earlier this week, Hamas released a short video of Mia Schem, 21, who was abducted during the Hamas assault on the music festival. In the video, she is shown with a bandaged arm and says that she has received medical treatment while in captivity. It is so far the only video the group has released of any of the hostages.
“At the moment I am in Gaza,” Ms. Schem says in the video, which was posted to Telegram channels affiliated with Hamas. “I just ask that I am returned as fast as possible to my family, to my parents, and to my siblings. Please get us out of here as quickly as possible.”

For a Risk-Averse Netanyahu, All-Out War Is Untried Ground

In his 15 years as Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has been seen as risk-averse, avoiding open-ended military engagements and peace initiatives.
Follow our live coverage on the Israel-Hamas war. 
  ''We are at war,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared after Hamas fighters carried out harrowing attacks on Israeli civilians.
  And Mr. Netanyahu has swiftly assumed the mantle of a wartime leader, rallying his people, mobilizing support on the world stage, assembling a war cabinet and massing the Israeli Army outside the Gaza Strip for what could be one of the largest, most perilous operations in its history.
  Yet Mr. Netanyahu is, in some ways, an unlikely leader for an Israel on the brink of war. In his 15 years as prime minister, he has steadfastly resisted major military entanglements, preferring targeted airstrikes or special operations. His reluctance had, until this past week, made him something of a contradiction: a bellicose-sounding leader who has shied away from all-out war.
  Despite years of warning about the threat from Iran, covert efforts to sabotage its nuclear program and even assassinations of Iranian scientists, Mr. Netanyahu never ordered a military strike on that country. It's a decision that relieved American officials, who urged him against doing it, even as it reinforced a view among some in the Obama administration that the Israeli leader lacked courage.
  At home, Mr. Netanyahu has presented himself as an unflinching guarantor of Israel's security, less by going into battle than by managing conflicts with the Palestinians, leaning on allies like the United States, opening lines to old enemies like Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states, and falling back on tough talk.
  ''None of Israel's major wars have been on his watch,'' said Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist at the Israeli news outlet Haaretz, who wrote a biography, ''Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.'' ''He's never been quick to mobilize and send in the whole army, which is in line with his character and experience.''
  Mr. Pfeffer said he once calculated the average annual number of Israelis killed in war under Israeli prime ministers. Until Oct. 7, when more than 1,300 Israelis were killed by Hamas, the number was lowest under Mr. Netanyahu. Several of his predecessors, from Menachem Begin to Ehud Olmert, have taken far bigger military risks.
  ''Every time they've had a conflict with Hamas, there's been talk of a ground incursion, and he didn't want to do it,'' said Daniel C. Kurtzer, who served as American ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 and now teaches at Princeton. ''He didn't want to be a prime minister who presided over X number of funerals.''
  To be sure, Mr. Netanyahu has not hesitated to target Hamas when its rockets have rained on Israeli towns and villages. In 2014, he ordered a more limited ground operation into the Gaza Strip, which enhanced his reputation domestically as a protector, even as it subjected Israel to international criticism for an operation that, for all its limited nature, still killed an estimated 2,251 Palestinians in 50 days of fighting.
  Mr. Netanyahu's reluctance to go even further, these observers said, is rooted in both his risk aversion -- a trait that has also influenced his go-slow approach to peace talks with the Palestinians -- and his military training. Like most young Israelis, Mr. Netanyahu enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces after high school. He served in a special forces unit that carried out cross-border raids.
  In a tragedy that looms large in the Netanyahu family lore, his older brother, Yonatan, was the only Israeli soldier killed in the Entebbe raid, a much-celebrated counterterrorism operation to rescue hostages on an Air France jet that had been hijacked by Palestinian militants and diverted to Libya, and later Uganda, in 1976.
  Those experiences, analysts said, imbued Mr. Netanyahu with a bias for tactical strikes over large-scale army operations. That has translated into a calculation that, with periodic bombardments of Gaza -- a strategy some have called ''mowing the grass'' -- Israel could keep a lid on Hamas's destructive capacity, as well as Palestinian tensions, without having to find a lasting political solution.
  Instead, Mr. Netanyahu put his energy into trying to normalize diplomatic relations with Israel's Arab neighbors, through the Abraham Accords and talks now underway with the Saudis. Such links, its supporters reasoned, would effectively bypass the Palestinians, making that conflict a manageable sideshow. The recent attacks showed both the limits and the unsustainable nature of this strategy.
  The barbarity of the Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians has upended the risk calculus for Mr. Netanyahu, several experts said. A ground invasion that might once have seemed like a high-risk venture now appears to many Israelis as the appropriate response to the worst attack inflicted on the Israeli people since the state's founding in 1948.
  ''In a sense, he's diffused the responsibility on to the war cabinet,'' said Mr. Kurtzer, who has known him since the 1990s. ''It's a national emergency, there's a unity government, and there's a high premium put on unity.''
  But Mr. Pfeffer noted that Mr. Netanyahu had rarely built trust with the generals of the Israel Defense Forces, viewing them as potential political rivals. That will be tested in coming days by the war cabinet, which contains three former generals, including Benny Gantz, who nearly unseated him as prime minister in 2020.
  After so many years in power, so many feuds and rivalries, and such a public outcry over his proposed overhaul of the Israeli judiciary, Mr. Netanyahu, critics say, will find it hard to remake himself as a Winston Churchill-like figure.
  ''He is a deeply polarizing figure, so he can't wear the mantle of a unifying wartime leader,'' said Daniel Levy, the president of the U.S./Middle East Project, a think tank based in London and New York. ''I would not underplay the fact that the day after the war ends, it's not going to be a happy place for him politically.''
  The prospect of a public inquiry into the intelligence failures that allowed Hamas to carry out its assault looms over Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Levy said, even if it has been set aside for the time being. For Mr. Netanyahu, waging a successful war, however difficult, could be one of the few political lifelines he has left.
  And yet he does not need to look far back in Israeli history to see the political risks of large-scale major military action. In 2006, Mr. Olmert, a newly elected prime minister, decided to order a major ground operation in Lebanon after the Islamic group Hezbollah fired rockets and conducted a raid in Israel, abducting and killing soldiers.
  After 34 days of fighting, the United Nations brokered a cease-fire, leaving Hezbollah, which had been supplied by Iran, damaged but alive. Though Mr. Olmert claimed to have made gains for Israel, his popularity crumbled, there were calls for his resignation, and he faced a withering public inquiry.
  In 1981, Mr. Begin faced intense criticism overseas for authorizing an airstrike that destroyed an unfinished nuclear reactor near Baghdad -- an operation seen as a forerunner of a potential attack on Iran.
  Other Israeli leaders, from Shimon Peres to Ariel Sharon and Ehud Barak, have struggled with the fallout from major military clashes. Mr. Netanyahu's initial rise to power in 1996 was fueled in part by public anger over a wave of suicide bombings that occurred while Mr. Peres was in office.
  Years later, when Mr. Barak served as defense minister in a coalition government under Mr. Netanyahu, he was viewed as more open than the prime minister to striking Iran to destroy its nuclear facilities.
  Mr. Netanyahu warned repeatedly of the need to stop Iran's uranium enrichment program by any means necessary. That rattled officials in the Obama administration, who feared that airstrikes would ignite a conflagration across the region. Yet he never won the full backing of the Israeli cabinet to order the strikes.
  Some American officials said at the time that Mr. Netanyahu's failure to pull the trigger, though welcome, was of a piece with his unwillingness to take risks in peacemaking. In 2014, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic quoted an unnamed senior administration official describing Mr. Netanyahu with an epithet that suggested he was chicken.
  Angry Israeli officials speculated about how high-level the anonymous critic was. But even at home, some questioned whether Mr. Netanyahu ever planned to go through with it.
  ''The question is, was it convenient for him that he didn't get enough support in the cabinet?'' said Mr. Pfeffer, the biographer. ''If Netanyahu was entirely determined to strike Iran, he would have done it.''

There were hopes for a last-minute deal, but both sides said they weren’t close to an agreement.
International hopes of reaching a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan were dashed on Sunday, hours before Palestinians and other Muslims were to begin the month of daytime fasting, as Hamas repeated demands for a comprehensive cease-fire, which Israel has rejected.
Egypt, Qatar and the United States had sought to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas before the start of Ramadan on Monday, and there had been optimism for a last-minute deal that would allow for the release of some Israeli hostages held in Gaza and Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
But weeks of indirect negotiations have stalled, and a top Hamas political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said in a televised speech on Sunday that Hamas wanted an agreement that would end the war, guarantee the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, return displaced Palestinians to their homes and provide for the humanitarian needs of Gazans.
Israel “wants to get its prisoners back and then resume the war on our people,” he said.
Mr. Haniyeh said if the mediators were to inform Hamas that Israel was committed to ending the war, withdrawing from Gaza and permitting the return of displaced people to the north, then the Islamist group would be ready to show flexibility on the issue of exchanging Palestinian prisoners for hostages.
“The enemy must understand that it will pay a price on the issue of an exchange, but the top priority is protecting our people, ending the aggression and massacres, returning the displaced people to their homes, and opening a political horizon for our issue and people,” he said.
Some Palestinians in Gaza have criticized Hamas, arguing the group was holding up negotiations in order to press Israel into freeing more Palestinian prisoners.
In an interview with Politico that was published on Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel suggested a cease-fire was not imminent, saying that he would “like to see another hostage release” but that there had not been a breakthrough in negotiations.
“Without a release, there’s not going to be a pause in the fighting,” he said.
Israel has said it must wipe out Hamas’s military and governing abilities in Gaza before agreeing to end the war. It also has said a key goal of the war was the return of all the hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7.
On Friday, David Barnea, the chief of the Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency, met with the C.I.A. director, William J. Burns, in an effort to advance a deal to release hostages, the Israeli spy agency said. Mossad accused Hamas of seeking to inflame the region at the expense of Palestinians in Gaza, but said that ongoing talks were aimed at narrowing the gaps between Israel and Hamas.
In an interview with MSNBC on Saturday, President Biden said that he remained hopeful that the United States could still help broker a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas as Ramadan approached, kicking off a month of family celebrations and nightly feasts.
“I think it’s always possible,” Mr. Biden said.

The barrage by Hezbollah was among the heaviest in the months of cross-border strikes that have fed fears that the war in Gaza could expand.
The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel on Tuesday morning, according to Israel’s military. It was one of the heaviest barrages in the months of cross-border strikes that have fed fears that the war in Gaza could expand to another front.
It was not immediately clear how many of the rockets landed or were intercepted by Israeli air defenses. Israel’s military said its fighter jets had retaliated by striking a number of sites linked to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
In a statement, Hezbollah said it had launched the volley in response to Israeli military strikes on Monday in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley and as a show of support for Palestinians in Gaza.
The group is a key ally of Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attacks on Israel led to the war in Gaza. On Tuesday, Hezbollah said that its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, had met with top Hamas officials to discuss “the ongoing negotiations to achieve a cease-fire in Gaza and fulfill the resistance’s conditions.”
One of those officials was Khalil al-Hayya, who led Hamas’s delegation at recent cease-fire talks in Cairo. The United States, Egypt and Qatar had been pushing to broker a truce between Israel and Hamas before the start of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, on Monday, but the negotiations stalled.
Since Oct. 7, Hezbollah has been firing rockets into northern Israel on a near-daily basis. The Israeli military regularly responds with strikes against Hezbollah-linked targets inside Lebanon.
Both Hezbollah and Hamas are backed by Iran, and the clashes along Israel’s border with Lebanon have raised concerns that the war in Gaza could erupt into a wider regional conflict.
The violence has displaced about 80,000 Israelis from areas near the border with Lebanon; a similar number of Lebanese have fled their homes on the other side.
Israeli leaders have said that there are only two options for restoring calm in the conflict with Hezbollah: a diplomatic agreement that moves the militant group’s forces farther from the border or, failing that, a major military offensive aimed at achieving the same goal.

Body


Muslim access to the mosque compound has long been a point of contention as Israel has exerted tighter control.
As the sermon about the Muslim holy month of Ramadan sounded over the speakers from Al Aqsa Mosque, 13-year-old Yousef al-Sideeq sat on a bench outside the compound’s gates.
“Most Fridays they prevent me from getting in, for no reason,” the young Jerusalem resident said, referring to the Israeli police.
Every Friday, Yousef visits Jerusalem’s Old City to pray at Al Aqsa, the third holiest site for Muslims and part of the compound sacred to Jewish people, who call it the Temple Mount. But since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks and Israel’s ensuing bombardment of Gaza, heavily armed Israeli police forces who guard many of the Old City’s gates have stopped him from entering the compound, he said.
He has managed to get in only twice.
Muslim access to the mosque has long been a point of contention as Israel has exerted tighter control in recent years over the compound, one of many restrictions Palestinians living under decades of Israeli occupation have had to endure.
As Ramadan begins, many also fear what, if any, additional constraints Israel may impose on the religious site, which can draw 200,000 people in one day from not just Jerusalem but the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Israel as a whole.
The Israeli police said that people were “entering after enhanced security checks that are conducted due to the current reality, alongside efforts to prevent any disturbances.” But they did not answer specific questions about whether there was a policy preventing certain worshipers, especially young men, from entering the mosque on Friday.
They said they were “maintaining a balance between the freedom of worship and the imperative of ensuring security.”
Late on Sunday, Palestinian and Israeli news media reported that police officers prevented many Palestinians from entering Al Aqsa to perform prayers for the start of Ramadan. Both media cited a video that showed officers with batons chasing and beating some Palestinians.
Israel has said there has been no change to the status quo, which allows only Muslims to worship at the compound. The site is revered by Jews as the location of two ancient temples, and by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, the compound containing Al Aqsa Mosque and other important Islamic prayer spaces. The compound includes the Dome of the Rock, a gold-domed prayer hall.
Israel captured East Jerusalem, including the Old City and the Aqsa compound, from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed it. Much of the world considers it occupied territory and does not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
Many Palestinians say their access to Al Aqsa compound has become increasingly restricted in favor of Jews, who consider the Temple Mount the most sacred place in Judaism.
Incidents at the compound have at times been the spark for broader conflicts. The second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, was set off in 2000 when Ariel Sharon, who later became Israel’s prime minister, visited Al Aqsa surrounded by hundreds of police officers. Confrontations at the compound in May 2021 contributed to the outbreak of an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas.
Hamas, the Palestinian armed group which has been in control of Gaza for years, called its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel Al Aqsa Flood, saying it was in part a response to “Judaization plans” at the mosque.
The attack killed about 1,200 people, and some 200 people were taken hostage, according to the Israeli authorities. Israel’s assault on Gaza in its war against Hamas has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan health officials.
In recent years, Jewish worshipers have prayed inside the Aqsa compound. The most extreme seek to build a third Jewish temple on the site of the Dome of the Rock.
Some of the most provocative episodes have been raids into the Aqsa compound by baton-wielding police forces firing tear gas and sponge-tipped bullets who have clashed with Palestinians throwing stones and setting off fireworks.
“Al Aqsa Flood came as a response to the settlers’ violations against Al Aqsa,” said Walid Kilani, a Hamas spokesman in Lebanon, referring to Jewish worshipers.
Israeli police officers “stormed the mosque and insulted the Muslim prayers there,” he added. “We had to retaliate, as Al Aqsa is our holy site and is mentioned in the Quran.”
In the initial weeks of the war, only Muslims ages 60 and older were allowed in, said Mohammad al-Ashhab, a spokesman for the Waqf — an Islamic trust that administers the mosque and that is financed and overseen by Jordan.
Attendance at Friday Prayer, a Muslim holy day, dropped to just 1,000 from 50,000, he said.
Though the situation has improved since then, he said, many Muslims are still prevented from attending.
Many Palestinians fear for the future of Al Aqsa, especially while Israel’s most right-wing government ever is in power. 
Last week, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it had decided against putting new restrictions on Al Aqsa during Ramadan and would allow a similar number of worshipers as in previous years.
In addition to longstanding Israeli restrictions on Muslims coming from the occupied West Bank, Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right national security minister, had called on the government to impose limits this year on Palestinian citizens of Israel.
Still, the ambiguous language of the Israeli government’s decision has some concerned. Human rights groups fear that freedom of worship could be curtailed under the guise of security and safety.
“Netanyahu’s statement does not actually guarantee full freedom of access for Muslims to Al Aqsa, but rather conditions it on security and safety needs,” Ir Amim, an Israeli rights group that focuses on Jerusalem, said in a statement following the decision. “This in turn may lead to a decision to ultimately apply collective entry restrictions during Ramadan.”
“Our freedom of worship has gone backwards,” Mr. al-Ashhab said.
To reach Al Aqsa Mosque compound, Muslim worshipers on Friday had to get through at least three layers of police barricades, where the authorities prevented people from entering, checked IDs or searched bags. Many arrived with prayer rugs in hand.
AbdulAziz Sbeitan, 30, was rushing through a Muslim cemetery on the edge of the Old City, having been turned away from Lion’s Gate, one of seven entrances to the historic district. He was on the phone with friends who were trying to enter from other gates.
The Jerusalem native has always attended Friday Prayer at Al Aqsa, but since Oct. 7 he hasn’t been able to get in once. Each Friday he tries multiple gates.
Sometimes he accompanies an older woman or young girls in an effort to get through, but each time the police have pushed him back, he said.
“It is a house of God and the house of our ancestors,” Mr. Sbeitan said as he walked quickly toward Herod’s Gate. “As Muslims, it is important; Al Aqsa is for Muslims.”
As he arrived at Herod’s Gate, he saw many young men being turned away, in some cases violently shoved by the police.
Mr. Sbeitan cursed under his breath as he lit a cigarette, watching. Around him other young men offered advice and, in some cases, discouragement.
“Come, let’s try another gate,” one said to his friend.
“Guys, we tried all the gates, they won’t let you in,” another man told them. “They let us in once, and then once we were inside the gate they pushed us back out.”
He said the Israeli police told him that young men were not allowed to enter. Like many others, the man, a 28-year-old Jerusalemite, didn’t want to give his name for fear of retribution by the police.
It wasn’t just young single men being barred. Fathers with little children and some women were turned away as well.
“It’s all according to their whims,” one woman said as she walked away after being prevented from entering through Lion’s Gate.
As the call to prayer sounded inside Al Aqsa, Yousef, the 13-year-old, joined an impromptu gathering of dozens of young men who couldn’t get in.
In past weeks those prevented from praying inside Al Aqsa would gather in the streets and conduct their own sermon and prayer. But on Friday it seemed even harder as the Israeli police shoved them away from Lion’s Gate and farther outside the walls of the Old City.
Undeterred, one man began the call to prayer, at times barely audible over the sound of sirens and horns along the street, buses trundling past and the police shouting.
Soon, another man stepped on top of a sidewalk stone barrier and began to give an off-the-cuff sermon.
“Will we not liberate Palestine?” said the man, who gave his name only as Yousef, fearing retribution despite the risk he had already taken in leading a sermon.
As he finished, more heavily armed police officers piled out of two vehicles.
The man appeared unfazed. He then led dozens — mostly teenagers and men in their 20s and 30s — in prayer on a crowded Jerusalem sidewalk surrounded by two churches and the Tomb of the Virgin. The gold Dome of the Rock, the center of the Aqsa compound, was barely visible over the Old City walls.

The comments came in concert with a U.N. report that says new building plans, violence and discrimination have pushed “the West Bank to the brink of catastrophe.”
The United Nations human rights chief on Friday condemned Israeli plans to build more than 3,000 new settler homes in the occupied West Bank, warning that settlement expansion amounts to a war crime.
The Israeli government has shrugged off criticism from the United States and others to move ahead with its building plans, which come as tensions have soared in the West Bank since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel prompted all-out war in Gaza.
“The West Bank is already in crisis,” the U.N.’s rights chief, Volker Türk, said, “yet, settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian state.”
Roughly 500,000 Israelis live in settlements in the occupied West Bank, where the Israeli military rules over roughly 2.7 million Palestinians. Much of the Israeli right believes Israel should control the West Bank in perpetuity, while Palestinians see the area as integral to their aspirations for an independent state.
Mr. Türk’s comments accompanied a report released by his office that said the expansion of settlements and a dramatic rise in associated violence and discrimination against Palestinians, particularly since Oct. 7, “have taken the West Bank to the brink of catastrophe.”
Settler violence had already reached record levels in 2023, with 835 incidents recorded before the Oct. 7 attack. Since then, settler violence has skyrocketed, the U.N. said, with another 603 settler attacks reported.
The U.N. reported nine Palestinians killed by settlers using firearms and 396 killed by Israeli security forces, with two other Palestinian deaths that could not be attributed. 
More than 1,200 Palestinian herders had been forced from their homes as a direct result of settler violence and close to 600 Palestinians, the U.N. reported.
Israel’s latest plan to build 3,476 new settler homes follows construction of 23,000 new homes in the 12 months that ended in October, the U.N. human rights office reported, representing the fastest rate of expansion since monitoring started in 2017.
The expansion represents a transfer of Israel’s population to occupied territory, which is prohibited under international law and amounts to a war crime, the U.N. said.
The policies of Israel’s current government appear aligned to an unprecedented extent with the goals of its settler movement to expand long-term control over the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and to steadily integrate this occupied territory into Israel, the U.N. said.
It cited the appointment of Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister and a settler, as an “additional minister” in the defense ministry with widespread powers over the West Bank, including over the designation of land, planning and property demolitions. Israel had recorded 468,000 Jewish Israelis in the West Bank at the end of 2022, the report noted and, in May 2023, Mr. Smotrich presented a two-year plan to attract another half-million Israelis to move there.

Israeli Limits on Al Aqsa During Ramadan Could 'Ignite' Muslim World

Reducing access to Al Aqsa, the sacred mosque compound in Jerusalem that has long been a flashpoint for tensions, may set off unrest, some Israelis warned.
The Israeli government was locked in debate on Monday on whether to increase restrictions on Muslims' access to an important mosque compound in Jerusalem during the holy month of Ramadan, leading to predictions of unrest if the limits are enforced. 
  The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that a decision had already been reached, without disclosing what it was. But two officials briefed on the deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss a sensitive matter, said a final decision would be made only after the government received recommendations from the security services in the coming days.
  On Sunday, Israeli cabinet ministers debated whether to bar some members of Israel's Arab minority from attending prayers at the Aqsa Mosque compound, a site which is sacred to Muslims and Jews alike, during Ramadan, according to the two officials.
  Israel has long limited access to Al Aqsa for Palestinians from the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and since the start of the war in Gaza, it has imposed extra restrictions on Arab citizens and residents of Israel. Some had hoped those limits would be largely lifted for Ramadan, which is expected to begin around March 10 -- but the talk now is of increasing them, instead.
  Dan Harel, a former deputy chief of staff in the Israeli military, said in a radio interview that such a move would be ''unnecessary, foolish and senseless'' and might ''ignite the entire Muslim world.'' One Arab Israeli lawmaker, Waleed Alhwashla, said on social media that it would be ''liable to pour unnecessary oil on the fire of violence.''
  In Muslim tradition, it is from the site of Al Aqsa compound that the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven, and tens of thousands of Muslims visit the mosque every day during Ramadan. For Jews, it is revered as the Temple Mount because it was the site of two Jewish temples in antiquity that remain central to Jewish identity.
  It has also been a flashpoint for unrest.
  Israeli police raids at the site, riots there by young Palestinians and visits by far-right Jewish activists have often been a catalyst for wider violence, including a brief war between Israel and Hamas in 2021.
  The debate over new restrictions at the mosque compound on worshipers below a certain age came as the repercussions of the war in Gaza continued to be felt throughout the region on Monday.
  On the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, the crew of a cargo ship was forced to abandon ship after it came under attack from Houthi militia members, who have been firing missiles at ships there and in the Gulf of Aden in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The attack on the British-owned ship, the Rubymar, appeared to be one of the Houthis' most damaging so far.
  Most of the group's missile and drone assaults on ships have failed to inflict serious damage, but the strike on Monday night, involving two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Yemen, according to the U.S. military, was enough to drive the crew off the vessel. A warship that is part of a U.S.-led coalition responded to a distress call, and the crew was taken to a nearby port by another merchant vessel, Central Command said in a statement.
  In retaliatory strikes, the U.S.-led coalition has repeatedly hit missiles and launchers in Yemen and intercepted drones and missiles, but so far it has failed to halt the attacks. The United States struck five Houthi targets, including an underwater drone, over the weekend. And on Monday, the European Union announced that it would be launching its own operation to accompany vessels and protect them from attack.
  In the southern Gaza Strip, where Israeli troops were poised to extend their invasion, patients were being evacuated from a hospital that Israel claims has been used to conceal Hamas military operations. Hamas has denied those accusations.
  On Monday, the hospital, the Nasser Medical Center, was little more than a shelter for a small, terrified crew of staff members and remaining patients. Dozens were evacuated from the hospital on Sunday and Monday, and the United Nations said negotiations were continuing for the Israeli military to allow more to leave.
  The exodus was prompted by a raid last week by Israeli troops who entered the hospital and detained what Israel said was hundreds of people. Thousands of displaced Palestinians evacuated before and during the raid, leaving 15 health care workers and more than 150 patients hanging on inside with little food, few medical supplies and no tap water or electricity, the World Health Organization said Monday.
  The war began on Oct. 7 after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing, the Israelis say, around 1,200 people. In the Israel land and air assault on Hamas forces in Gaza that followed, more than 29,000 residents of the enclave have been killed, Gazan health officials say.
  The move to impose more restrictions on the mosque in Jerusalem was promoted in the Israeli cabinet by Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister for national security, who has long pushed for greater Jewish control over the site and less Muslim access to it. In recent days, he has warned that Muslim worshipers might use the mosque to display support for Hamas.
  Analysts say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is wary of angering Mr. Ben-Gvir because his ruling coalition depends on his support. But Arab leaders as well as some Jewish Israelis have warned that by allowing Mr. Ben-Gvir to dictate policy at the mosque, Mr. Netanyahu could inflame an already volatile situation.
  Ramadan has been a critical moment for tensions between Israelis and Palestinians over the years, and on Sunday a member of Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gantz, set the holy month as a deadline for the release of Israel hostages in Gaza, warning that fighting would proceed into Rafah, along the border with Egypt, if the captives were not freed.
  The looming battles in Rafah have heightened fears of further humanitarian catastrophe among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees packed tightly in the area.

AIPAC, long influential with both parties in Washington, is drawing criticism from Democrats for trying to defeat incumbents while it struggles to move aid for Israel through Congress.
AIPAC, the pro-Israel group that has long been among Washington’s most powerful lobbying forces, is facing intense challenges as it seeks to maintain bipartisan support for Israel amid the war in Gaza — even as it alienates some Democrats with its increasingly aggressive political tactics.
While AIPAC has traditionally been able to count on strong backing from members of both parties, it has taken on a more overtly political role in recent years by helping fund electoral challenges to left-leaning Democrats it considers insufficiently supportive. The tension has been exacerbated by divisions in the Democratic Party over Israel against the backdrop of a rising civilian death toll in Gaza and the barriers placed on humanitarian aid by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
AIPAC has also had to confront the tangled politics of foreign aid on Capitol Hill, where money for Israel is caught up in the dispute over providing assistance to Ukraine. Under the sway of former President Donald J. Trump, many of AIPAC’s traditional allies on the right have opposed additional funds for Ukraine, blocking the House from moving ahead with legislation that would also provide billions to Israel. It is a standoff that the group has so far been unable to help resolve.
“I think they’re in a bit of an identity crisis,” Martin S. Indyk, who was the U.S. ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton and was a special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks under President Barack Obama, said of AIPAC. “It gets disguised by their formidable ability to raise money, but their life has become very complicated.”
AIPAC’s aggressiveness and the challenges it faces were evident this week when the group — formally the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — brought together roughly 1,600 donors and senior lawmakers from both parties, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, to rally support and show its muscle. Mr. Netanyahu spoke to the group by video link on Tuesday.
A separate video montage that played for donors at the conference featured Democratic members of Congress criticizing Israel or expressing support for the Palestinians. Officials at AIPAC, which is led by Howard Kohr, its chief executive, pressed donors to finance the group’s efforts to defeat some of the members. A panel included two challengers running against Democratic incumbents targeted by AIPAC.
But speakers and donors also pushed back against suggestions that the group was turning against the left flank of the Democratic Party. They emphasized AIPAC’s support for pro-Israel Democrats and Republicans across their respective parties’ ideologies. AIPAC donors, they noted, traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to visit members of Congress from both parties, including Democrats who identify as progressive, to seek support for the aid package.
“Most people are not purely liberal or purely conservative,” said Mark E. Ginsburg, a surgeon from New York who attended the conference. “AIPAC is an important component of the pro-Israel lobby, and it’s evolving with the times.”
Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat who attended a reception for the conference participants on Monday night, said “it’s critical that they bring, and hold, Republicans and Democrats together.”
AIPAC has criticized at least one Republican lawmaker recently, but its campaign spending in this year’s election has focused largely on opposing candidates in Democratic primary elections it judges not to be in sync with its agenda. AIPAC’s super PAC, United Democracy Project, has already spent money seeking to defeat candidates in Democratic primaries for House seats in California and Illinois deemed insufficiently supportive of Israel, including a Chicago community organizer who has described Israel’s offensive in Gaza as “genocide.”
And AIPAC has blasted its closest — though far smaller — rival, the more dovish pro-Israel group J Street, which has criticized Mr. Netanyahu and called for a negotiated stop to the war.
J Street “is many things,” AIPAC has said repeatedly on social media, “but it is not pro-Israel.”
Jeremy Ben-Ami, J Street’s president, responded, “Intra-communal bickering and organizational food fighting does nothing to advance the security and well being of the people of Israel.”
AIPAC’s bare-knuckled approach has sparked protest. On Monday, a coalition of progressive interest groups launched an initiative called “Reject AIPAC,” an effort to counter the $100 million that AIPAC is expected to spend to defeat congressional candidates who have decried the civilian suffering in Gaza produced by Israel’s war against Hamas.
Marshall Wittmann, a spokesman for AIPAC, said in a statement: “Our sole criteria for evaluating candidates from both parties is their position on strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship. We believe it is entirely consistent with progressive values to stand with the Jewish state.” Regarding the anti-AIPAC initiative, he added, “We will not be deterred in our efforts by an extremist anti-Israel fringe.”
Last week Dave Min, a California Democrat targeted by AIPAC, prevailed in his primary despite a $4.7 million push against him by United Democracy Project.
AIPAC donors have told some candidates that if they accept J Street’s endorsement, they will not get AIPAC’s support, two people with knowledge of such warnings said.
AIPAC’s tactics have had a chilling effect in Congress, according to some Democrats.
“I’ve seen people who have said I really can’t vote this way because I don’t want an AIPAC opponent,” said Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin and an outspoken critic of the group. “That gets said a lot.”
AIPAC remains one of the most powerful interest groups in Washington. It raised a record amount of money in 2023, and its super PAC began this year with more than $40 million on hand to spend in campaigns. Some of its biggest donors are Republicans like the hedge-fund manager Paul Singer and the WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum.
AIPAC’s political action committee and super PAC “have given the pro-Israel community a stronger voice in the political process by directly helping to elect pro-Israel candidates and defeating detractors,” said Mr. Wittmann.
Founded in the 1950s, AIPAC for years mostly shied away from taking on incumbents by financing challenges from candidates who might be more supportive of its agenda.
But the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran, negotiated in 2015 over AIPAC’s vehement opposition, led the group to begin taking a different approach, as did the growing prominence of a new generation of Democratic progressives who were not as reflexively loyal to Israel.
Friends of the organization urged it to adopt a more aggressive stance, said one activist who was involved in those discussions, including by launching primary challenges to incumbents whose commitment to Israel seemed inadequate.
United Democracy Project and the AIPAC political action committee were launched late in 2021. In the 2022 midterms, AIPAC’s super PAC supported candidates in nearly ten Democratic primaries, with most of them winning, including in a race between two incumbents.
Then came the Oct. 7 terror attack by Hamas on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Israel’s conduct in the conflict has split Democrats and left Israel increasingly isolated internationally, underscoring the importance for AIPAC of maintaining support from the United States.
“The world is kind of deserting Israel right now,” said Representative Tim Burchett, Republican of Tennessee, after meeting with AIPAC members from his district at the reception on Monday. “So they’re worried about that.”
AIPAC’s influence relies heavily on its ability to marshal top donors like those it convened just outside of Washington for this week’s summit — most of whom had committed to donating a total of $10,000 or more to AIPAC’s political operation or to candidates endorsed by the group, according to attendees.
Officials urged the donors to give more, casting the moment as perilous for the group’s mission, even as the programming demonstrated AIPAC’s enduring clout.
On Sunday evening, Michael Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, spoke at the conference. On Monday, attendees heard from President Biden’s Middle East coordinator, Brett McGurk, as well as Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, and Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet. Mr. Gantz warned the crowd that an Israeli invasion of Rafah — the area of southern Gaza where Hamas leaders are believed to be hiding — was a question of when, not if, one listener said.
Mr. Schumer received a standing ovation when he declared that “as long as Hamas exists, there will never be a two-state solution,” according to two people who heard his remarks, “with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side in peace, prosperity, security and dignity.”

The United States on Wednesday defended Israel’s decades-long occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, arguing at the U.N.’s highest court that Israel faced “very real security needs.”
The defense came a day after the United States issued its third veto against a call for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza at the United Nations Security Council, a vote that drew an angry response from nations and aid groups that have urged a stop to the fighting to help Gaza’s civilians.
The latest show of American support for Israel was at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where Richard C. Visek, the acting legal adviser at the U.S. State Department, urged a 15-judge panel not to call for Israel’s immediate withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory.
He said that only the establishment of an independent Palestinian state “living safely and securely alongside” Israel could bring about lasting peace, repeating a longstanding U.S. position, but the prospect of which appears even more elusive amid the war in Gaza.
“This conflict cannot be resolved through violence or unilateral actions,” Mr. Visek said. “Negotiations are the path to a lasting peace.”
The court is hearing six days of arguments over the legality of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian-majority territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which has been the subject of years of debates and resolutions at the U.N. The hearings — involving more than 50 countries — were called long before Israel went to war against Hamas in Gaza, but have become part of a concerted global effort to stop the conflict and examine the legality of Israel’s policies toward Palestinians.
Even as the judges listened to arguments in the stately wood-paneled courtroom in the Netherlands, the dynamics of the Israeli occupation were playing out on the ground in the West Bank city of Jenin on Wednesday. In an overnight raid that the Israeli military said targeted “terrorism,” Israeli forces killed three people and detained at least 14 others.
Jenin, a more than 70-year-old refugee camp that is now a crowded neighborhood, has long been a center of armed struggle against Israel’s occupation. And Israeli military raids, though common for years, have become far more frequent since the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people.
Israeli forces have detained hundreds of Palestinians in West Bank raids in recent months. Deadly violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers has reached record levels, and Palestinian attacks on Israelis have also increased, underscoring the immediacy of the proceedings in The Hague.
And late Wednesday, Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet, warned that Israel was preparing to operate in the Gazan city of Rafah, near the southern border, once civilians were evacuated there. He added that if a deal was not reached to release the hostages still held in Gaza, the Israeli military would continue to operate during the holy month of Ramadan, which begins in March.
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Rafah after being displaced from their homes by the fighting in Gaza. The international community has decried Israel’s plan to invade the city because of the huge numbers of people taking refuge there.
“History will judge us for how we respond today,” Jasmine Moussa, the legal adviser to Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the court Wednesday, as she made the case for “the Palestinian people’s inalienable, permanent and unqualified right to self-determination.”
“One only needs to look at Israel’s vicious wholesale destruction of Gaza today after years of imposing the medieval methods, a siege and blockade, to realize the extent of Israel’s transgression of this principle,” she said.
The hearings are the first time the court has been asked to give an advisory opinion on the Israeli occupation. The U.N. General Assembly asked the court to review the legality of Israeli policies in the Palestinian territories more than a year ago, before Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed more than 29,000 people, according to Gazan health authorities.
Israel has said it would not participate in the hearings, and sent a letter to the court last year arguing that they were unwarranted and failed to “recognize Israel’s right and duty to protect its citizens” or its right to security.
The United States has strongly defended Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which began after the Oct. 7 attacks. But although U.S. officials have also urged Israel to scale back its military campaign and do more to protect civilians, the American defense of Israel has left it increasingly at odds even with staunch allies like France, Canada and Japan.
On Tuesday, its isolation was on display at the U.N. Security Council: It delivered the lone veto of a resolution that called for an immediate cease-fire, saying it would disrupt efforts to free hostages held in Gaza. Thirteen other nations supported the resolution, and Britain abstained.
On Wednesday, Mr. Visek, the State Department legal adviser, asked the U.N. court to uphold the “established framework” for peace that he said U.N. bodies had agreed to — one that is contingent on a “broader end to belligerence” against Israel — rather than to heed calls by other nations for Israel’s “unilateral and unconditional withdrawal” from occupied territories.
The Oct. 7 Hamas-led attacks on Israel were a reminder of the threats facing the country and of its security needs, Mr. Visek said, “and they persist.”
“Regrettably, those needs have been ignored by many of the participants in asserting how the court should consider the questions before it,” he said, referring to other countries’ testimony in the hearings.
Mr. Visek’s appearance directly preceded that of Vladimir Tarabrin, Russia’s ambassador to the Netherlands.
When he took the microphone, Mr. Tarabrin said Russia values its “stable relations” with Israel and expressed condolences over Oct. 7. But in what appeared to be a thinly veiled swipe at the United States, he said Russia “cannot accept the logic” of those who “try to defend the indiscriminate violence against civilians” in Gaza by citing Israel’s right to defend itself.
“Violence can only lead to more violence,” he said. Mr. Tarabrin criticized Israel for many of the same things Russia has been accused of perpetrating in its war in Ukraine, including annexation, deportation, transfers of populations and other violations of the Geneva Conventions.
Both Russia and the United States have used the hearings to promote their own agendas, and they have each accused the other of hypocrisy.
The countries have repeatedly been accused of employing a double standard at the U.N., with the United States not pushing for a cease-fire in Gaza while demanding one in Ukraine, as Russia criticizes Israel for some of the very things Moscow has done in Ukraine.
The court, which often hears staid disputes among nations, has lately become a venue for countries to oppose Israel. Last month, South Africa argued at the court that Israel was committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly rejected. The judges have not ruled on that claim, but issued an interim order for Israel to take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza.
On Tuesday, South Africa condemned Israel’s policies against Palestinians, calling them “a more extreme form of apartheid,” the race-based system of laws that deprived Black South Africans for decades.
Israel has long denied accusations that it operates an apartheid system, calling such allegations a slur and pointing to what it says is a history of being singled out for condemnation by U.N. bodies and tribunals.
The United States has remained Israel’s staunchest defender internationally. But the Biden administration, under increasing pressure from parts of the Democratic Party, has also shown signs of impatience with Israel’s conduct of the war, the rising toll in Gaza and the plight of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.
President Biden this month said that Israel’s military response in Gaza had been “over the top” and that the immense civilian suffering had “to stop.” The remarks came days after Mr. Biden imposed broad financial sanctions against four Israeli men over violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank.
After the hearings, which are scheduled to conclude on Monday, the court will issue a nonbinding, advisory opinion. That decision is expected to take several months.

Byline: Thomas L. Friedman Thomas L. Friedman is the foreign affairs Opinion columnist. He joined the paper in 1981 and has won three Pulitzer Prizes. He is the author of seven books, including &amp;#8220;From Beirut to Jerusalem,&amp;#8221; which won the National Book Award.
Highlight: Israel’s very legitimacy is being undermined by the enormous casualties in Gaza and its government’s failure to provide a credible postwar plan.
Body


I’ve spent the past few days traveling from New Delhi to Dubai and Amman, and I have an urgent message to deliver to President Biden and the Israeli people: I am seeing the increasingly rapid erosion of Israel’s standing among friendly nations — a level of acceptance and legitimacy that was painstakingly built up over decades. And if Biden is not careful, America’s global standing will plummet right along with Israel’s.
I don’t think Israelis or the Biden administration fully appreciate the rage that is bubbling up around the world, fueled by social media and TV footage, over the deaths of so many thousands of Palestinian civilians, particularly children, with U.S.-supplied weapons in Israel’s war in Gaza. Hamas has much to answer for in triggering this human tragedy, but Israel and the U.S. are seen as driving events now and getting most of the blame.
That such anger is boiling over in the Arab world is obvious, but I heard it over and over again in conversations in India during the past week — from friends, business leaders, an official and journalists both young and old. That is even more telling because the Hindu-dominated government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the only major power in the global south that has supported Israel and consistently blamed Hamas for inviting the massive Israeli retaliation and the deaths of an estimated 30,000 people, according to Gazan health officials, the majority of them civilians.
That many civilian deaths in a relatively short war would be problematic in any context. But when so many civilians die in a retaliatory invasion that was launched by an Israeli government without any political horizon for the morning after — and then, when the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, finally offers a morning-after plan that essentially says to the world that Israel now intends to occupy both the West Bank and Gaza indefinitely — it is no surprise that Israel’s friends will edge away and the Biden team will start to look hapless.
As Shekhar Gupta, the veteran editor of the Indian newspaper ThePrint, put it to me: “There’s enormous love and admiration for Israel in India. But a war with no end will strain it. Initial shock and awe apart, Netanyahu’s war is damaging Israel’s greatest asset: the widely held belief in the invincibility of its army, the infallibility of its intelligence services and the justness of its mission.”
Each day brings new calls for Israel to be banned from international academic, artistic and athletic competitions or events. That so much of it is hypocritical in singling out Israel for censure — while ignoring the excesses of Iran, Russia, Syria and China, not to mention Hamas — is true. But this Israeli government is doing things that make it too easy. Many of Israel’s friends are now just praying for a cease-fire so that they don’t have to be asked by their citizens or voters — especially their youth — how they can be indifferent to so many mounting civilian casualties in Gaza.
In particular, many Arab leaders who privately want to see Hamas destroyed, who understand what a warped and destructive force it is, are being pressured from the streets to the elites to publicly distance themselves from an Israel that is unwilling to consider any political horizon for Palestinian independence on any border.
Or, as Netanyahu put it in the morning-after plan he issued last Friday: Israel will keep security control over Gaza, the territory will be demilitarized, the strip’s southern border with Egypt will be sealed much more tightly in coordination with Cairo, the United Nations agency that provides primary health and education services for Palestinian refugees will be disbanded and education and administration will be completely overhauled. Civil administration and day-to-day policing will be based on “local elements with administrative and management experience.” Who will pay for all of this and how local Palestinians will be enlisted to perpetuate Israel’s control is not explained.
I have real sympathy for the strategic dilemma that Israel faced on Oct. 7 — a surprise attack by Hamas that was designed to make Israel crazy by murdering parents in front of their children, children in front of their parents, sexually abusing and mutilating women and kidnapping infants and grandparents. It was pure barbarism.
It felt to me, at least, that the world was ready initially to accept that there were going to be significant civilian casualties if Israel was going to root out Hamas and recover its hostages, because Hamas had embedded itself in tunnels under homes, hospitals, mosques and schools and made no preparations of its own to protect Gazan civilians from the Israeli retaliation it knew it would trigger.
But now we have a toxic combination of thousands of civilian casualties and a Netanyahu peace plan that promises only endless occupation, no matter if the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank transforms itself into a legitimate, effective, broad-based governing body that can take control of both the West Bank and Gaza and be a partner one day for peace.
So the whole Israel-Gaza operation is starting to look to more and more people like a human meat grinder whose only goal is to reduce the population so that Israel can control it more easily.
Netanyahu refuses to even consider trying to nurture a new relationship with non-Hamas Palestinians, because to do so would risk his prime minister’s chair, which depends on backing by hard-right Jewish supremacist parties who will never cede an inch of the West Bank. Hard to believe, but Netanyahu is ready to sacrifice Israel’s hard-won international legitimacy for his personal political needs. He will not hesitate to take Biden down with him.
But the broader point is that a unique opportunity to permanently diminish Hamas, not only as an army but also as a political movement, is being squandered because Netanyahu refuses to encourage any prospect, however long term, of building toward a two-state solution.
Still so traumatized by Oct. 7, Israelis, in my view, are failing to see that at least making an effort to move slowly toward a Palestinian state led by a transformed Palestinian Authority and conditioned on demilitarization and hitting certain institutional governance goals is not a gift to Palestinians or a reward for Hamas.
It is instead the most hard-nosed, selfish thing Israelis could now do for themselves — because Israel is losing on three fronts at once today.
It is losing the global narrative that it is fighting a just war. It has no plan to ever get out of Gaza, so it will eventually sink into the sands there with a permanent occupation that will surely complicate relations with all its Arab allies and friends across the globe. And it is losing regionally to Iran and its anti-Israel proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, who are pressuring Israel’s northern, southern and eastern borders.
There is one fix that would help on all three fronts: an Israeli government prepared to begin the process of building two nation-states for two peoples, with a Palestinian Authority that is truly ready and willing to transform itself. That changes the narrative. It gives cover for Israel’s Arab allies to partner with Israel in rebuilding Gaza, and it provides the glue for the regional alliance Israel needs to confront Iran and its proxies.
In failing to see that, I believe Israel is imperiling decades of diplomacy to get the world to recognize the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination and self-defense in their historic homeland. It is also relieving Palestinians of the burden and depriving them of the opportunity of recognizing two nation-states for two people and building the necessary institutions and compromises to make that happen. And, I repeat, it is going to put the Biden administration in an increasingly untenable position.
And it is making Iran’s day.

Amid signs of progress toward a pause in the fighting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces planned to keep pushing into Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces would push into the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah regardless of the outcome of talks to pause the fighting that appear to have been making some progress in recent days.
“It has to be done,” the Israeli prime minister said. “Because total victory is our goal, and total victory is within reach.”
Mr. Netanyahu did say that if a cease-fire deal was reached, the move into Rafah, which during 20 weeks of war has served as a last refuge for hundreds of thousands of Gazan families forced from their homes, would be “delayed somewhat.”
The push toward Rafah has drawn warnings from Israel’s closest ally, the United States, because of the potential for mass civilian casualties beyond the nearly 30,000 Gazans who have already been reported killed in the war, more than half of whom are women and children.
Mr. Netanyahu, speaking on the CBS News program “Face the Nation,” said Sunday that he believed that Israel would be “weeks away” from total victory once the Rafah operation began.
Israeli officials have said that the battle for Rafah could take place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin during the second week of March. Ramadan has been a critical moment for tensions between Israelis and Palestinians over the years.
Jordan’s foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, warned in a press briefing on Sunday of “catastrophic” consequences if fighting continued in Gaza during Ramadan. Al Jazeera quoted him as saying it “will place the entire region at the risk of an explosion.”
The Israeli government has come under intense criticism from neighbors and allies alike for the breadth of death and destruction in Gaza as it has prosecuted its war against Hamas in retaliation for the militant-led Oct. 7 attacks which killed a reported 1,200 people in Israel. Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday that the Israeli military had defied predictions and warnings from the “best of friends” at the outset of the war, an apparent reference to U.S. officials.
“They said you cannot fight, you can’t enter Gaza City, you can’t go into the tunnels, it will be a terrible blood bath,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “All of that turned out to be not true.”
Mr. Netanyahu’s comments seemed to underline the yawning gulf between how the war is being perceived inside Israel, where the main concern is the release of Israeli hostages and the defeat of Hamas, and much of the rest of the world, where there is anger and despair over the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
Mr. Netanyahu said that “this war has been forced upon” Israel and that Hamas “not only targets civilians but hides behind civilians.” Israel has also said it is taking steps to allow displaced civilians in Rafah to move to safer places.
But on Sunday, President Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, again urged caution. “We’ve been clear that we do not believe that an operation, a major military operation, should proceed in Rafah unless there is a clear and executable plan to protect civilians, to get them to safety and to feed, clothe and house them — and we have not seen a plan like that,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
Mr. Netanyahu’s comments came as an Israeli delegation prepared to leave for Qatar for intensive talks with mediators aimed at closing the gaps around a new deal for a temporary cease-fire with Hamas and the release of some hostages held in Gaza. As Israeli official familiar with the discussions said the Israeli delegation could arrive in Qatar, which has been helping mediate the talks, as soon as Monday.
The negotiations will come on the heels of talks held on Friday in Paris, where Israel’s delegation agreed to a basic outline for a deal that would involve a six-week truce and the exchange of about 40 hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, according to two Israeli officials and a regional diplomat who all requested anonymity because of the delicate nature of the talks.
Hamas representatives did not attend the Paris meeting, and it was not immediately clear how acceptable the outline was to the group.
One main sticking point in negotiations has been Hamas’s insistence, at least publicly, on a complete cessation of hostilities as a condition for any hostage deal, as well as the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners, including hundreds convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis.
Taher al-Nunu, a spokesman for Hamas’s political wing, said the group was adamant that any truce must include a long-term end to Israel’s campaign in Gaza. “We cannot talk about any ‘temporary truce’ or ‘temporary calm’ which does not guarantee these points,” Mr. al-Nunu said in a television interview on Saturday night with Al Jazeera.
Israel’s war cabinet on Saturday night approved the broad terms for a potential agreement based on the discussions in Paris, one of the Israeli officials said, clearing the way for a delegation to head to Qatar. The goal, the two Israeli officials said, was to reach a deal before the start of Ramadan.

On Saturday, President Biden warned that Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach to the war in Gaza was “hurting Israel more than helping Israel.” The Israeli prime minister replied the next day that Biden was “wrong.” The rift between the two leaders means that Israel risks losing its most important pillar of military and diplomatic support.
I’ve argued that Israel has no choice but to destroy Hamas as an effective fighting force. Here I imagine a conversation with an intelligent critic of that view.
Thousands of Gazan civilians, many of them children, have now been killed, bombed in their homes or out of them. Now they face a humanitarian catastrophe in the form of medicine and food shortages, even starvation.
How can you possibly justify it?
Like all wars, this one is horrible and heartbreaking. But I blame Hamas, not Israel, for the devastation.
Look, Hamas is a terrorist group whose leaders should face justice for the massacres of Oct. 7. But it isn’t Hamas’s bombs, missiles or artillery that have leveled Gaza. It’s Israel’s.
Right. And Hamas, which started the war, could put a halt to that rain of fire tomorrow. It rejected a six-week cease-fire that would have paused the fighting and allowed much more aid in exchange for the release of roughly 40 of the remaining 100 Israeli hostages. It could stop the fighting for good by simply surrendering.
Hamas may not want to stop the fighting, but there’s little we can do about that. Israel can stop its assault, and thus spare Palestinian lives. And because Biden has leverage on Israel, he should use it.
The best way to get Hamas to stop fighting is to beat it. If Israel were to end the war now, with several Hamas battalions intact, at least four things would happen.
First, it would be impossible to set up a political authority in Gaza that isn’t Hamas: If the Palestinian Authority or local Gazans tried to do so, they wouldn’t live for long. Second, Hamas would reconstitute its military force as Hezbollah did in Lebanon after the 2006 war with Israel — and Hamas has promised to repeat the attacks of Oct. 7 “a second, a third, a fourth” time. Third, the Israeli hostages would be stuck in their awful captivity indefinitely.
Fourth, there would never be a Palestinian state. No Israeli government is going to agree to a Palestinian state in the West Bank if it risks resembling Gaza.
All that is speculative. The reality is that children are hungry, the sick aren’t getting medicine, innocent Palestinians are being killed, now. It’s wrong to avert theoretical harms by causing actual ones.
It might be more speculative if this weren’t the fifth major war that Hamas has provoked since it seized power in Gaza in 2007. After each war, Hamas’s capabilities have grown stronger and its ambitions bolder. At some point this had to end; for Israelis, Oct. 7 was that point.
Maybe, but why can’t Israel be much more judicious in its use of force?
Do you have any specific suggestions for how Israel can defeat Hamas while being more sparing of civilians?
I’m not a military expert.
I’ve noticed that whenever Israel’s critics lecture the country on better calibrating its use of force, they don’t have any concrete suggestions. Are Israelis smart enough to fight better, but too stupid to appreciate the diplomatic consequences of not doing so?
Maybe they’re thirsty for vengeance.
The reality of urban warfare is that it’s exceptionally costly and difficult. The United States under Barack Obama and Donald Trump spent nine months helping Iraqi forces flatten the city of Mosul to defeat ISIS, with results that looked even worse than Gaza does today. I don’t remember calls for “Cease-Fire Now” then. Hamas has made it even more difficult for Israel because, instead of sheltering civilians in its immense network of tunnels, it shelters itself.
Even so, that doesn’t relieve Israel of the obligation to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.
It’s not as if Israel is not lifting a finger. On Sunday alone, 225 truckloads of aid entered Gaza through Israel, according to the Israeli military. But you seem to think that the government of Israel’s primary responsibility is to the welfare of the people of Gaza. It isn’t. As with any government, its obligations are to its own people.
Israelis are mostly doing fine now. It’s Palestinians who are dying.
Israel has spent the last five months degrading Hamas’s military capabilities to the point that it seems to have run out of rockets to fire at Israel. And around 200,000 Israelis are living as refugees inside their own country because its borders aren’t secure. No country can tolerate that. Israel didn’t come into existence to showcase the victimization of Jews. It came into existence to end their victimization.
Well, since you’re alluding to the Holocaust, it surely can’t be in Israel’s interests to be seen perpetrating a version of it in Gaza. Just look at the worldwide explosion of antisemitism since Oct. 7.
That analogy is false and offensive on many levels. Israel is fighting a war it didn’t seek, against an enemy sworn to its destruction and holding scores of its citizens hostage. If Israel had wanted to wipe out Gazans as Germans sought to wipe out Jews, it could have done so on the first day of the war. Israel is fighting a tough war against an evil enemy that puts its own civilians in harm’s way. Maybe there should be more public pressure on Hamas to surrender than on Israel to save Hamas from the consequences of its actions.
As for antisemitism, the war hasn’t generated a torrent of antisemitism so much as it has exposed it.
Probably a mix of the two. Still, you make the mistake of imagining that Hamas can be defeated. You can’t kill an idea, particularly by generating the terrible resentments that are surely brewing in Gaza and throughout the Arab world.
By that logic, the Allies should have spared Germany because National Socialism was also an idea. You may not be able to kill an idea but you can defang it, just as you can persuade future generations that some ideas have terrible consequences for those who espouse them.
So what do you suggest the Biden administration do?
Help Israel win the war decisively so that Israelis and Palestinians can someday win the peace.

After the Hamas invasion on Oct. 7, Doron Shabty and his wife and their two small children hid in Sderot, near the border with Gaza, and survived. A reservist in the infantry, he went into the army the next day.
He just returned after more than 100 days in Gaza, having lost friends. Mr. Shabty, 31, who sees himself on the political left, said he felt no sense of revenge, even if other soldiers did. Nor did he justify every act of the Israeli military, expressing sorrow over the many thousands of Gazans killed in the fight against Hamas. 
  But he said he felt certain that to restore Israelis' faith in their country's ability to protect them, there cannot be a return to the situation of Oct. 6. ''We can't live with an armed Gaza -- we just can't do that,'' he said. ''And in order to disarm Gaza, you need to pay a terrible price.''
  The shock of Oct. 7 was emotional, physical and psychological, undermining the idea of security, both personal and national, and reminding Israelis that they have powerful enemies next door who wish them dead and gone.
  Four months into the war, with mounting deaths, hostages still held by Hamas and no clear victory in sight, their own pain has numbed many Israelis to the suffering of Gazans, let alone the pain of the Palestinian citizens of Israel itself.
  Gaza's Ministry of Health says that more than 28,000 Gazans have been killed in the war, largely civilians, though the figures do not distinguish between them and combatants. The toll vastly outnumbers Israeli deaths since Oct. 7, when some 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials. The latest cumulative Israeli figures say that a total of 779 civilians, including 76 foreign citizens, and 633 soldiers and police officers have died in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. More than 100 people are held as prisoners by Hamas.
  While Israel's Western allies generally regard the start of the war as justified, given the Hamas invasion, Israel's conduct in the war has been widely criticized, given the civilian toll. South Africa has brought charges of genocide, dismissed by Israel, while even President Biden has called the Israeli military operation ''over the top.''
  But accompanied by a powerful new sense of Israel's vulnerability, Israeli attitudes toward the war, which Israeli Jews overwhelmingly support, inform virtually their every expectation for the future. It is likely to do so for a long time to come, experts and Israelis themselves say.
  Diplomats again talk of a two-state solution, but Israelis and Palestinians, both traumatized, have little faith in it and little faith in each other.
  ''Every Israeli sees themselves as a hostage family,'' said Yossi Klein Halevi, a senior fellow at the Shalom Hartman Institute. ''We are all hostages,'' read the slogans on the billboards and in the supermarkets, he pointed out. ''And emotionally that's true,'' he said.
  ''We saw ourselves as a safe haven for Jewish people, rescuing Israelis and Jews in danger, and that was the best part of ourselves,'' Mr. Halevi added. ''So the ongoing horror of the hostage situation and our helplessness is tormenting us.''
  Palestinians in Israel are traumatized, too. ''Imagine being in deep mourning and grieving your people and not being able to express that grief. It's maddening,'' said Sally Abed, 32. ''It's almost an impossible reality.''
  Jews seem to forget that Palestinians in Israel have relatives in Gaza, she said.
  ''Yet we cannot say that while existing in this traumatized Israeli society, where the vast majority are simply in this state of hate and revenge, almost like an ecstasy of destruction,'' she said.
  Ms. Abed, an Israeli-born citizen and Palestinian who lives and works in Haifa, is a leader of Standing Together, which promotes peace and an inclusive society. But even she feels she must be careful what she says. ''You're constantly being tested,'' she said.
  The other day, a Jewish colleague of her husband's made a comment about how Israel had been ''so graceful'' in making sure Gazans had food and water, she said.
  ''It was so provoking. Are you kidding me?'' she said. ''Provoking us to see if we would react, and of course we wouldn't react or risk it.''
  When the war began, her mother told her to take all of their savings and said: ''Just please leave. I don't want you here.''
  Ms. Abed paused. ''That broke my heart,'' she said. ''I know my mother doesn't want me to go.'' She and her husband discussed it. ''It is more clear to us now than ever,'' she said. ''This is my home; this is my country. We'll never leave.''
  Gadi Baltiansky, a former Israeli diplomat, runs the Geneva Initiative, devoted to the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a two-state solution. He hopes that the current war will revive that idea, but he also recognizes that, for most Israelis, Oct. 7 undermined confidence in their own state and in a secure future.
  He compares the sense of vulnerability with the years before the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, when Israel defeated a coalition of Arab armies.
  ''People see they still want to destroy us,'' he said. ''There is more antisemitism, a feeling of no safe place for a Jew. And the main mission for Israel is to protect Jews, and now it's the most dangerous place for a Jew to be.''
  The gnawing vulnerability seemed an echo of an earlier time, agreed Bernard Avishai, an American-Israeli professor and analyst. 
  ''There is a growing recognition that Israel is on the edge of a volcano, as it was between 1948 and 1967,'' he said, again surrounded by enemies. ''So everything feels genuinely existential.'' 
  Israelis have a reasonably good idea of what is happening in Gaza, he said, including the bombings and deaths of thousands of civilians as the military seeks to dismantle Hamas.
  But the Israeli news media, while regularly showing devastation in Gaza, also concentrates on Israel's own dead, and less so on Gaza's civilian toll. The death of each Israeli soldier is saturated with media attention, including images of funerals and grieving family members. Similarly, pictures of the hostages taken by Hamas are ubiquitous at supermarkets and bus stands.
  ''There is a morbid feeling of death everywhere,'' Mr. Avishai said, and the sheer numbers of casualties in Gaza produce ''a corresponding numbness.'' One day, three Israeli soldiers are killed, the next day, 21, he said. ''So should I feel worse than yesterday? But yesterday I felt awful. And if it's 50 Palestinians instead of 20? There comes a point that what the imagination can't take in will later become a movie about one person that will make us all cry.''
  Nahum Barnea, a columnist for Yedioth Ahronoth, a popular Israeli daily, said he understood Israelis who say, ''How can we trust any Palestinian?'' Israelis point to polls that show enormous support for Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza, he said. 
  But the polls are telling on both sides. The latest Peace Index survey from Tel Aviv University ''is a study in hopelessness,'' said Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israeli pollster and analyst.
  She noted that, in the survey, 94 percent of Israeli Jews and 82 percent of the total population think the Israeli military has used ''adequate or too little force'' in Gaza. Some 88 percent of all Jewish Israelis think the number of Palestinians killed or wounded in Gaza is justified by the war.
  Despite President Biden's support, only 27 percent of Jewish Israelis support a two-state solution, and 38 percent support annexation of the West Bank and Gaza with limited rights for Palestinians. (Similarly, only 24 percent of Palestinians support a two-state solution.)
  ''The Israeli and Palestinian peoples are strained to the breaking point or they're already broken,'' Ms. Scheindlin said. ''Each is inconceivably traumatized, and the suffering is ongoing every day.''
  Ofer, a soldier just back from reserve duty in the north who asked that his surname not be published to protect his family, said there was always the belief that, if necessary, Israel could destroy Hezbollah and Hamas, as well as Iran.
  ''But now, with carte blanche in a war in Gaza, it's clear we cannot,'' he said, ''and the same with Hezbollah, and that's a big change. I feel we're checkmated, restrained in Gaza by Lebanon and restrained in Lebanon by Iran and Syria. The country is more vulnerable, definitely.''
  Naomi Sternberg, 27, is the child of an Italian mother and an Argentine father who immigrated to Israel and met learning Hebrew. Born after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, she has grown up, she said, ''with a feeling of endless war and no peace on the horizon.''
  Ever since her three years in the army -- ''three years wasted,'' she said -- she works with Israeli and Palestinian women to bridge the deep differences between them. ''When Israeli women speak about conflict, they speak of security, but when Palestinian women speak, it's about justice,'' she said.
  Now, after Oct. 7, she wonders, ''Are we, as Jews, sentenced to a life that is insecure?'' She is angry, she said, because ''this could have been prevented, with a peace.''
  She wonders how much room there will be now to speak for a peace based on partnership, as opposed to separation. ''Even the left is talking now about separation,'' she said. ''But this paradigm leads us to where we are with Gazans -- we completely dehumanize each other.''
  Ms. Abed, like Ms. Sternberg, believes that two states for two peoples is essential, but unsustainable without ''real healing and reconciliation.''
  ''My fight for liberation is for me and for every Palestinian to live freely where they chose to belong,'' she said. ''Israel is my home, this is my country, and a correct democracy would respect that, and let me experience what it is to be a Palestinian in Israel.''
  Like Ms. Abed, Ms. Sternberg has no intention of giving up the struggle for a better Israel.
  ''Violence leaves such a small space for dreamers to thrive in,'' she said sadly. ''We proudly naïve people are considered not only traitors now, but stupid, which is almost worse.''
  ''But with all my energy,'' she said, ''we need to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and now more than ever I feel motivated to do that.''

The Israeli military and Gazan officials have offered diverging accounts of one of the deadliest known disasters involving civilians in the nearly five-month war.
World leaders on Friday intensified their demands on Israel to get more aid into Gaza and provide more answers about the deaths of scores of Palestinians in a scene of chaos surrounding a humanitarian convoy its forces were securing.
Many questions remained unanswered as the Israeli military and Gazan officials offered divergent accounts of one of the deadliest known disasters involving civilians in the nearly five-month war. Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, called on the Israeli military to “fully explain” the killings in northern Gaza on Thursday and joined the calls for a cease-fire that would allow for the release of Israeli hostages and for more aid to enter the territory.
“People in Gaza are closer to death than to life,” she said on social media. “More humanitarian aid must come in. Immediately.”
France’s foreign minister, Stéphane Séjourné, called for an independent investigation and said the deadly chaos surrounding the convoy was the result of a humanitarian catastrophe that has left Gazans “fighting for food.”
“What is happening is indefensible and unjustifiable,” Mr. Séjourné told France Inter on Friday. “Israel must be able to hear it and it must stop.”
The disaster unfolded Thursday morning as thousands of hungry people gathered near a food convoy in Gaza City, with Israeli troops and tanks nearby. It was a scene increasingly common in Gaza, where Palestinians fighting starvation amid Israel’s war against Hamas are regularly massing around the relatively small number of aid trucks being allowed into the territory.
What happened next is still unclear. Gazan health officials say that Israeli troops fired on the crowd, killing more than 100 people and injuring 700 others in what they called “a massacre.” An Israeli military spokesman said that soldiers had opened fire “when the mob moved in a manner which endangered them.” The military said most of the deaths had been caused by trampling and that people had also been run over by the aid trucks.
Neither account could be independently verified, and partial drone video footage released by the Israeli military, along with social media videos of the scene analyzed by The New York Times, do not fully explain the sequence of events. Videos show people crawling and ducking for cover. A hospital in Gaza City said it had received bodies of at least a dozen people who had been shot and had treated more than 100 people with gunshot wounds.
An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, told Britain’s Channel 4 that soldiers had been providing security for the convoy, which involved private vehicles distributing food supplies from international donors. Israel has come under growing international pressure to facilitate more aid deliveries as groups including the United Nations relief agency for Palestinians — the main group distributing humanitarian supplies in Gaza — say it has become too lawless and chaotic to operate in much of the territory, especially the north.
Samantha Power, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that regardless of how they had died, it was clear that people were killed or injured while trying to get food for their families.
“That cannot happen,” she said. “Desperate civilians trying to feed their starving families should not be shot at.”
She urged Israel to open more border crossings to facilitate aid reaching northern Gaza and to ease customs restrictions that she said leave flour sitting in ports while people near starvation.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry called on world leaders to impose sanctions on Israel to force it to protect civilians and ensure their humanitarian needs, arguing that it was obligated to do so under international law as an occupying power.
“They completely denied the truth of the massacre that they committed against unarmed civilians exhausted by hunger and thirst as a result of racist policies,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday.
Refugees International, an advocacy group, demanded an immediate independent investigation into the disaster and called on the United States to pause military aid to Israel until those responsible are held accountable.
“There is nothing that can justify the killing of civilians desperate to receive lifesaving relief for their families,” the group said in a statement.

Israeli Forces Bombard Central Gaza in Apparent Move Toward Expanding Ground Offensive,"

Israeli Forces Bombard Central Gaza in Apparent Move Toward Expanding Ground Offensive

Israeli forces bombarded Palestinian refugee camps in central Gaza on Tuesday, residents said, in apparent preparation to expand their ground offensive into a third section of the besieged territory.
The opening of a potential new battle zone points to the long and destructive road still ahead as Israel vows to crush Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. For weeks, Israeli forces have been engaged in heavy urban fighting in northern Gaza and in the southern city of Khan Younis, driving Palestinians into further smaller corners of territory in search of refuge.
Despite international pressure for a ceasefire and US calls for a reduction in civilian casualties, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday warned that the fight ""isn't close to finished.""
Israel's offensive has been one of the most devastating military campaigns in recent history. More than 20,600 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead.
Meanwhile, there were new signs of the Israel-Hamas war enflaming tensions around the region. An Israeli airstrike in Syria killed an Iranian general, bringing vows of revenge from Iran. US warplanes hit Iranian-backed militias in Iraq who had carried out a drone strike that wounded American soldiers there.
Residents of central Gaza on Tuesday described a night of shelling and airstrikes shaking the Nuseirat, Maghazi and Bureij camps. The camps are built-up towns, housing Palestinians driven from their homes in what is now Israel during the 1948 war and their descendants - and now also crowded with people who fled from the north.
""The bombing was very intense,"" Radwan Abu Sheitta, a Palestinian teacher said by phone from his home in Bureij. ""It seems they are approaching,"" he said of the Israeli troops.
The Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military arm, said its fighters struck an Israeli tank east of Bureij. Its report could not be independently confirmed, but it suggested Israeli forces were moving toward the camp.
Warplanes and artillery also hammered areas east of Nuseirat camp. ""We couldn't sleep because of the bombing,"" said Ezzel-Din Mohammed Abdallah al-Masry, a Palestinian fisherman who was displaced to the area from northern Gaza with his five children and other family. ""The children are terrified. We are terrified.""
REGIONAL SPILLOVER Iranian-backed militias in Iraq carried out a drone strike on a US base in Erbil in northern Iraq on Monday, wounding three American servicemembers, one of them critically, according to US officials. In response, American warplanes before dawn Tuesday hit three locations in Iraq connected to one of the main militias, Kataib Hezbollah.
The Israeli strike Monday hit a neighborhood of the Syrian capital Damascus, killing Gen. Razi Mousavi, an adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in Syria. The strike hit as he was entering a farm reportedly used as an office of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in the district of Sayeda Zeinab on Damascus' outskirts, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Throughout the war, a constellation of Iranian-backed militia groups around the region have stepped up attacks in support of Hamas. So far, all sides have appeared to calibrate the violence to stay short of sparking an all-out conflict, but the fear is that an unexpected escalation could spiral out of control.
Hezbollah and Israel almost daily exchange volleys missiles, airstrikes and shelling across the Israeli-Lebanese border. Iran-backed militias in Iraq have launched more than 100 attacks on bases housing US troops in Iraq and Syria.
In the Red Sea, attacks by Houthi militias in Yemen against commercial ships have disrupted trade and prompted a US-led multinational naval operation to protect shipping routes.
GAZA FIGHTING Israeli troops have been engaged in nearly two months of ground combat with Hamas and other militants in northern Gaza and weeks of urban fighting in Khan Younis. The battles and bombardment have levelled large swaths of both areas, and strikes have continued across the territory.
Still, Hamas fighters have shown a tough resilience. The Israeli military announced the deaths of two more soldiers Tuesday, bringing the total killed in the ground offensive to 158. Militants late Monday launched a barrage of rockets into Israel, triggering air raid sirens in the southern city of Ashkelon. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
Israel has vowed to continue fighting to eliminate Hamas' military and governing capabilities in Gaza, after the militants carried out their shock attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. Israel says it also aims to free the more than 100 hostages who remain in captivity in Gaza.
Israel faces international criticism for the civilian death toll. It blames Hamas, citing the militants' use of crowded residential areas and tunnels. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas militants, without presenting evidence.
In Khan Younis, the Palestinian Red Crescent said Tuesday morning its medics evacuated several dead and wounded after a house in the city's al-Amal neighborhood was bombed overnight. In nighttime footage posted by the charity, first responders and residents pulled a dead person from the rubble, using lights from mobile phones.
An Associated Press cameraman on the scene saw at least two dead and 15 wounded, mostly children.
The expanding fighting has pushed the population into a shrinking area, particularly the central city of Deir al-Balah and Rafah, at the far south of Gaza on the Egyptian border. More than a million people have squeezed into UN shelters, and many more displaced people are crowded into houses.
UN officials have warned that a quarter of the population is starving under Israel's siege of the territory, which allows in only a trickle of food, water, fuel, medicine and other supplies.
The UN Security Council last week called for immediately speeding up aid deliveries to desperate civilians in Gaza. But so far there has been little concrete sign of a change in entry of aid, which the UN has said it struggles to distribute because many areas are cut off by fighting.
Meanwhile, negotiations have seemed to make little headway toward a pause in fighting to allow the exchange of more hostages held in Gaza for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
Egypt has put forward an ambitious peace proposal aiming not only to end the war but also to lay out a plan for the day after. It calls for a phased hostage release and the formation of a Palestinian government of experts to administer the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank, according to a senior Egyptian official and a European diplomat familiar with the proposal.
But it has gotten a cool public reception from Israel and Hamas. It falls short of Israel's declared goal of crushing Hamas and appears to be at odds with Israel's insistence on maintaining military control over Gaza for an extended period after the war. It is also unclear if Hamas would agree to relinquish power after controlling Gaza for the past 16 years.

Gaza Field Source: New Weapons Alter Tactics in War with Israel

Israel and Hamas have started experimenting with new weapons and altering their combat tactics based on past experiences, a field source, who requested anonymity, told Asharq Al-Awsat.
After a prolonged and complicated battle, fighters have discovered significant changes in the Israeli army's weapons and tactics, added the source, who is also a member of armed military wings in Gaza.
The source said the Israelis have started using remotely operated weapons, including AI-driven tanks.
The Quadcopter drone, initially designed for surveillance or the firing of gas bombs, has been equipped with mounted machineguns.
Gazans told Asharq Al-Awsat that Israeli forces have used new bombs and missiles not previously tested in any war.
Moreover, there is an increasing reliance on deploying drones, trained dogs, and robots to combat zones, particularly in dealing with tunnels, rather than sending soldiers, noted the source.
After an extended period of combat, Palestinian fighters became aware of Israel's use of unmanned tanks, prompting them to modify their approach in dealing with these vehicles and making a decision to refrain from targeting them except in specific situations.
These unmanned tanks maneuver with agility and fire like conventional ones. They were discovered after fighters successfully targeted them on multiple occasions.
In addition to the shift in tank-targeting tactics, the fighters completely changed their approach to a hit-and-run style.
Sources within Palestinian factions stated that fighters have transformed destroyed houses into observation points, moving without weapons until obtaining them shortly before launching attacks from specific locations, complicating the task of Israeli surveillance.
In Gaza, Palestinian fighters are using anti-armor and individual weapons and then engaging Israeli soldiers with light arms. Additionally, they are deploying drones in their attacks.
Hamas employs inexpensive and modified drones, some repurposed as ""suicide"" drones, while others to carry and drop bombs.

Palestinians Flee from Central Gaza's Main Hospital as Fighting Draws Closer and Aid Groups Withdraw,"

Palestinians Flee from Central Gaza's Main Hospital as Fighting Draws Closer and Aid Groups Withdraw

Medics, patients and displaced people are fleeing from the main hospital in central Gaza as the fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants draws closer, witnesses said Monday. Losing the facility would be another major blow to a health system shattered by three months of war.
Doctors Without Borders and other aid groups withdrew from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah in recent days, saying it is too dangerous. That spread panic among people sheltering there, causing many to join the hundreds of thousands who have fled to the south of the besieged territory.
Israel says it has largely wrapped up major operations in northern Gaza and is now focusing on the central region and the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli officials have said the fighting will continue for many more months as the army seeks to dismantle Hamas and return scores of hostages taken during the militant group's Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war.
The offensive has already killed over 22,000 Palestinians, devastated vast swaths of the Gaza Strip, displaced nearly 85% of its population of 2.3 million and left a quarter of its residents facing starvation.
It has also threatened to ignite a wider war with Lebanon's Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militant groups allied with Hamas.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is back in the region this week. The US, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support for the offensive, has called on Israel to take greater measures to spare civilians but has joined it in rejecting international calls for a cease-fire.
'SICKENING SCENES' IN GAZA'S OVERWHELMED HOSPITALS Tens of thousands of people have sought shelter in Gaza's hospitals, which are also struggling to treat dozens of people wounded each day in Israeli strikes. Only 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, according to the UN humanitarian office.
Omar al-Darawi, an employee at Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital, said the facility has been struck multiple times in recent days. He said thousands of people left after the aid groups pulled out, and that patients have been concentrated on one floor so the remaining doctors can tend to them more easily.
""We have large numbers of wounded who can't move"" he said. ""They need special care which is unavailable.""
More dead and wounded arrive each day, as Israeli forces advance in central Gaza following heavy airstrikes. The Health Ministry said early Monday that 73 bodies and 99 wounded people were brought to the hospital in just the last 24 hours.
World Health Organization staff who visited Sunday saw ""sickening scenes of people of all ages being treated on blood-streaked floors and in chaotic corridors,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the UN agency, said in a statement. ""The bloodbath in Gaza must end.""
The situation is even more dire in northern Gaza, which Israeli forces cut off from the rest of the territory in late October. Entire neighborhoods have been demolished, and hundreds of thousands of people have fled, while those who remain face severe shortages of food, water and medical supplies.
The WHO said late Sunday it has not been able to deliver supplies to northern Gaza in 12 days. ""Heavy bombardment, movement restrictions, and interrupted communications are making it nearly impossible to deliver medical supplies regularly and safely across Gaza, particularly in the north,"" it said.
More than 22,800 Palestinians have been killed, and more than 58,000 wounded, since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Health officials say about two-thirds of those killed have been women and minors.
Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in heavily populated residential areas. The military says it has killed some 8,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 176 of its own soldiers have been killed in the offensive.
SEEKING TO HEAD OFF A WIDER WAR Blinken, who met with the leaders of Jordan and Qatar on Sunday, once again spoke of the need for Israel to adjust its military operations to minimize harm to civilians and allow more aid into the territory. But his main focus appeared to be preventing the war from spreading.
""This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Blinken told reporters.
The killing of a senior Hamas leader in a strike in Beirut last week ratcheted up tensions along the Israeli-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, have been regularly trading fire since the start of the war.
A Hezbollah rocket barrage hit a sensitive air traffic base in northern Israel on Saturday in one of the biggest attacks in three months of low-intensity fighting along the border. The militant group said was an ""initial response"" to the killing of Hamas' deputy political leader Saleh Arouri.
Israel has mostly sought to limit the fighting in its north. Hezbollah's military capabilities are far superior to those of Hamas. But Israeli leaders have said their patience is wearing thin, and that if the tensions cannot be resolved through diplomacy, they are prepared to go to war.
Hezbollah began firing rockets shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza. Hamas and other militants killing about 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took some 250 people hostage, over 100 of whom were released during a cease-fire in November.
Hezbollah has said its attacks, which have driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes, aim to ease pressure on Gaza. But the group appears wary of risking an all-out war that would bring massive destruction to Lebanon.

An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon hit a home in northern Israel on Sunday, killing two civilians and renewing concerns about the risk of a second front erupting in the Israel-Hamas war.
Sunday's missile strike came a day after the Israeli army said it killed several militants who crossed into Israel from Lebanon and attempted to carry out an attack.
Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said his group won't stop until a ceasefire is in place for Gaza.
""We are continuing, and our front is inflicting losses on the enemy and putting pressure on displaced people,"" Nasrallah said in a speech, referring to the tens of thousands of Israelis who have fled northern border areas.
Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has surged in parallel with Israel's more than three-month-old Gaza war against Palestinian Hamas.
An anti-tank missile fired at Kfar Yuval, an agricultural collective abutting the Lebanese border, struck a house, killing the woman and her 40-year-old son, Israeli military and medical officials said.
A 74-year-old man was wounded, a hospital official said, describing him as a member of the same family of farmers.
The military said its forces were striking Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in retaliation.

Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes deep inside Lebanon late Wednesday evening, hitting a forested area near the town of Bouslaya, more than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the border, Lebanese state media reported.
The strikes came after a day of clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border, where the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have clashed near-daily since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war. In recent days, officials from the US and France visiting the region have sought to head off an escalation on the Lebanese front.
Earlier Wednesday, Hezbollah announced it had launched surface-to-air missiles at Israeli military helicopters, and the Israeli army said it had hit a ""military compound, launch posts, a command center, and a weapons depot"" belonging to Hezbollah.
Also on Wednesday, Lebanon's National News Agency reported that an Israeli sniper had shot and killed a man in his car near the Lebanese border town of Kfar Kila. Hezbollah, which normally announces the deaths of its fighters, did not claim the man as a member. The group later announced that one of its fighters had been killed in an Israeli strike on a house in the town of Markaba on Wednesday evening.
More than 110 Hezbollah fighters and at least 16 civilians have been killed on the Lebanese side of the border, while at least nine soldiers and five civilians have been killed on the Israeli side.

In 100 Days, the Israel-Hamas War Has Transformed the Region. The Fighting Shows No Signs of Ending

Sunday marks 100 days that Israel and Hamas have been at war.
The war already is the longest and deadliest between Israel and the Palestinians since Israel's establishment in 1948, and the fighting shows no signs of ending.
Israel declared war in response to Hamas' unprecedented cross-border attack on Oct. 7 in which the militant group killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage. It was the deadliest attack in Israel's history and the deadliest for Jews since the Holocaust.
Israel responded with weeks of intense airstrikes in Gaza before expanding the operation into a ground offensive. It says its goal is to crush Hamas and win the release of the more than 100 hostages still held by the group.
The offensive has wrought unprecedented destruction upon Gaza. But more than three months later, Hamas remains largely intact, and hostages remain in captivity. The Israeli military says the war will stretch on throughout 2024.
Here are five takeaways from the first 100 days of a conflict that has upended the region.
ISRAEL WILL NEVER BE THE SAME The Oct. 7 attack blindsided Israel and shattered the nation's faith in its leaders.
While the public has rallied behind the military's war effort, it remains deeply traumatized. The country seems to be reliving Oct. 7 - when families were killed in their homes, partygoers gunned down at a music festival and children and older people abducted on motorcycles - every day.
Posters of the hostages who remain in Hamas captivity line public streets, and people wear T-shirts calling on leaders to ""Bring Them Home.""
Israeli news channels devote their broadcasts to round-the-clock coverage of the war. They broadcast nonstop tales of tragedy and heroism from Oct. 7, stories about hostages and their families, tearful funerals of soldiers killed in action and reports from Gaza by correspondents smiling alongside the troops.
There is little discussion or sympathy over the skyrocketing death toll and deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Plans for postwar Gaza are rarely mentioned.
One thing has remained constant. While chastened Israeli security officials have apologized and signaled that they will resign after the war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remains firmly entrenched.
Despite a sharp drop in his public approval ratings, Netanyahu has resisted calls to apologize, step down or investigate his government's failings. Netanyahu, who has led the country for almost all of the past 15 years, says there will be a time for investigations after the war.
Historian Tom Segev said the war will shake the country for years, and perhaps generations, to come. He said the failures of Oct. 7 and the inability to bring the hostages home have fomented a widespread feeling of betrayal and lack of faith in the government.
""Israelis like their wars to go well. This war doesn't go so well,"" he said. ""Lots of people have the feeling that something very, very deep is wrong here.""
GAZA WILL NEVER BE THE SAME Conditions before Oct. 7 were already difficult in Gaza after a stifling blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt following Hamas' takeover in 2007. Today, the territory is unrecognizable.
Experts say the Israeli bombing is among the most intense in modern history. Gaza health authorities say the death toll already has eclipsed 23,000 people, roughly 1% of the Palestinian territory's population. Thousands more remain missing or badly wounded. Over 80% of the population has been displaced, and tens of thousands of people are now crammed into sprawling tent camps on small slivers of space in southern Gaza that also come under Israeli fire.
Jamon Van Den Hoek, an Oregon State University mapping expert, and colleague Corey Scher of the City University of New York's Graduate Center, estimate that roughly half of Gaza's buildings have likely been damaged or destroyed, based on satellite analysis.
""The scale of likely damage or destruction across Gaza is remarkable,"" Van Den Hoek wrote on LinkedIn.
The human cost is equally mind-boggling. The United Nations estimates that about one-quarter of Gaza's population is starving. Just 15 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are partially operational, according to the UN, leaving the medical system close to collapse. Children have missed months of school and have no prospects for returning to their studies.
""Gaza has simply become uninhabitable,"" wrote Martin Griffiths, the UN's humanitarian chief.
IT'S ALL CONNECTED The war has rippled across the entire Middle East, threatening to escalate into a broader conflict pitting a US-led alliance against Iranian-backed militant groups.
Almost immediately after the Hamas attack, Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon began striking Israel, triggering Israeli retaliatory attacks.
The back-and-forth fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has not erupted into a full-blown war. But it has come perilously close, most recently after a Jan. 2 airstrike blamed on Israel that killed a top Hamas official in Beirut. Hezbollah responded with heavy barrages on Israeli military bases, while Israel has assassinated several Hezbollah commanders in targeted airstrikes.
At the same time, Iranian-backed Houthi militias in Yemen have carried out a series of attacks on civilian cargo ships in the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Iranian-backed militias have attacked US forces in Iraq and Syria.
The United States has dispatched warships to the Mediterranean and Red Seas to contain the violence.
Late Thursday, the US and British militaries bombed more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen. The Houthis vowed to retaliate, raising the prospect of an even wider conflict.
ISRAEL CAN'T IGNORE THE PALESTINIANS Throughout his time in office, Netanyahu has repeatedly attempted to sideline the Palestinian issue.
He has rejected various peace initiatives, dismissed the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority as weak or irrelevant, and promoted policies that left Palestinians divided between rival governments in Gaza and the West Bank.
Instead, he has tried to normalize relations with other Arab countries in hopes of isolating the Palestinians and pressuring them to accept an arrangement that falls short of their dreams of independence.
The Hamas attack, along with a spike in violence in the West Bank, have put the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back on center stage. The war now tops the newscasts worldwide, has prompted four visits by Blinken to the region and resulted in a genocide case against Israel in the UN world court.
""The painful developments of the last 100 days have proven beyond doubt that the Palestinian issue and the Palestinian people cannot be ignored,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
THERE'S NO POSTWAR PLAN As the war drags on and the death toll mounts, there is no clear path for when the fighting will end or what will follow.
Israel says Hamas can play no part in Gaza's future. Hamas says that's an illusion.
The US and the international community want a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza, and steps toward a two-state solution. Israel objects.
Israel wants to maintain a long-term military presence in Gaza. The US does not want Israel to reoccupy the territory.
Reconstruction will take years. It is unclear who will pay for it or how the required materials will enter the territory through its limited crossings. And with so many homes destroyed, where will people stay during this lengthy process?
""Our lives 100 days ago was excellent. We had cars and houses,"" said Halima Abu Daqa, a Palestinian woman who was displaced from her home in southern Gaza and is now living in a tent camp.
""We have been deprived of everything,"" she said. ""Everything has changed and nothing remains.""

Israel Strikes South Gaza, Raids Hospital in the North, Killing Dozens

Israeli forces raided one of the last functioning hospitals in Gaza's north and bombarded the south with airstrikes that killed at least 28 Palestinians, pressing ahead with their offensive Tuesday with renewed backing from the United States, despite rising international alarm.
The air and ground war, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed nearly 20,000 Palestinians, displaced some 1.9 million, demolished much of northern Gaza and sparked attacks on US and Israeli targets across the region.
Assaults on ships in the Red Sea by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militias have led major shipping companies - as well as the oil and gas giant BP - to suspend trade through the vital waterway, prompting the US and its allies to launch a new mission to counter the threat.
But after meeting with Israeli officials Monday, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he was ""not here to dictate timelines or terms.""
His remarks signaled that the US would continue shielding Israel from growing international calls for a ceasefire as the United Nations Security Council was set to hold another vote Tuesday, and would keep providing vital military aid for one of the 21st century's deadliest military campaigns.
STRIKES IN THE SOUTH A strike on a home in Rafah where displaced people were sheltering killed at least 25 people, including a 2-year-old boy and his newborn sister, and another strike killed at least three people, according to Associated Press journalists who saw the bodies arrive at two local hospitals early Tuesday.
Rafah, which is in the southern part of Gaza where Israel has told Palestinians to seek shelter, has been repeatedly bombarded in recent days, as Israel has struck what it says are militant targets across the territory, often killing large numbers of civilians.
The military said Tuesday that it had killed a prominent Hamas financier in an airstrike on Rafah, without specifying when it occurred or if others were killed or wounded.
Meanwhile, fierce battles also raged in northern Gaza, where Hamas continues to put up stiff resistance across what is now a wasteland, seven weeks after Israeli tanks and troops stormed in following Hamas' attack on southern Israel.
Militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in that assault and abducted 240 others.
More than 19,400 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which has said that most are women and minors and that thousands more are buried under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
Israel's military says 131 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive. It says it has killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel blames civilian deaths on Hamas, saying it uses them as human shields, but the military rarely comments on individual strikes.
HOSPITAL RAID Israeli forces raided the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City overnight, according to the church that operates it, destroying a wall at its front entrance and detaining most of its staff.
The facility was the scene of an explosion early in the war that killed dozens of Palestinians, and which an Associated Press investigation later determined was likely caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket.
Don Binder, a pastor at St. George's Anglican Cathedral, which runs the hospital, said the raid left just two doctors, four nurses and two janitors to tend to over 100 seriously wounded patients, with no running water or electricity.
""It has been a great mercy for the many wounded in Gaza City that we were able to keep our Ahli Anglican Hospital open for so long,"" Binder wrote in a Facebook post late Monday. ""That ended today.""
He said an Israeli tank was parked on the rubble at the hospital's entrance, blocking anyone from entering or leaving.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. Forces have raided other hospitals across Gaza, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff have denied the allegations and accused Israel of endangering critically ill and wounded civilians.
The military said Tuesday that troops found an explosive device inside a clinic in Shijaiyah, a Gaza City neighborhood that has seen heavy fighting in recent days. It did not say whether the clinic was operational, and in footage released by the military it appeared to have been abandoned.
SECURITY COUNCIL TO VOTE ON NEW TRUCE PROPOSAL The UN Security Council delayed to Tuesday a vote on an Arab-sponsored resolution calling for a halt to hostilities to allow unhindered access to humanitarian aid. Diplomats said negotiations were taking place to get the US to abstain or vote ""yes"" on the resolution after it vetoed an earlier call for a ceasefire.
France, the United Kingdom and Germany - some of Israel's closest allies - joined global calls for a ceasefire over the weekend. In Israel, protesters have called for negotiations with Hamas to facilitate the release of scores of hostages still held by the group.
DIPLOMACY RAMPS UP CIA Director William Burns met in Warsaw with the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency and the prime minister of Qatar on Monday, the first known meeting of the three since the ceasefire and the release of some 100 hostages in a deal they helped broker.
But US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the talks were not ""at a point where another deal is imminent.""
Hamas and other militants are still holding an estimated 129 captives.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Israel will keep fighting until it ends Hamas rule in Gaza, crushes its military capabilities and frees all the hostages taken during the Oct. 7 attack. For now, at least, he seems to have full US support for a campaign that could last months or years.

Gaza War Will Go on for Months, Israel's Military Chief Says

Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza will likely go on for many months, the country's military chief said on Tuesday.
""The war will go on for many months and we will employ different methods to maintain our achievements for a long time,"" Chief of the General Staff Herzi Halevi told reporters in a televised statement on the Gaza border.
""There are no magic solutions, there are no short cuts in dismantling a terrorist organization, only determined and persistent fighting,"" said Halevi. ""We will reach Hamas' leadership too, whether it takes a week or if it takes months.""
Israel vowed to annihilate Hamas after its fighters burst into Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages. Its air, sea and ground offensive in Gaza has since killed nearly 21,000 Palestinians, according to authorities.
""We said from its first moments that this would be a long war because it was right to set far-reaching goals and we will reach far, that's why the duration will be long."" The duration, Halevi said, will allow the military to adapt its methods.
""Ultimately, will we be able to say that there is no enemy surrounding the state of Israel? I think that's too ambitious, but we will create a new security situation,"" said Halevi.

Gaza War Extends into Beirut with Killing of Hamas Leader

Israeli forces intensified their bombing of the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and told civilians to leave a refugee camp in the north of the Palestinian enclave after the war stretched into Lebanon with the killing in Beirut of the Hamas deputy leader.
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied that it killed Saleh al-Arouri in a drone strike in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday. But military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces were in a high state of readiness and prepared for any scenario.
The assassination was a further sign that the nearly three-month war between Israel and Hamas was spreading across the region, drawing in the occupied West Bank, Hezbollah forces on the Lebanon-Israel border, and even Red Sea shipping lanes.
Arouri, 57, who lived in Beirut, was the first senior Hamas political leader to be assassinated since Israel began its offensive against the militant group in response to its deadly rampage into Israeli towns on Oct. 7.
Hamas politburo member Hossam Badran said in a eulogy for Arouri: ""We say to the criminal occupation (Israel) that the battle between us is open.""
Israel had long accused him of orchestrating attacks on its citizens. But a Hamas official said he was also ""at the heart of negotiations"" conducted by Qatar and Egypt over the outcome of the Gaza war and the release of Hamas-held Israeli hostages.
Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was due to make a speech in Beirut on Wednesday afternoon. Previously he had warned Israel against carrying out assassinations on Lebanese soil, vowing a ""severe reaction"".
The heavily armed Iran-backed Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, has been exchanging near-daily fire with Israel across Lebanon's southern border since the Gaza war began. More than 100 Hezbollah fighters and two dozen civilians have been killed on Lebanese territory, as well as at least nine Israeli soldiers in Israel.
Following Arouri's killing, the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon said it was deeply concerned about the possibility of an escalation ""that could have devastating consequences for people on both sides of the border"".
Refugee camp under fire
In Gaza itself, Israeli forces bombed Al-Nusseirat refugee camp in the northern part of the Hamas-ruled enclave overnight and into Wednesday, destroying several multi-floor buildings, residents and Palestinian media said.
Israeli planes also dropped leaflets on Al-Nusseirat ordering people to leave seven districts.
""You are in a dangerous combat area. The IDF is operating heavily in your area of residence. For your safety the IDF urge you to immediately evacuate this area and leave towards the known shelters in Deir Al-Balah (west),"" the leaflets said.
Israeli war planes and tanks also stepped up attacks on the Al-Bureij refugee camp.
Hamas' armed wing said it had killed 10 Israeli soldiers in fighting in Al-Bureij and hit five tanks and troop carriers. The Israeli military said the number of its soldiers killed since its first incursion into Gaza on Oct. 20 had reached 177.
In the Al-Maghazi refugee camp, health officials said at least four people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house. They said three people were also killed in an air strike on a house in Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip.
Israel says it tries to avoid harm to civilians. But the total recorded Palestinian death toll has now reached 22,185, according to the Gaza health ministry.
The war was triggered by a cross-border Hamas assault on Israeli towns on Oct. 7 in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed and some 240 hostages taken back to Gaza.
Since then, Israeli bombardments have laid waste to much of the enclave. Its 2.3 million residents are engulfed in a humanitarian disaster in which thousands have been left destitute, crammed into shrinking areas in the hope they are safe and threatened by famine due to a lack of food supplies.
'Veins of resistance'
Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets of Ramallah and other towns in the West Bank to condemn Arouri's killing, chanting, ""Revenge, revenge"".
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said Arouri's killing would ""ignite another surge in the veins of resistance and the motivation to fight against the Zionist occupiers...""
Shortly before Arouri's killing, Hamas' paramount leader Ismail Haniyeh, who is also based outside Gaza, said the movement had delivered its response to an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal.
He reiterated that Hamas' conditions entailed ""a complete cessation"" of Israel's offensive in exchange for further releases of hostages.
Israel believes 129 hostages remain in Gaza after some were released during a brief truce in late November and others were killed during air strikes and rescue or escape attempts.
Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it has wiped out Hamas, but it is unclear what it plans to do with the enclave should it succeed, and where that leaves the prospect of an independent Palestinian state.

Israel Says Hezbollah Struck Sensitive Air Traffic Base in North, Warns of 'Another War'

Hezbollah has struck an air traffic control base in northern Israel, the Israeli military said Sunday, and warned of ""another war"" with the Iran-backed militant group.
The increase in fighting across the border with Lebanon as Israel battles Hamas militants in Gaza gave new urgency to US diplomatic efforts as Secretary of State Antony Blinken prepared to visit Israel on his latest Mideast tour.
""This is a conflict that could easily metastasize, causing even more insecurity and even more suffering,"" Blinken told reporters after talks in Qatar, a key mediator. The escalation of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has complicated a US push to prevent a regional conflict.
The Israeli military said Hezbollah fire hit the sensitive air traffic control base on Mount Meron on Saturday but air defenses were not affected because backup systems were in place. It said that no soldiers were hurt and all damage will be repaired.
Nonetheless, it was one of the most serious attacks by Hezbollah in the months of fighting that has accompanied Israel's war in Gaza and forced tens of thousands of Israelis to evacuate communities near the Lebanese border.
Hezbollah described its rocket barrage as an ""initial response"" to the targeted killing of a top Hamas leader in a Hezbollah stronghold in Beirut last week, which is presumed to have been carried out by Israel.
The Israeli military chief of staff, Lt. Col. Herzi Halevi, said military pressure on Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, was rising and it would either be effective ""or we will get to another war."" Military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari asserted that Israel's focus on Hezbollah's elite Radwan force was pushing it away from the border.
Israel has mostly sought to limit the fighting in its north. Hezbollah's military capabilities are far superior to those of Hamas. But Israeli leaders have said their patience is wearing thin, and that if the tensions cannot be resolved through diplomacy, they are prepared to use force.
""I suggest that Hezbollah learn what Hamas has already learned in recent months: No terrorist is immune,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet. ""We are determined to defend our citizens and to return the residents of the north safely to their homes.""
Lower-intensity fighting along Israel's northern border broke out when Hezbollah began firing rockets shortly after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 people hostage. Hezbollah has said its attacks aim to ease pressure on Gaza.
In a joint news briefing with Blinken, Qatar's government acknowledged that the killing of the senior Hamas leader in Lebanon could affect the complicated negotiations for the potential release of more hostages held by Hamas in Gaza but ""we are continuing our discussions with the parties and trying to achieve as soon as possible an agreement.""
Ten people died amid violence in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, including a Palestinian man killed by attackers while driving a car with Israeli plates, and a young girl shot as Israeli police fired at a car that rammed a checkpoint.
Inside Gaza, the war against the militant group entered its fourth month on Sunday.
The Israeli military has signaled that it has wrapped up major combat in northern Gaza, saying it has completed dismantling Hamas' military infrastructure there. Now it presses its offensive in the south, where most of Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians are squeezed into smaller areas in a humanitarian disaster while being pounded by Israeli airstrikes.
Netanyahu insists the war will not end until the objectives of eliminating Hamas, getting Israel's hostages returned and ensuring that Gaza won't host a threat to Israel are met.
Biden administration officials have urged Israel to wind down its blistering air and ground offensive and shift to more targeted attacks against Hamas leaders.
More than 22,800 Palestinians have been killed and more than 58,000 wounded since the war began, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. The death toll does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Health officials say about two-thirds of those killed have been women and minors.
Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in heavily populated residential areas.
An airstrike near the southern city of Rafah killed two journalists on Sunday, including Hamza Dahdouh, the oldest son of Wael Dahdouh, Al Jazeera's chief correspondent in Gaza, according to the Qatari-owned Arabic-language channel and local medical officials. Al Jazeera broadcast footage of Dahdouh weeping and holding his son's hand. Israel's military had no immediate comment.
Al Jazeera strongly condemned the killings and other ""brutal attacks against journalists and their families"" by Israeli forces. Dahdouh also lost his wife, two children and a grandchild in an Oct. 26 airstrike, and was wounded in an Israeli strike last month that killed a co-worker.
""The world is blind to what's happening in the Gaza Strip,"" he said, blinking back tears.
Another airstrike hit a house between Khan Younis and the southern city of Rafah, killing at least seven people whose bodies were taken to the nearby European Gaza Hospital, according to an Associated Press journalist at the facility. One man hurried in carrying a baby, and later walked the blanket-wrapped child to the morgue.
""Everything happening here is outside the realms of law, outside the realms of reason. Our brains can't fully comprehend all this that is happening to us,"" said a grieving relative, Inas Abu al-Najja, her quavering voice rising. Men worked the rubble with picks and bare hands.
On Sunday, officials at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis received the bodies of 18 people, including 12 children, killed in an Israeli strike late Saturday on a home in the Khan Younis camp set up decades ago to house refugees from the 1948 war over Israel's creation.
Israeli forces pushed deeper into the central city of Deir al-Balah, where residents in several neighborhoods were warned that they must evacuate.
The international medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, said it was evacuating its medical staff from Deir al-Balah's Al Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital.
A bullet penetrated a wall of the hospital's intensive care unit on Friday, and ""drone attacks and sniper fire were just a few hundred meters from the hospital"" over the past couple of days, said Carolina Lopez, the group's emergency coordinator there. She said the hospital received between 150 and 200 wounded people daily in recent weeks.
The International Rescue Committee and Medical Aid for Palestinians said they also were forced to withdraw from the hospital. ""The amount of injuries being brought in over the last few days has been horrific,"" surgeon Nick Maynard with the IRC medical team said.

Gaza War Causes Surge in 'Domestic Threats' in the US

US Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco revealed that the country is facing a ""sobering"" and ""unique moment"" in confronting domestic threats since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas on October 7.
Monaco's statement came during an interview with the ABC television network, where she provided the first specifics and detailed look at how the external conflict has stoked an already elevated threat situation that many US officials describe as the most challenging since before 9/11.
The FBI had to examine more than 1,800 reports of ""threats or other types of tips or leads"" related to the war that began with a Hamas attack against the Israeli settlements surrounding Gaza.
She added that the FBI now has more than 100 investigations currently opened in some way related to the conflict, stressing that the biggest concerns are lone wolves and small groups that take action without warning.
""I think we're in a unique moment where what we're most worried about -- those of us in the national security and law enforcement community -- are individuals or small groups who are often radicalized online and who are motivated by and influenced by a range of ideologies, from foreign terrorism and foreign terrorist organizations to domestic grievances,"" Monaco told ABC News.
""Oftentimes what we're seeing in the most lethal form is from racially or ethnically-motivated ideologies,"" the deputy attorney general said.
While Monaco noted that in many cases, the threats or tips received by the FBI have been ""resolved without incident,"" the sheer volume has caused ""a lot of strain"" on US law enforcement as agents and prosecutors chase down potential leads across the country in tandem with state and local partners.
""These are threats, they're hoaxes, they can involve claims of terrorist financing,"" Monaco said, describing the range of what authorities are reviewing.
""So that is the volume -- the significant uptick in the volume and frequency of the reports we're getting.""
Monaco cited the ""searing images"" of Hamas' attack on Israel as well as accounts of ""parents huddled with their children in safe rooms, loved ones being killed in front of each other's children -- literally ripped from their parents and being kidnapped"" and the more than 1,200 people killed, including more than 30 Americans, as evoking emotional reactions across the globe that have in turn driven a ""very significant uptick in threats"" and ""actual violence"" inside the US.
""We've seen individuals who are taking, I think, twisted inspiration from those images,"" she said.
Monaco also noted that the Justice Department has seen a surge in threats targeting political and government officials. This week alone, she pointed to cases against individuals accused of threatening a US Supreme Court justice, FBI agents, and three presidential candidates.

Israel Celebrates Al-Arouri's Assassination Without Claiming Official Responsibility

Israel celebrated the assassination of the Deputy Chief of the Political Bureau of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, but did not officially claim responsibility for the operation that killed the Hamas leader in a drone attack in Beirut, Lebanon.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also instructed Israeli ministers not to comment on the killing of al-Arouri, while attention turned to Hezbollah's stance as the assassination took place on its territory and within its security zone.
Netanyahu's foreign affairs spokesperson, Mark Regev, declared Tuesday that the slaying of al-Arouri was not an attack against Lebanon or Hezbollah.
""Obviously, in Lebanon, there are many Hezbollah targets, but whoever did this strike was very surgical and went for a Hamas target because Israel is at war... Whoever did this has a gripe with Hamas,"" Regev said during a media interview.
As the focus shifts to a previously scheduled speech by Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah on Wednesday evening, Israeli media hinted at the ""success"" of the killing operation
Yedioth Ahronoth quoted Israeli officials as stating that the ""assassination of al-Arouri is a qualitative and high-quality operation.""
According to Israel's Channel 13, al-Arouri was scheduled to meet with Nasrallah on Wednesday.
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich expressed the view that ""the fate of all enemies of Israel is destruction.""
Member of the Knesset for the Likud party, headed by Netanyahu, Danny Danon, congratulated the Israeli security forces on the assassination of al-Arouri, describing the operation as ""successful.""
Israeli media reports that the Israeli government issued orders to its ministers, prohibiting them from giving interviews regarding the assassination.
In August 2023, Netanyahu threatened to assassinate al-Arouri.
Al-Arouri was accused of orchestrating a series of attacks carried out by Hamas in the West Bank in recent weeks and months.

Israel to Face Gaza Genocide Charges at World Court

Israel prepared to defend itself on Thursday at the top UN court against accusations of genocide in the Gaza Strip.
As Israel's war against Hamas rages in Gaza, the International Court of Justice in the Hague was set to hold two days of hearings in a case brought by South Africa in December claiming the war violates the 1948 Genocide Convention.
""The State of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice to dispel South Africa's absurd blood libel, as Pretoria gives political and legal cover to the Hamas rapist regime,"" said Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy.
The hearings will deal exclusively with South Africa's request for an emergency order that Israel suspend military action in Gaza while the court, also known as the World Court, hears the merits of the case - a process that could take years.
Colombia and Brazil expressed their support of South Africa late on Wednesday.
Since Oct. 7, Israeli forces have laid waste to much of Gaza, and nearly all its 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes at least once, causing a humanitarian catastrophe. More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed.
In a statement after the case was filed late last year, the Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry urged the court to ""immediately take action to protect the Palestinian people and call on Israel, the occupying power, to halt its onslaught against the Palestinian people, in order to ensure an objective legal resolution.""
The United States rejected South Africa's genocide claims, while urging Israel to do more to protect Palestinian civilians.
""Allegations that Israel is committing genocide are unfounded,"" State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said in a statement.
""In fact, it is those who are violently attacking Israel who continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.""
Miller defended Israel's ""right to defend itself against Hamas' terrorist acts"", while adding that Israel must ""comply with international humanitarian law"" and ""look for more ways to prevent civilian harm and to investigate credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law when they arise.""

Lebanon 's Palestinian Refugees Fear for their Families in Gaza,"

Lebanon's Palestinian Refugees Fear for their Families in Gaza

In a ramshackle Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, Hayat Shehadeh wrings her hands as she watches the Israel-Hamas war. Her daughter is in Gaza, and she has not spoken to her for a week.
""I can't sleep. I get up at 3:00 am... I go to watch the television,"" said the 69-year-old from her dark flat in south Beirut's Burj al-Barajneh Palestinian camp.
""Sometimes she writes to me, 'I'm fine'. She doesn't write more than that"" because she has no way to recharge her phone battery, said the elderly woman, a baby grandchild playing with a Palestinian flag on the floor nearby.
Gaza-based Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking about 240 hostage, according to Israeli officials.
Israel has since carried out a relentless air and ground offensive in Gaza that the Hamas government says has killed some 12,000 people, including thousands of women and children.
With pain in her voice but trying to maintain her composure, Shehadeh said her daughter had separated her three children, sending them away with different relatives.
""She was crying, she said 'I split up the kids',"" her mother said, so that ""if someone dies, they don't all die.""
The Burj al-Barajneh camp is a labyrinth of alleyways, some bearing pictures of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, or stencils and posters in support of Hamas and other Palestinian groups, some glorifying the October 7 attacks.
Lebanon hosts an estimated 250,000 Palestinian refugees, many living in the country's 12 official camps, according to the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
'Dear to me'
Shehadeh said her daughter, aged in her thirties, had been living in Lebanon in recent years but a few months ago ""her husband came and took her"" back to Gaza.
""She's moving around... I don't know what area she's in now,"" Shehadeh said, requesting the young woman not be identified by name.
More than 1.5 million people have been internally displaced in Gaza, and UN agencies have warned of rapidly deteriorating conditions.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini has described children sheltering at a UN school ""pleading for a sip of water or for a loaf of bread"".
On Friday, network provider Paltel group said communications with Gaza were severed due to a lack of fuel.
Shehadeh's family came to Lebanon from the Acre area, now in northern Israel, survivors of what Palestinians call the Nakba, or the ""catastrophe"", when more than 760,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes by the 1948 war over Israel's creation.
She said the family had feared for their lives, including after Jewish paramilitary groups massacred more than 100 Palestinian villagers at Deir Yassin, near Jerusalem, in April that year.
The elderly woman said if she could talk to her daughter, she would tell her not to cry.
""I want to tell her that her tears are dear to me,"" she said.
'Nothing left'
Beirut's dilapidated Burj al-Barajneh camp was partially destroyed in Israel's 1982 invasion of Beirut and during Lebanon's 15-year-long civil war, according to UNRWA.
In her small flat in the camp, Palestinian Fatima al-Ashwah, 61, is also glued to the television, praying her family members in Gaza are not among those being pulled dead from the rubble, or hoping to get a glimpse of them in footage of displaced people at shelters.
Originally from Al-Kabri, now in northern Israel, Ashwah has some 70 extended family members in Gaza, including her cousins and their families, the eldest in their seventies, the youngest just one year old.
They used to live in northern Gaza's Beit Hanoun, near the Erez crossing with Israel, Ashwah said, but now ""their houses are all gone... because they're on the front lines. There's nothing left.""
Israel has for more than a month been calling on the population in northern Gaza to evacuate south as it pushes ahead with its war against Hamas.
Ashwah's relatives have fled from place to place, with some now sheltering in schools near Gaza's southern Rafah crossing with Egypt.
She said sometimes she had been able to hear bombing during short telephone calls.
Her relatives have told her: ""'We're hungry, we're afraid, the children are afraid, they're terrified',"" she said.
""The situation breaks your heart,"" she said. ""I can't stand the sound of crying and screaming anymore"".
Fighting back tears, she recounted how she had visited Gaza in July, and how the family greeted her and another relative with drums and dancing in celebration at the Rafah crossing.
""God willing it will be over and Gaza will go back to how it was before,"" she said.

Israeli Strike on School Kills Al Jazeera Cameraman in Southern Gaza

An Israeli strike killed a Palestinian cameraman for the TV network Al Jazeera and wounded its chief Gaza correspondent Friday as they reported at a school in the south of the besieged territory, the network said.
Cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa and correspondent Wael Dahdouh had gone to the school in the southern city of Khan Younis after it was hit by a strike earlier in the day. While they were there, an Israeli drone hit the school with a second strike, the network said.
Dahdouh was heavily wounded in his arm and shoulder, while Abu Daqqa fell bleeding to the ground. Speaking from a hospital bed, Dahdouh told Al Jazeera he was able to flee, bleeding, from the school and found several ambulance workers. He asked them to look for Abu Daqqa, but they said it was too risky and promised another ambulance would come for him, Dahdouh said.
""He was screaming, he was calling for help,"" said Dahdouh, his right arm heavily bandaged.
Later that evening, Al Jazeera reported that an ambulance tried to reach the school to evacuate Abu Daqqa, but it had to turn back because roads were blocked by the rubble of destroyed houses.
Abu Daqqa continued to bleed for several more hours, until a civil defense crew found him dead, the network said in a statement.
Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour told a General Assembly meeting on the war that Israel ""targets those who could document (their) crimes and inform the world, the journalists.""
""We mourn one of those journalists, Samer Abu Daqqa, wounded in an Israeli drone strike and left to bleed to death for 6 hours while ambulances were prevented from reaching him,"" Mansour said.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Abu Daqqa is the 64th journalist to be killed since the conflict erupted between Hamas and Israel: 57 Palestinians, four Israelis and three Lebanese journalists.
The 45-year-old Abu Daqqa, a Khan Younis native, joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as both a cameraman and an editor. He leaves behind a daughter and three sons.
The Israeli army did not immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment about Abu Daqqa's death.
The Foreign Press Association, which represents several hundred journalists working for international news organizations including The Associated Press in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, said it grieves the death of Abu Daqqa, a longtime member.
""He is the first FPA member to be killed in Gaza in the war,"" the organization said in a statement. ""We consider this a grave blow to the already limited freedom of the press in Gaza and call on the army for a prompt investigation and explanation.""
Qatari-owned Al Jazeera said in a statement that it holds Israel ""accountable for systematically targeting and killing Al Jazeera journalists and their families.""
In late October, Dahdouh's wife, son, daughter and grandchild were killed in a strike on the home where they were sheltering in central Gaza. The network at the time accused Israel of intentionally targeting his family.
Earlier this month, a strike killed the father, mother and 20 other family members of another Al Jazeera correspondent, Momen Al Sharafi.
Dahdouh is well known as the face of Palestinians during many wars. He is revered in his native Gaza for telling stories of suffering and hardship to the outside world.
Israel's air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. The war broke out following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel in which militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took some 240 hostage.

Israeli tanks and warplanes struck at southern Gaza on Tuesday, while the United Nations said aid supplies to desperate Palestinians had largely dried up because of the intensity of fighting in the Israel-Hamas war, now in its third month.
In Khan Younis, southern Gaza's main city which Israel troops stormed last week, residents said tank shelling was now focused on the city center. One said tanks were operating on Tuesday morning in the street where the house of Yahya Al-Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza, is located.
At the United Nations, the 193-member UN General Assembly was preparing to vote on a resolution calling for a ceasefire. Diplomats said it was expected to pass. The United States vetoed a similar call in the 15-member Security Council last week.
In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that following an ""intensive dialogue"" with US President Joe Biden, Israel had received full backing for its ground incursion into Gaza and blocking the international pressure to stop the war.
Washington has backed Israel's position that a ceasefire would only benefit Hamas, although it has also called on its ally to do more to limit harm to civilians.
Israel's assault on Gaza to root out Hamas has killed at least 18,205 Palestinians and wounded nearly 50,000 since Oct. 7, according to the Gaza health ministry. Many more dead are uncounted under the rubble or beyond the reach of ambulances.
An elderly Palestinian, Tawfik Abu Breika, said his residential block in Khan Younis was hit without warning by an Israeli air strike on Tuesday that had brought down several buildings and caused casualties.
""The world's conscience is dead, no humanity or any kind of morals,"" Breika told Reuters as neighbors sifted through rubble. ""This is the third month that we are facing death and destruction ... This is ethnic cleansing, complete destruction of the Gaza Strip to displace the whole population.""
Further south in Rafah, which borders Egypt, health officials said 22 people including children were killed in an Israeli air strike on houses overnight. Civil emergency workers were searching for more victims under the rubble.
Residents said the shelling of Rafah, where the Israeli army this month ordered people to head for their safety, was some of the heaviest in days.
""At night we can't sleep because of the bombing and in the morning we tour the streets looking for food for the children, there is no food,"" said Abu Khalil, 40, a father of six.
Gazans were battling hunger and thirst to survive, resident Mohammed Obaid said as he inspected debris in Rafah.
""There's no electricity, no fuel, no water, no medicine.""
Rocket fire
Israel mounted the assault on Gaza in response to a cross-border raid by Hamas fighters in which they killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostage in southern Israel on Oct. 7. More than 100 hostages were freed during the truce in November.
One hundred and five Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ground invasion began in late October.
Israel's military said that over the past day it hit several posts that were used to fire rockets at its territory, raided a Hamas compound where it found some 250 rockets among other weapons, and struck a weapon production factory.
An Israeli ground assault that had been confined to the north has expanded to the southern half of the Gaza Strip since a week-long truce collapsed at the start of December.
Residents and aid agencies say that means no place is now safe in a territory where bombing has already rendered the vast majority of people homeless and nearly all areas entirely cut off from food, medicine and fuel.
Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said Israeli forces had raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza on Tuesday and detained the hospital director, Dr. Ahmed Al-Kahlout, along with all medical staff, including female teams.
They were being interrogated under threat within the emergency department, he said. Israel's military did not reply to a request for comment on the incident.
An air strike on a house in Rafah killed several people and another on a building near the center in Khan Younis killed one Palestinian, medics said.
Hunger is worsening, with the UN World Food Program saying half of Gaza's population is starving.
The UN humanitarian office OCHA said on Tuesday limited aid distributions were taking place in the Rafah district, but ""in the rest of the Gaza Strip, aid distribution has largely stopped over the past few days, due to the intensity of hostilities and restrictions of movement along the main roads"".
New aid screening system
UN officials say at least 1.9 million people - 85% of Gaza's population - are now displaced. Some of those sheltering in Rafah have erected tents of wood and nylon in open areas. Some are sleeping in the streets.
To increase the aid reaching Gaza, Israel said on Monday it would add shipment screening at the Kerem Shalom border crossing, without opening the crossing itself.
Most trucks entered Gaza at this crossing before the war. They are now limited to the Rafah crossing from Egypt. Egyptian security sources said inspections would begin on Tuesday under a new deal between Israel, Egypt and the United States.
The UN Palestinian Refugee Agency (UNRWA) said Israel had imposed a near-total siege on Gaza ""inflicting collective punishment on over 2 million people, half of whom are children"".
The Palestinian foreign minister accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war, a charge an Israeli official rejected as ""obscene"".
Netanyahu said that in his talks with Biden, there was disagreement about the plan for Gaza after Hamas was defeated but he hoped to reach agreement on that as well.
""After the great sacrifice of our civilians and our soldiers, I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who ... support terrorism and finance terrorism,"" he said.
Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said the UN General Assembly vote on Tuesday would be a vote ""to keep the Hamas terror regime in power and shield it from the consequences of 10/7"".

Israeli forces and Hezbollah traded fire across the Israel-Lebanon border on Sunday for the third consecutive day and Israel said several of its soldiers were hurt.
The Israeli military said its soldiers were ""lightly injured"" when an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon hit a vehicle in the Beit Hillel area of northern Israel.
Eleven people - eight soldiers and three civilians - were wounded by Hezbollah fire in the area of Beit Hillel, army radio reported.
Israeli forces fired artillery in return, the military's statement read.
It also said its fighter jets struck other Hezbollah targets.
Hezbollah said it had targeted a number of Israeli positions with what it called ""appropriate weapons.""
Following the eruption of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah mounted near-daily rocket attacks on Israeli positions at the frontier while Israel launched air and artillery strikes in south Lebanon. But the border was largely calm during a week-long truce in Gaza that collapsed on Friday.
Just over 100 people in Lebanon have been reported killed during the hostilities, 83 of them Hezbollah fighters. Tens of thousands of people have fled both sides of the border.

Heavy Fighting in Gaza Halts Most Aid Delivery, Leaves Civilians with Few Places to Seek Safety
Asharq Alawsat (English Edition)

Intense fighting blocked relief workers from distributing food, water and medicine across most of the Gaza Strip, deepening the humanitarian crisis as Israeli forces battled Hamas militants Wednesday in a ground offensive that has brought some of the devastation and mass displacement seen in the north to the south.
As the focus of the offensive moves down the Gaza Strip and into the second-largest city of Khan Younis, it is further shrinking the area where Palestinians can seek safety and pushing large numbers of people, many of whom have been forced to flee multiple times, toward the sealed-off border with Egypt.
On the Gaza side of the border, makeshift shelters and family homes are already overflowing and many people are sleeping in the streets. On the other side, Egypt has refused any mass influx of refugees, saying it believes Israel will not let them back into Gaza and that the two countries' decades-old peace treaty would be undermined.
The UN says some 1.87 million people - over 80% of the population of 2.3 million - have already fled their homes. Many Palestinians fear they will not be allowed to return.
Much of the north, including large parts of Gaza City, has been completely destroyed, and Palestinians worry the rest of Gaza could suffer a similar fate as Israel tries to dismantle Hamas, which has deep roots in the territory it has ruled for 16 years.
Two months of Israeli bombardment and ground assaults have killed more than 16,200 people in Gaza - most of them women and children - and wounded more than 42,000, the territory's Health Ministry said late Tuesday. It has said many are also trapped under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
Israel has vowed to fight on, saying it can no longer accept Hamas rule or the group's military presence in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Hamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took captive some 240 men, women and children in that attack.
An estimated 138 hostages remain in Gaza after more than 100 were freed during a ceasefire last week. Their plight, and accounts of rape and other atrocities committed during the rampage, have deepened Israel's outrage and further galvanized support for the war.
PUSHED TO THE EDGE The war has been an unprecedented catastrophe for Palestinian civilians, eclipsing all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas, and their suffering is set to worsen as the offensive grinds on.
For the past three days, aid distribution - mainly just supplies of flour and water - has been possible only in and around Rafah, on the border with Egypt, because of fighting and road closures by Israeli forces, the UN's humanitarian aid office said.
It said tens of thousands of people have fled into Rafah from Khan Younis and other areas, overwhelming already overcrowded shelters.
""You find displaced people in the streets, in schools, in mosques, in hospitals ... everywhere,"" said Hamza Abu Mustafa, a teacher who lives near a school-turned-shelter in Rafah and is hosting three families himself.
""The situation is extremely dire,"" he said.
A Palestinian woman who identified herself as Umm Ahmed said the harsh conditions and limited access to toilets are especially difficult for women who are pregnant or menstruating. Some have taken to social media to request menstrual pads, which are increasingly hard to find.
""For women and girls, the suffering is double,"" Umm Ahmed said. ""It's more humiliation.""
The humanitarian crisis gets even worse farther north, where aid supplies can no longer reach.
People in UN-run shelters in Khan Younis are fighting over food, said Nawraz Abu Libdeh, who is living in a shelter after being displaced six times. ""The hunger war has started,"" he said. ""This is the worst of all wars.""
The World Food Program warned that the renewed fighting ""will only intensify the catastrophic hunger crisis that already threatens to overwhelm the civilian population.""
In the central town of Deir al-Balah, the aid group Doctors Without Borders said fuel and medical supplies have reached ""critically low levels"" at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Up to 200 wounded people have been brought in every day since Dec. 1, when the weeklong truce expired, it said.
""Without electricity, ventilators would cease to function, blood donations would have to stop, the sterilization of surgical instruments would be impossible,"" said Marie-Aure Perreaut Revial, the aid group's emergency coordinator in Gaza. She said they are also running low on surgical supplies and equipment to stabilize broken bones.
Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine, fuel and other supplies into Gaza, except for a trickle of aid from Egypt. Gaza has been without electricity since the first week of the war, and several hospitals have been forced to shut down for lack of fuel to operate emergency generators.
NO END IN SIGHT The Gaza Health Ministry's death toll for Palestinians tracks with a figure released this week by the Israeli military, which said about 5,000 of the dead were militants, without saying how it arrived at its count.
The military says 88 of its soldiers have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive.
It accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields when the militants operate in residential areas. But Israel has not given detailed accounts of individual strikes, some of which have leveled entire city blocks.
The Israeli military said Tuesday that its troops were ""in the heart"" of Khan Younis after what it described as ""the most intense day"" of fighting since the start of the ground operation five weeks ago, with heavy battles in the north as well.
Hamas' continuing ability to fight in areas where Israel entered with overwhelming force weeks ago signals that eradicating the group without causing further mass casualties and displacement - as Israel's top ally, the US, has requested - could prove elusive.
Even after weeks of bombardment, Hamas' top leader in Gaza, Yehya Sinwar - whose location is unknown - was able to conduct complex ceasefire negotiations and orchestrate the release of scores of hostages last week. Palestinian militants have also kept up their rocket fire into Israel.

Israel Battles Militants in Gaza's Main Cities, with Civilians Trapped in the Fighting

Palestinians dug under crushed buildings Monday to recover the bodies of families killed in strikes around Gaza as Israeli forces battled militants in the territory's two largest cities, where many thousands of civilians are still trapped by the fighting.
Residents said battles went on in and around the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli ground forces opened a new line of attack last week. Battles were also still underway in parts of Gaza City and the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza, where large areas have been reduced to rubble.
Israel has pledged to keep fighting until it removes Hamas from power, dismantles its military capabilities and gets back all of the hostages taken by militants during Hamas' Oct. 7 surprise attack into Israel that ignited the war. The Israeli campaign has killed thousands of Palestinian civilians and driven nearly 85% of the territory's 2.3 million people from their homes.
In central Gaza, an Israeli airstrike overnight flattened a residential building where some 80 people were staying in the Maghazi refugee camp, residents said.
Ahmed al-Qarah, a neighbor who was digging through the rubble for survivors, said he knew of only six people who made it out. ""The rest are under the building,"" he said. At a nearby hospital, family members sobbed over the bodies of several of the dead from the strike.
In Khan Younis, Radwa Abu Frayeh saw heavy Israeli strikes overnight around the European Hospital, where the UN humanitarian office says tens of thousands of people have sought shelter. She said one hit a home close to hers late Sunday.
""The building shook,"" she said. ""We thought it was the end and we would die.""
Hussein al-Sayyed, who fled Gaza City earlier in the war with his three daughters, is staying in a three-story home in the city with around 70 others. He said they have been rationing food for days. ""I don't know where to go,"" he said. ""No place is safe.""
Hamas on Monday fired a barrage of rockets that set off sirens in Tel Aviv. One person was lightly wounded, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service. Israel's Channel 12 television broadcast footage of a cratered road and damage to cars and buildings in a suburb.
FIERCE FIGHTING In northern Gaza, Israeli forces and militants have been fighting in the refugee camp of Jabaliya and the Gaza City district of Shijaiya.
Large swaths of Gaza City and other parts of the north have been obliterated by weeks of bombardment and fighting, but tens of thousands of people are believed to remain, huddled in homes, UN shelters and hospitals.
The UN humanitarian office, known as OCHA, described a harrowing journey through the battle zone by a UN and Red Crescent convoy over the weekend that made the first delivery of medical supplies to the north in more than a week. It said an ambulance and UN truck were hit by gunfire on the way to Al-Ahly Hospital to drop off the supplies.
The convoy then evacuated 19 patients but was delayed for inspections by Israeli forces on the way south. OCHA said one patient died, and a paramedic was detained for hours, interrogated and reportedly beaten.
The fighting in Jabaliya has trapped hundreds of staff, patients and displaced people inside a number of hospitals, most of them unable to function.
Two staff members were killed over the weekend by clashes outside Al-Awda Hospital, OCHA said. Shelling and live ammunition hit Al-Yemen Al-Saeed Hospital, killing an unknown number of displaced people sheltering inside, it said. It did not say which side was behind the fire.
Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on Hamas, saying it endangers residents by fighting in dense areas and positioning weapons, tunnels and rocket launchers in or near civilian buildings.
The military said five soldiers were killed Sunday in a battle in southern Gaza after militants fired at them from a school and set off an explosive device. Military officials said the troops, backed by aircraft and tanks, returned fire and killed the militants.
HARSH CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH With Israel allowing little aid into Gaza and the UN largely unable to distribute it amid the fighting, Palestinians face severe shortages of food, water and other basic goods.
Israel has urged people to flee to what it says are safe areas in the south. The fighting in and around Khan Younis has pushed tens of thousands toward the town of Rafah and other areas along the border with Egypt.
Still, airstrikes have continued even in areas to which Palestinians are told to flee. A strike in Rafah early Monday heavily damaged a residential building, killing at least nine people, all but one of them women, according to Associated Press reporters who saw the bodies at the hospital.
The aid group Doctors Without Borders said people in the south are also falling ill as they pack into crowded shelters or sleep in tents in open areas.
Nicholas Papachrysostomou, the group's emergency coordinator in Gaza, said ""every other patient"" at a clinic in Rafah has a respiratory infection after prolonged exposure to cold and rain.
""In some shelters, 600 people share a single toilet. We are already seeing many cases of diarrhea. Often children are the worst affected,"" he said.
With almost all of Gaza's 2.3 million people crowded in the south, some worry that Palestinians will be forced out of the territory altogether in a repeat of the mass exodus from what is now Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation.
""Expect public order to completely break down soon, and an even worse situation could unfold, including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into Egypt,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a forum in Qatar on Sunday.
Eylon Levy, an Israeli government spokesman, called allegations that Israeli intends to drive people from Gaza ""outrageous and false."" But other Israeli officials have discussed such a scenario, raising alarm in Egypt and other Arab countries that refuse to accept any refugees.
Palestinians in Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied West Bank observed a general strike Monday called by activists to demand a ceasefire, after the US vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for one on Friday. A similar, nonbinding vote is planned in the General Assembly on Tuesday.
The US has provided unwavering diplomatic and military support for the campaign, even as it has urged Israel to minimize civilian casualties and further mass displacement.
With the war in its third month, the Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 17,900, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-controlled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
Some 1,300 people have died on the Israeli side, mostly civilians killed during the Oct. 7 attack. The toll also includes 104 soldiers who have been killed in the Gaza ground offensive since late October.
During the Oct. 7 attack, militants took more than 240 people captive. After exchanges during a weeklong ceasefire last month. Israel says Hamas still has 117 hostages and the remains of 20 people who died in captivity or during the initial attack.

Hezbollah Fires Rockets at Israel after Airstrike Kills Senior Fighters

The security situation in southern Lebanon has reached alarming levels after Hezbollah carried out 22 military operations on Thursday, a day after an Israeli airstrike on a home killed six of the group's senior fighters.
The waves of rockets sent over the border represented one of the most intense bombardments since Hezbollah started attacking Israeli posts in the country's north at the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war.
Hezbollah said in a series of statements released Thursday that the volleys it fired toward Israeli posts included 48 Katyusha rockets that were directed at an Israeli army base in Beit Zeitem, about 10 kilometers south of the border.
In another attack, Hezbollah said its fighters monitored four Israeli soldiers as they took positions inside a house in the Manara Kibbutz then fired an anti-tank missile that destroyed the house and killed the soldiers.
Hezbollah released around 22 statements claiming attacks on Thursday alone making it a record in one day since the fighting began last month. The group said its fighters also struck Israeli tanks.
The intense fire followed an Israeli airstrike on a house in Beit Yahoun, a village in southern Lebanon, that killed five senior fighters, including Abbas Raad, the son of the head of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc in Lebanon, Mohammed Raad.
The death toll rose to six when Hezbollah issued another statement before the funeral of the slain fighters.
Two leaders of Hezbollah's elite Al-Radwan force were among the five killed, a source close to the group told Agence France Presse.

UN Says Starvation Imminent in Gaza, No Let-up in Israeli Assault

UN aid deliveries to Gaza were suspended on Friday due to shortages of fuel and a communications shut down, deepening the misery of thousands of hungry and homeless Palestinians as Israeli troops battled Hamas militants in the enclave.
The United Nations' World Food Program (WFP) said civilians faced the ""immediate possibility of starvation"" due to the lack of food supplies.
International officials say a humanitarian crisis for the 2.3 million residents of Gaza is entering a new, more dire phase as war enters its seventh week.
Israel has vowed to annihilate the Hamas militant group that controls Gaza, since its fighters killed 1,200 people and dragged away 240 hostages on a deadly rampage on Oct. 7.
Since then, Israel has bombed much of Gaza to rubble, ordered the depopulation of the entire northern half of the enclave and made around two-thirds of Gazans homeless.
Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say more than 11,500 people are confirmed dead, 40% of them children, with many others trapped under rubble. They have not been able to update that toll for several days because of a lack of communications.
At Gaza's biggest hospital Al Shifa, focus of international alarm this week as a primary target of Israel's ground assault, Israel said its forces had found a vehicle with a large number of weapons, and an underground structure it called a Hamas tunnel shaft, after two days searching the premises.
The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of the hospital, littered with concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated. A bulldozer appeared in the background.
The army also said it had found the bodies of two hostages in buildings near, though not inside, the hospital grounds.
Israel has long maintained that the hospital sat above a vast underground bunker housing a Hamas command headquarters. Hospital staff say this is false and that Israel's findings there have so far established no such thing.
Hamas denies using hospitals for military purposes. It says some hostages have received treatment at medical centers but they have not been held inside them.
Al Shifa staff said a premature baby died at the hospital on Friday, the first baby to die there in the two days since Israeli forces entered.
Three had died in the previous days while the hospital was surrounded.
Israel had said it would send help including incubators to rescue 36 babies being kept eight-to-a-bed to keep warm since the neo-natal ward was knocked out last week. But staff said the Israelis allowed in no meaningful aid for the babies or hundreds of other patients and thousands of displaced people trapped inside the compound while Israeli commandos search it.
Five babies were in a very serious condition, Al Shifa hospital compound director Muhammad Abu Salmiya told Al Jazeera.
""We are trying to keep them alive, wrapping them in cellophane, putting bottles of hot water near them to keep them alive, our attempts are what is keeping them alive.""
Communication with outside organizations had been cut and pleas to evacuate those in most desperate condition had gone unanswered, he said.
""There is nothing in the hospital except more dead bodies, there isn't any kind of life necessities in the hospital, no electricity, no water, no oxygen, no food. The Israeli army is wandering around freely in the hospital. The hospital is besieged from everywhere, tanks surround us from everywhere.""
The last hospital fully functioning in the northern half of Gaza, Al Ahli, was forced to close its surgery department after it ran out of anesthetics. British-Palestinian surgeon Ghassan Abu Sitta, who escaped on foot to the south, told Reuters he had decided to leave because he was now powerless to help patients.
""It has been a living nightmare - leaving 500 wounded knowing that there's nothing left for you to be able to do for them, it's just the most heartbreaking thing I ever had to do,"" Abu Sitta said by phone.
Homes destroyed
With the war about to enter its seventh week, there was no sign of any let-up despite international calls for a ceasefire or at least for humanitarian pauses.
Israel's military, which has concentrated its assault on northern Gaza, said its troops and war planes were keeping up pressure on Friday.
Overnight they took control of an Islamic Jihad commander's stronghold, the military said, and also killed Hamas fighters inside a school where they found a large number of weapons.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), quoting Palestinian data, said Israeli attacks had destroyed or damaged at least 45% of Gaza's housing units.
The United Nations said there would be no cross-border aid operation on Friday due to fuel shortages and a communication shutdown. For a second consecutive day no aid trucks arrived in Gaza due to lack of fuel for distributing relief.
An Israeli official said later on Friday that Israel's war cabinet had approved letting in two fuel trucks a day into Gaza to help meet UN needs, following a US request.
Humanitarian crisis
Nearly the entire Gazan population is in desperate need of food assistance, said WFP Executive Director Cindy McCain.
""With winter fast approaching, unsafe and overcrowded shelters, and the lack of clean water, civilians are facing the immediate possibility of starvation,"" she said in a statement.
A UN human rights official said Israel must allow water and fuel into Gaza to restart the water supply network otherwise people would die of thirst and disease. Israel's actions were a breach of international law, Pedro Arrojo-Agudo said.
The World Health Organization said it feared the spread of disease, including respiratory infections and diarrhea.
The Israeli military's chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas' military system in the north of the coastal enclave.
In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Hamas' Al-Quds Brigades said they had engaged Israeli forces for several hours in the city of Jenin overnight.
Israel's military said war planes struck militants in Jenin who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers and at least five militants were killed.
At least 178 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. The violence there has underscored fears that the territory, seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War, could spiral out of control in tandem with the conflict in Gaza.

Israeli Forces Storm Khan Younis in South Gaza, Killing Scores of Palestinians

Israeli forces stormed southern Gaza's main city on Tuesday in what they called the most intense day of combat in five weeks of ground operations against Hamas militants, and hospitals struggled to cope with scores of Palestinian dead and wounded.
In what appeared to be the biggest ground assault in Gaza since a truce with Hamas unraveled last week, Israel said its forces - which were backed by warplanes - had reached the heart of Khan Younis.
""We are in the most intense day since the beginning of the ground operation,"" the commander of the Israeli military's Southern Command, General Yaron Finkelman, said in Jerusalem.
He said Israeli forces were also fighting in Jabalia, a large urban refugee camp and Hamas stronghold in northern Gaza next to Gaza City, and in Shuja'iyya, east of the city.
""We are in the heart of Jabalia, in the heart of Shuja'iyya, and now also in the heart of Khan Younis,"" he said.
Khan Younis residents said Israeli troops and tanks had crossed through the Israeli border fence enclosing the coastal Gaza Strip and closed in on the city from the east.
After days of ordering residents to flee the area, Israeli forces dropped new leaflets on Tuesday with instructions to stay inside shelters during the assault.
""For your safety, stay in the shelters and the hospitals where you are. Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned,"" said the leaflets, addressed to residents of six districts amounting to around a quarter of Khan Younis.
The Israelis, who largely seized Gaza's northern half last month before pausing for the week-long truce, say they are now extending their ground offensive to the south. They believe Hamas commanders they aim to eliminate are holed up in part of a vast tunnel network in the territory.
""We're moving ahead with the second stage now. A second stage that is going to be difficult militarily,"" Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said.
Israel, he added, is open to ""constructive feedback"" on reducing harm to civilians as long as the advice is consistent with its aim of destroying Gaza's ruling Islamist movement.
Rising death toll
Palestinian health officials said large numbers of people had been killed in a strike on houses in Deir al-Balah, north of Khan Younis. Dr Eyad Al-Jabri, head of the Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital there, told Reuters at least 45 people had been killed.
Reuters was unable to reach the area or confirm the toll.
Israel launched its campaign in retribution for an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas fighters who rampaged through Israeli towns, killing 1,200 people and seizing 240 hostages, according to Israel's tally.
According to Gaza health officials, more than 15,900 Palestinians are confirmed to have been killed by Israeli air and strikes and other actions, with thousands more missing and feared buried under rubble.
Israeli bombardments have driven 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million residents from their homes, most fleeing south. Crowded southern areas are now sheltering triple their usual population.
At Khan Younis' main Nasser hospital, the wounded arrived by ambulance, car, flatbed truck and donkey cart after what survivors described as a strike on a school being used as a shelter for the displaced.
Inside a ward, almost every inch of floor space was taken up by the wounded, medics hurrying from patient to patient while relatives wailed.
A doctor carried the small limp body of a dead boy in a tracksuit and placed him in a corner, arms splayed across the blood-smeared tile. On the floor nearby, surrounded by discarded bandages and rubber gloves, lay a wounded boy and girl, their limbs tangled with the stands holding IV drips in their arms.
Two young girls were being treated, still covered in dust from the collapse of the house that had buried their family.
""My parents are under the rubble,"" sobbed one. ""I want my mum, I want my mum, I want my family.""
Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashra al-Qidra said at least 43 corpses had already reached Nasser hospital that morning and that hospitals in southern Gaza Strip were ""totally collapsing"".
Washington urges less harm to civilians
The United States has urged close ally Israel to do more to reduce harm to civilians in the war's next phase.
Israel says the blame falls on Hamas fighters for operating among civilians, including from underground tunnels that can be destroyed only with huge bombs. Hamas denies using human shields.
Since the truce collapsed, Israel has been posting an online map to tell Gazans which parts of the enclave to evacuate. Khan Younis' eastern quarter was marked on Monday, home to hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom took flight on foot.
Gazans say there is no safe place, with remaining towns and shelters already overwhelmed, and Israel continuing to bomb the areas where it is telling people to go.
James Elder, spokesperson for UN children's agency UNICEF, said the few small areas designated ""safe"" by Israel were merely ""tiny patches of barren land"", street corners, sidewalks or half-built buildings unsuitable for the hundreds of thousands of people in desperate need of shelter.

Israeli Offensive Shifts to Crowded Southern Gaza, Driving up Death Toll Despite Evacuation Orders

Israel pounded targets in the crowded southern half of the Gaza Strip on Saturday and ordered more neighborhoods designated for attack to evacuate, driving up the death toll even as the United States and others urged it to do more to protect Gaza civilians a day after a truce collapsed.
At least 200 Palestinians have been killed since the fighting resumed Friday morning following the weeklong truce with the territory's ruling militant group Hamas, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. Several homes were hit across Gaza on Saturday, with multiple casualties reported in a strike that flattened a multi-story building on the outskirts of Gaza City.
Separately, the ministry announced that the overall death toll in Gaza since the Oct. 7 start of the Israel-Hamas war surpassed 15,200, a sharp jump from the previous count of more than 13,300 on Nov. 20. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it said 70% of the dead were women and children. It also said more than 40,000 people had been wounded since the war began.
The appeal from the United States, Israel's closest ally, to do more to protect civilians came after an air and ground offensive in the first weeks of the war devastated large areas of northern Gaza. Some 2 million Palestinians, almost the entire population of Gaza, are now crammed into the territory's southern half.
Israel's military said Saturday that it had hit more than 400 Hamas targets across Gaza over the past day, using airstrikes and shelling from tanks and navy gunships. It included more than 50 strikes in the city of Khan Younis and surrounding areas in southern Gaza.
At least nine people, including three children, were killed in a strike on a house in Deir al-Balah city in the south, according to the hospital where the bodies were taken. The hospital also received seven bodies of others killed in overnight airstrikes, including two children.
In northern Gaza, an airstrike flattened a residential building hosting displaced families in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya on the outskirts of Gaza City. The strike left dozens dead or wounded, said residents Hamza Obeid and Amal Radwan.
""There was a loud bang, then the building turned into a pile of rubble,"" Obeid said. AP video showed smoke rising from a fire as men, some in sandals, picked their way over the debris. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli army spokesperson, confirmed that the Israeli military was operating in Jabaliya.
Meanwhile, Palestinian militant groups in Gaza said they fired a barrage of rockets on southern Israel. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. Lerner said Hamas had launched more than 250 rockets at Israel since the ceasefire ended.
In the clearest sign yet that a return to negotiations for further truces was unlikely, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed negotiators to return to Israel.
With the resumption of fighting, the Israeli military published an online map carving up the Gaza Strip into hundreds of numbered parcels and asked residents to familiarize themselves with the number of their location ahead of evacuation warnings.
On Saturday, the military listed more than two dozen parcel numbers in areas around Gaza City in the north and east of Khan Younis. Separately, it dropped leaflets with evacuation orders over towns east of Khan Younis.
One Khan Younis resident said a neighbor received a call from the Israeli army warning that houses in the area would be hit and everyone should leave. ""We told them, 'We have nothing here, why do you want to strike it?'"" said the resident, Hikmat al-Qidra. Al-Qidra said the house was destroyed.
The maps and leaflets generated panic and confusion, especially in the crowded south. Unable to go to northern Gaza or neighboring Egypt, their only escape is to move around within the 220-square-kilometer (85-square-mile) area.
""There is no place to go,"" said Emad Hajar, who fled with his wife and three children from the north a month ago to Khan Younis. ""They expelled us from the north, and now they are pushing us to leave the south.""
Amal Radwan, who sheltered in the Jabaliya refugee camp, said she wasn't aware of such a map, adding that she and many others were not able to leave because of the relentless bombardment.
Mark Regev, a senior advisor to Netanyahu, said Israel was making ""maximum effort to safeguard Gazan civilians"" and the military has used leafleting, phone calls, and radio and TV broadcasts to urge Gazans to move from specific areas. ""We've not asked the whole population of the south to relocate,"" he said.
Regev added that Israel is considering a future security buffer zone that would not allow Gazans direct access to the border fence on foot, adding that Israel does not plan to annex any territory from Gaza.
Israel says it is targeting Hamas operatives and blames civilian casualties on the militants, accusing them of operating in residential neighborhoods. It claims to have killed thousands of militants, without providing evidence. Israel says 77 of its soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive in northern Gaza.
Also Saturday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received the first convoy of aid trucks through the Rafah crossing since fighting resumed. Wael Abu Omar, a spokesman for the Palestinian Crossings Authority, said a convoy of 100 trucks entered Gaza, including three carrying 150,000 liters (nearly 40,000 gallons) of fuel.
""Current conditions do not allow for a meaningful humanitarian response, and I fear will spell disaster for the civilian population,"" Pascal Hundt, in charge of operations in Gaza for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said.
Meanwhile, US Vice President Kamala Harris, in Dubai on Saturday for the COP28 climate conference, said in a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that ""under no circumstances"" would the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza or redrawing of its borders, according to a US summary.
Harris was expected to outline proposals with regional leaders to ""put Palestinian voices at the center"" of planning the next steps for Gaza after the conflict, according to the White House. President Joe Biden's administration has emphasized the need for an eventual two-state solution, with Israel and a Palestinian state coexisting.
The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in southern Israel, and around 240 people were taken captive.
The renewed hostilities have heightened concerns for 136 hostages who, according to the Israeli military, are still held by Hamas and other militants after 105 were freed during the truce. A 70-year-old woman held by Hamas was declared dead on Saturday, according to her kibbutz, bringing the total number of known dead hostages to eight.
During the truce, Israel freed 240 Palestinians from its prisons. Most of those released by both sides were women and children.
The truce's end also saw new activity along Israel's northern border. Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said its fighters attacked at least five Israeli posts along the border, and Israeli forces struck several areas on the Lebanese side. There were no reports of casualties.

Hamas Frees First Batch of Hostages under Truce, Including 13 Israelis

Hamas released the first batch of hostages under a ceasefire deal that began Friday, including 13 Israelis who have been held in the Gaza Strip since the militant group staged a raid on Israel nearly seven weeks ago, according to officials and media reports.
Twelve Thai nationals were also released, according to Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. Dozens of Palestinian prisoners are also expected to be freed by Israel.
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began Friday, setting the stage for the exchange and allowing sorely needed aid to start flowing into Gaza.
There were no reports of fighting after the truce began. The deal offered some relief for Gaza's 2.3 million people, who have endured weeks of Israeli bombardment and dwindling supplies of basic necessities, as well as for families in Israel worried about loved ones taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which triggered the war.
The truce raised hopes of eventually winding down the conflict, which has flattened vast swaths of Gaza, fueled a surge of violence in the occupied West Bank and stirred fears of a wider conflagration across the Middle East. Israel, however, has said it is determined to resume its massive offensive once the ceasefire ends.
Under the deal, Gaza's ruling Hamas group pledged to free at least 50 of the about 240 hostages it and other militants took in the Oct. 7 raid. In exchange, Hamas said Israel would free 150 Palestinian prisoners.
Both sides agreed to release women and children first, in stages starting Friday, and as planned 13 Israelis were released, according to Israeli media, citing security officials. An Israeli official, meanwhile, confirmed that the Thai captives left Gaza and were en route to a hospital in Israel. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to discuss the releases with the media.
Israel said the deal calls for the truce to be extended an extra day for every additional 10 hostages freed.
Early in the day, ambulances were seen arriving at the Hatzerim air base in southern Israel, preparing for the release. Those freed will then be taken to hospitals for assessment and treatment, Israeli officials said.
Among the Israeli citizens freed some have a second nationality, according to a Hamas official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the details with the media.
Israel's Justice Ministry published a list of 300 Palestinian prisoners eligible for release. Thirty-nine - 24 women, including some convicted of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers jailed for offenses like throwing stones - were expected to be freed Friday, Palestinian authorities said.
On Friday, the truce brought quiet after weeks in which Gaza saw heavy bombardment and artillery fire daily as well as street fighting as ground troops advanced through neighborhoods in the north. The last report of air raid sirens in Israeli towns near the territory came shortly after the truce took effect.
Not long after, four tankers with fuel and four with cooking gas entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt, Israel said.
Israel has agreed to allow the delivery of 130,000 liters (34,340 gallons) of fuel per day during the truce - still only a small portion of Gaza's estimated daily needs of more than 1 million liters.
For most of the past seven weeks of war, Israel had barred the entry of fuel to Gaza, claiming it could be used by Hamas for military purposes - though it has occasionally allowed small amounts in.
UN aid agencies pushed back against the claim, saying fuel deliveries were closely supervised and urgently needed to avert a humanitarian catastrophe since fuel is required to run generators that power water treatment facilities, hospitals and other critical infrastructure.
The Israeli military dropped leaflets over southern Gaza, warning hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians who sought refuge there not to return to their homes in the territory's north, the focus of Israel's ground offensive.
Even though Israel warned that it would block such attempts, hundreds of Palestinians could be seen walking north Friday.
Two were shot and killed by Israeli troops and another 11 were wounded. An Associated Press journalist saw the two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at a hospital.
Sofian Abu Amer, who had fled Gaza City, said he decided to risk heading north to check on his home.
""We don't have enough clothes, food and drinks,"" he said. ""The situation is disastrous. It's better for a person to die.""
The hope is that ""momentum"" from the deal will lead to an ""end to this violence,"" said Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Qatar, which served as a mediator along with the United States and Egypt.
But hours before it came into effect, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was quoted telling troops that their respite would be short and that the war would resume with intensity for at least two more months.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also vowed to continue the war to destroy Hamas' military capabilities, end its 16-year rule in Gaza and return all the hostages.
Israel's northern border with Lebanon was also quiet on Friday, a day after the militant Hezbollah group, an ally of Hamas, carried out the highest number of attacks in one day since fighting there began Oct. 8.
Hezbollah is not a party to the ceasefire agreement, but was widely expected to halt its attacks.
The war erupted when several thousand Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking scores of hostages, including babies, women and older adults, as well as soldiers.
The soldiers will only be released in exchange for all Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, according to the Islamic Jihad militant group, which is reportedly holding about 40 hostages.
It is not clear how many of the hostages are currently serving in the military or whether the militants also consider reserve soldiers to be ""military hostages.""
According to the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, an advocacy group, Israel is currently holding 7,200 Palestinians on security charges or convictions, including about 2,000 arrested since the start of the war.
The Israeli offensive has killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which resumed its detailed count of casualties in Gaza after stopping for weeks because of the health system's collapse in the north.
The ministry says some 6,000 people have been reported missing, feared buried under rubble.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its death tolls. Women and minors have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead, though the new number was not broken down. The figure does not include updated numbers from hospitals in the north.
Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters, without presenting evidence for its count.

Israeli Airstrikes on Lebanon Kill 2 Journalists, 4 Palestinian Militants

An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday killed two journalists who were reporting for a Beirut-based TV station on military activity along the border with Israel, according to Lebanese officials and the broadcaster. A separate strike killed four militants with the Palestinian group Hamas, officials said.
The Pan-Arab TV channel Al-Mayadeen, which is politically allied with the Lebanese Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, identified the journalists killed in the town of Tair Harfa as correspondent Farah Omar and cameraman Rabih Maamari. It said they were ""martyred by treacherous Israeli targeting.""
The airstrike that hit the journalists also killed a Lebanese civilian, Hussein Akil, according to Al-Mayadeen and Lebanon's state media.
The Israeli military said its soldiers took action against an alleged threat posed by a weapon launching area in southern Lebanon. It said the attack was under review.
""We are aware of a claim regarding journalists in the area who were killed as a result,"" the military said. ""This is an area with active hostilities, where exchanges of fire occur. Presence in the area is dangerous.""
The deaths bring the number of journalists who have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war began last month to at least 50, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Most were Palestinian journalists working in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli shelling in southern Lebanon on Oct. 14 killed Reuters videojournalist Issam Abduallah and wounded other journalists from France's international news agency, Agence France-Presse, and Qatar's Al-Jazeera TV.
The first month of the Israel-Gaza war is now the deadliest month for journalists since the Committee to Protect Journalists began documenting journalist fatalities in 1992.
Elsewhere in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, an Israeli drone strike in the village of Chaatiyeh near the Mediterranean coast killed four members of Hamas, the Palestinian official and Lebanese security official said.
The Palestinian official identified the four as members of the Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing. The Lebanese security official also confirmed that they were members of Hamas but did not say if they were from the group's military wing.
Another Lebanese security official said the dead included Khalil Kharraz, the deputy chief of Qassam Brigades in Lebanon. Lebanese authorities briefly detained Kharraz in 2014 after he was blamed for firing rockets into Israel from Lebanon.
A Hamas official in Lebanon said there were ""a number of martyrs from the Palestinian resistance,"" without confirming the number or identities. All three officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal military information.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the reported drone strike.
The Lebanon-Israel border has seen daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops. The clashes began a day after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel and have raised concerns that Hezbollah will join the Hamas-Israel war.
Hezbollah's media office vowed in a statement that the killing of the journalists ""will not pass without retaliation.""
Hours later, Hezbollah said in a statement that it struck an Israeli intelligence unit inside a home in northern Israel with two missiles in retaliation for the killing of journalists and civilians on the Lebanese side of the border. It said the people inside the home located near Kibbutz Manara were killed or wounded.
Hamas has a significant presence in Lebanon, which is home to tens of thousands of Palestinians, many of whom live in the country's 12 refugee camps. On Oct. 14, Hamas said three of its fighters were killed along the border and their bodies held by Israel.
The deaths of the Al-Mayadeen journalists Tuesday spurred a widespread outcry in Lebanon.
""It was direct targeting. It was not a coincidence,"" Al-Mayadeen director Ghassan bin Jiddo said while holding back tears during a live broadcast. They join ""the martyrs of Gaza,"" he said.
Last week, the Israeli government blocked the Al-Mayadeen channel from broadcasting in Israel.
Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the strike, saying that ""this aggression proves again that there are no limits to Israel's crimes whose main goal is to silence the media that is revealing its crimes.""
""Treacherous Israel is targeting media crews in south Lebanon,"" Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary said, describing the strike as ""outrageous.""
Hamas also condemned the attack, calling it in a statement ""a continuation of the savage war on our Palestinian people and our Arab and Muslim nation.""
In her last live report shortly before her death, Omar cited a Hezbollah statement issued Tuesday morning claiming a strike on a house in the northern Israeli city of Metula, where Israeli soldiers were stationed. Hezbollah said the attack was in retaliation for Israel targeting civilian homes in south Lebanon.
""We are still in the early hours of the day, and we are following any developments that might happen,"" the correspondent said, speaking some of the last words.
Local media reported several other Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon on Tuesday.
State-run National News Agency said Israel's military struck the outskirts of the villages of Teir Harfa and Majdal Zoun. It also reported that another strike on a home in the border village of Kfar Kila killed a woman and wounded her granddaughter.

Hamas Launches Surprise Attack as Gunmen Enter Israel

The Palestinian movement Hamas launched the biggest attack on Israel in years on Saturday in a surprise assault that combined gunmen crossing the border with a heavy barrage of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip.
As warning sirens sounded across southern and central Israel, including in Jerusalem, Israel's military said it was on a war footing as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called an emergency meeting of security officials.
Saturday's incident marked an unprecedented infiltration by Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and was the most serious escalation since Israel and Hamas fought a 10-day war in 2021.
Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of conflict ahead.
Hamas military commander Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.
""This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,"" he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.
One Israeli woman was killed, according to emergency services, as ambulance crews were deployed in areas around the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.
""A number of terrorists have infiltrated into Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip,"" the military said in a statement, adding that residents in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip had been told to stay in their homes.
Israeli media reported that gunmen had opened fire on passers-by in the town of Sderot, in southern Israel, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show clashes in city streets as well as gunmen in jeeps roaming the countryside.
""We were told there are terrorists inside the kibbutz, we can hear gunfire,"" a young woman named Dvir, from Beeri Kibbutz, told Israeli Army Radio from her bomb shelter.
Reports of Israelis taken captive
Palestinian media also reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.
The Israeli military was aware of reports of captives, a security source said, but provided no further details.
Netanyahu's office said he would meet top security officials in the coming hours and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant authorized the call-up of reservists.
In Gaza the roar of rocket launches could be heard and residents reported armed clashes along the separation fence with Israel, near the southern town of Khan Younis, and said they had seen significant movement of armed fighters.
Israel's ambulance service said teams had been dispatched to areas in southern Israel near Gaza and residents were warned to stay inside.
A group representing military reservists who had planned to refuse to attend training over their objections to the government's plans to overhaul the judiciary called on reservists to report for duty.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.
""We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,"" said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.
Palestinians in Gaza expressed disbelief at the infiltration into Israel. ""It is like a dream. I still can't believe it, fighters inside our occupied land?"" said one Gaza shopkeeper.
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat it a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

Seven Palestinians were killed and 13 others were injured by Israeli forces in a raid on Jenin city and refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry said on Thursday.
Israel's military said it was conducting ""counter-terrorism"" raids in Jenin, but gave no further details.
The number of Palestinians killed in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip passed 10,500, including more than 4,300 children, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said.
In the West Bank, more than 160 Palestinians have been killed in the violence and Israeli raids.
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said on Thursday that he was concerned about the spillover risk of the situation in Gaza, adding that the West Bank ""is boiling.""

Netanyahu Says Israel Will Have an 'Overall Security' Role in Gaza Indefinitely

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will have ""overall security responsibility"" in Gaza for an indefinite period after its war with Hamas, the clearest indication yet that Israel plans to maintain control over the coastal enclave that is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.
In an interview with ABC News that aired late Monday, Netanyahu expressed openness to ""little pauses"" in the fighting to facilitate the release of some of the more than 240 captives seized by Hamas in its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, which triggered the war exactly one month ago.
But he ruled out any general ceasefire without the release of all the hostages, and the White House said there was no agreement with United States President Joe Biden's call for a broader humanitarian pause after a phone call between the leaders on Monday.
Israeli troops have been battling Palestinian militants inside Gaza for over a week, and have succeeded in cutting the territory in half and encircling Gaza City.
The war has come at a staggering cost. Airstrikes have leveled entire city blocks across the territory, and around 70% of the population has fled their homes, with many heeding Israeli orders to head to the southern part of the besieged territory, which is also being bombed. Food, medicine, fuel and water are running low, and United Nations-run schools-turned-shelters are overflowing.
The Palestinian death toll has surpassed 10,000, the Health Ministry of the Hamas-run Gaza Strip said Monday, including over 4,100 children. More than 2,300 people are missing and believed to be buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the ministry said. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, and Israel says it has killed thousands of fighters.
About 1,400 people in Israel have died, mostly civilians killed in the Oct. 7 incursion by Hamas that started the war. Israel has vowed to remove Hamas from power and crush its military capabilities.
Israel is focused on Gaza City, which before the war was home to some 650,000 people - about equal to the population of Washington, D.C. Israel says Hamas has extensive militant infrastructure in the city, including a vast tunnel network, and accuses it of using civilians as human shields.
Several hundred thousand people are believed to remain in the north in the assault's path. The military says a one-way corridor for residents of Gaza City and surrounding areas to flee south remains available. But many are afraid to use the route, part of which is held by Israeli troops.
Residents in northern Gaza reported heavy battles overnight into Tuesday morning in the outskirts of Gaza City. The Shati refugee camp, a built-up district housing refugees from the 1948 war and their descendants, has been heavily bombarded from the air and sea over the past two days, residents said.
Marwan Abdullah, who is among thousands of people sheltering at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital, said they heard constant explosions overnight as ambulances brought dead and wounded in from the Shati camp. ""We couldn't sleep. Things get worse day by day,"" he said.
A strike early Monday hit the roof of Shifa Hospital, killing a number of displaced people sheltering on its top floor and destroying solar panels, said Mohamed Zaqout, general manager of all hospitals in Gaza. The panels have been helping keep power on in the facility, which has been reduced to using one generator because of lack of fuel.
In southern Gaza, where Palestinians have been told to seek refuge, an Israeli airstrike destroyed several homes early Tuesday in the town of Khan Younis. First responders pulled five bodies - including three dead children - from the rubble, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene.
The war has also stoked wider tensions, with Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group trading fire along the border. More than 160 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since the war began, mainly during violent protests and gunbattles with Israeli forces during arrest raids.
Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital. It has built settlements across the occupied West Bank that are now home to over 500,000 Jewish settlers.
Israeli officials have said little about their plans for a post-Hamas Gaza, while indicating they don't want to reoccupy the territory. Israel withdrew its troops and more than 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintained control over the territory's airspace, coastline, population registry and all but one of its border crossings.
Hamas seized power from forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas two years later, confining his Palestinian Authority to parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Since then, Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza to varying degrees. Israel says the blockade is needed to keep Hamas from rearming, while the Palestinians and rights groups see it as a form of collective punishment.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who wrapped up a dayslong trip to the region on Monday, has suggested a revitalized Palestinian Authority could govern Gaza. But Abbas has said it would only do so as part of a solution to the conflict that establishes a Palestinian state on the 1967 lines. Israel's government is strongly opposed to Palestinian statehood.
Netanyahu told ABC News that Gaza should be governed by ""those who don't want to continue the way of Hamas,"" without elaborating.
""I think Israel will, for an indefinite period, will have the overall security responsibility, because we've seen what happens when we don't have it. When we don't have that security responsibility, what we have is the eruption of Hamas terror on a scale that we couldn't imagine,"" he said.
The military says 30 Israeli troops have been killed since the ground offensive began over a week ago. Hamas and other militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, disrupting daily life even as most are intercepted or fall in open areas. Tens of thousands of Israelis have evacuated from communities near the volatile borders with Gaza and Lebanon.
Hundreds of trucks carrying aid have been allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt since Oct. 21. But humanitarian workers say the aid is far short of mounting needs. Egypt's Rafah crossing has also opened to allow hundreds of foreign passport holders and medical patients to leave Gaza.

Strikes at Hospitals in Gaza Trigger Exodus of Thousands Sheltering There

Thousands of Palestinians sheltering from the Israel-Hamas war at Gaza City's main hospital fled south Friday after several reported strikes in and around the compound overnight. They joined a growing exodus of people escaping intense urban fighting in the north -- including near other hospitals -- as Gaza officials said the territory's death toll surpassed 11,000.
The search for safety across the besieged Gaza Strip has grown desperate as Israel intensified its assault on the territory's largest city. The Israel army says Hamas' military infrastructure is nestled amid Gaza City's hospitals and neighborhoods. Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas after its deadly Oct. 7 surprise incursion.
The tens of thousands of Palestinians who fled south in the past few days face the prospect of ongoing bombardment and dire conditions. Reported overnight strikes on or near at least four hospitals in northern Gaza underscored the danger for tens of thousands more who have crowded into the facilities, believing they will be safe.
BATTLES AROUND HOSPITALS Early Friday, strikes hit the courtyard and the obstetrics department of al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest, where tens of thousands of people are sheltering, according to Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesperson at the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
A video of the courtyard recorded the sound of incoming fire waking people in makeshift shelters, followed by shouts for an ambulance. In the blood-splattered courtyard, one man writhed screaming on the ground, his leg apparently severed.
Al-Qidra blamed the attack on Israel, a claim that could not be independently verified.
The Israeli army says Hamas hides in and under hospitals and that it has set up its main command center in and under al-Shifa - claims the militant group and hospital staff deny.
For weeks, tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians - reaching as many 60,000 this week, according to the Health Ministry - have been sheltering in the al-Shifa hospital complex, hoping it would be safe.
But the overnight strikes triggered a mass exodus of the displaced. At around 10 a.m., large numbers packed up their belongings and began streaming out, walking toward the south, five people who were among those who left told the AP.
It was not clear how many remained at al-Shifa, but they said the vast majority had left. Wafaa abu Hajajj, a journalist who had been sheltering at al-Shifa hospital and arrived Friday in the south, said mainly those who could not walk or did not know where to go remained.
""The strikes were hoping to scare people and it worked. It was too intense and it became too much,"" said 32-year-old Haneen Abu Awda, who had been at al-Shifa being treated for wounds from an earlier strike on their house.
At the same time, al-Shifa has been overwhelmed by thousands of wounded, even as it operates with minimal power and medical supplies.
In video released Friday by the Gaza Health Ministry, bodies of limp children are seen laid on stretchers across blood-stained floors in the hospital, some dead, some barely breathing. Other patients were strewn around the floor, unable to be treated for lack of supplies. One man is seen gasping for air.
The director of al-Shifa said Israel demanded the facility be evacuated, but he said there was nowhere for such a large number of patients to go.
""Where are we going to evacuate them?"" Director Mohammed Abu Selmia asked speaking to Al Jazeera television.
In all, Gaza health officials said strikes were carried out near four hospitals overnight and early Friday, all of which were packed with displaced people and patients.
The Health Ministry said one person had been killed at al-Shifa and several were wounded. A senior Israeli security official said initial findings indicated that one strike at al-Shifa was the result of a misfire by militants. The military is conducting a review. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.
Another strike near the Al-Nasr Medical Center killed two people, according to the ministry. The strike forced the shutdown of Nasr's children's hospital, the only remaining specialized pediatric care in north Gaza, said World Health Organization spokesperson Margaret Harris.
She said it was not known what happened to patients there, including children receiving dialysis and on life support - ""things that you cannot possibly evacuate them safely with.""
Al-Qidra, the health ministry spokesman, said ambulances could not reach Nasr hospital to evacuate patients because of Israeli strikes.
CIVILIANS FLEE SOUTH Tens of thousands of new evacuees from the north, some coming from al-Shifa, flowed down Salah al-Din road - the central spine running the length of the Gaza Strip - and reached the central city of Deir al-Balah on Friday. With no fuel for vehicles, the crowds had walked for hours as explosions echoed a short distance away. Among them were wounded and older people.
They arrived hungry, exhausted and with a stew of emotions - relief, rage, and despair.
Reem Asant, 50, described winding through the streets on the way out of Gaza City, trying to avoid shelling.
""We're talking about children killed in a hospital,"" shouted one man, Abu Yousef, his voice rising with fury. ""Hundreds of women killed every day. Houses collapsing on the heads of civilians ... Where are human rights? Where is the United Nations? Where is the United States? Where is the International Criminal Court? Where is the entire world?""
The Israeli military announced an expanded six-hour window Friday for civilians to escape northern Gaza along Salah al-Din, the route used since last weekend. It also announced the opening of a second route, along the coastal road, after an agreement announced by the White House a day earlier.
The White House said Israel agreed to implement a brief humanitarian pause each day - in what appeared to be an effort to formalize and expand the process.
More than two-thirds of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have fled their homes since the war began. Israel estimates that more than 850,000 of the 1.1 people in northern Gaza have left, according to military spokesman Jonathan Conricus. He called the pauses ""quick humanitarian windows"" that allow southward movement ""while we are fighting.""
UN expert for the Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese called the pauses ""cynical and cruel,"" saying it was just enough ""to let people breathe and remember what is the sound of life without bombing, before starting bombing them again.""
RISING DEATH TOLLS More than 11,070 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed since the war began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Another 2,650 people have been reported missing.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday that ""far too many"" Palestinians have died and suffered and that while recent Israeli steps to try to minimize civilian harm are positive, they are not enough.
US Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf told American lawmakers this week that it was ""very possible"" the death toll was even higher than the Gaza Health Ministry has reported, despite suggestions by President Joe Biden and others that it was exaggerated.
More than 1,400 people have been killed in Israel, mainly in the initial Hamas attack, and 41 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ground offensive began.
Palestinian militants have continued to fire rockets into Israel, and an attack on Tel Aviv wounded at least two people Friday, said Yossi Elkabetz, a paramedic with Israel's rescue services. Hamas claimed credit.
Some 250,000 Israelis have been forced to evacuate from communities near Gaza and along the northern border with Lebanon, where Israeli forces and Hezbollah militants have traded fire repeatedly.

Israel 'at War' as Hamas Gunmen Launch Surprise Attack from Gaza,"

Israel 'at War' as Hamas Gunmen Launch Surprise Attack from Gaza

The Palestinian Hamas movement launched the biggest attack on Israel in years on Saturday, killing more than 20 people in a surprise assault that combined gunmen penetrating into Israeli towns with a barrage of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip.
Israel said the Iran-backed group had declared war as its army confirmed fighting with militants in several Israeli towns and military bases near Gaza and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate.
""Our enemy will pay a price the type of which it has never known,"" he said. ""We are in a war and we will win it.""
At least 22 Israelis were killed in the attack so far with more than 250 wounded, Israel's ambulance service said, but added that the toll was expected to rise.
The Israeli military said it had launched air strikes into Gaza, where witnesses reported hearing heavy explosions, with at least two dead.
The attack marked an unprecedented infiltration by an unknown number of Hamas gunmen into Israel from Gaza, and one of the most serious escalations in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in years.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian people have the right to defend themselves against the ""terror of settlers and occupation troops"", the official news agency WAFA quoted him as saying.
He spoke at an emergency meeting held in Ramallah with a number of top officials from the Palestinian Authority.
Israeli broadcaster Reshet 13 TV News said militants were holding Israelis hostage in the town of Ofakim, and that five Palestinian gunmen had been killed in the town of Sderot and homes had been set on fire.
Israeli media reported gunbattles between bands of Palestinian fighters and security forces in towns in southern Israel. Israel's police chief said there were ""21 active scenes"" in southern Israel, indicating the extent of the attack.
In Gaza, people rushed to buy supplies in anticipation of days of conflict ahead. Some evacuated their homes and headed for shelters.
Hamas military commander Mohammad Deif announced the start of the operation in a broadcast on Hamas media, calling on Palestinians everywhere to fight.
""This is the day of the greatest battle to end the last occupation on earth,"" he said, adding that 5,000 rockets had been launched.
The last major flare-up between Israel and Hamas was a 10-day war in 2021.
'Please send help'
Speaking to Israel N12 News by phone from Nir Oz, a kibbutz near Gaza, a woman identified as Dorin said fighters had infiltrated her house and tried to open the bomb shelter where she was hiding.
""They just came in again, please send help,"" she said. ""There are a lot of homes harmed ... My husband is holding the door closed ... They are firing rounds of bullets.""
Israeli Defense Minister Gallant said ""troops are fighting against the enemy at every location"" and authorized the call-up of reservists.
The Israeli military said its forces were operating inside Gaza but gave no details.
Israeli media reported that gunmen had opened fire on passers-by in Sderot, and footage circulating on social media appeared to show clashes in city streets as well as gunmen in jeeps roaming the countryside.
""We were told there are terrorists inside the kibbutz, we can hear gunfire,"" a young woman named Dvir, from Beeri Kibbutz, told Israeli Army Radio from her bomb shelter.
The escalation comes against a backdrop of surging violence between Israel and Palestinian gunmen in the West Bank, which together with the Gaza Strip is part of the territories where Palestinians have long sought to establish a state.
It also comes at a time of political upheaval in Israel, which has been riven by deep divisions over moves to overhaul the judiciary.
Reports of Israelis taken captive
Hamas media displayed videos of what it said were bodies of Israeli soldiers brought into Gaza by fighters, and Palestinian gunmen inside Israeli homes and touring an Israeli town in jeeps reportedly been driven into Israel by the attackers.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage.
Palestinian media also reported that a number of Israelis had been taken captive by fighters and Hamas media circulated video footage apparently showing a destroyed Israeli tank.
The Israeli military was aware of reports of captives, a security source said, but provided no further details. In a briefing with reporters, an Israeli military spokesman declined to comment.
In Gaza, the roar of rocket launches could be heard and residents reported armed clashes along the separation fence with Israel, near the southern town of Khan Younis, and said they had seen significant movement of armed fighters.
Israel's ambulance service said teams had been dispatched to areas in southern Israel near Gaza and residents were warned to stay inside.
The Palestinian Islamic Jihad group said its fighters were joining Hamas in the attack.
""We are part of this battle, our fighters are side-by-side with their brothers in the Qassam Brigades until victory is achieved,"" said Islamic Jihad armed wing spokesman Abu Hamza on a post on Telegram.
Palestinians in Gaza expressed disbelief at the infiltration into Israel. ""It is like a dream. I still can't believe it,"" said one Gaza shopkeeper.
The attack came a day after Israel marked the 50th anniversary of the 1973 war that brought the country to the verge of catastrophic defeat in a surprise attack by Syria and Egypt.

What is Hamas? The Group that Rules the Gaza Strip Has Fought Several Rounds of War with Israel

Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, launched an attack inside Israel over the weekend, killing hundreds and taking others hostage. Its unprecedented breach of the border sent fighters inside border communities and military installations, shocked Israel and its allies, and raised questions about the group's capabilities and strategy.
WHAT IS HAMAS? The group was founded in 1987 by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a Palestinian refugee living in Gaza, during the first intifada, or uprising, which was marked by widespread protests against Israel's occupation.
Hamas is the Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, and a recognition of the group's roots and early ties to one of the Sunni world's most prominent groups, the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in the 1920s.
The group has vowed to annihilate Israel and has been responsible for many suicide bombings and other deadly attacks on civilians and Israeli soldiers.
The US State Department has designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. The European Union and other Western countries also consider it a terrorist organization.
Hamas won 2006 parliamentary elections elections and in 2007 violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, dominated by rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israel responded to the Hamas takeover with a blockade on Gaza, restricting movement of people and goods in and out of the territory in a step it says is needed to keep the group from developing weapons. The blockade has ravaged Gaza's economy, and Palestinians accuse Israel of collective punishment.
Hamas received backing from Arab countries. Recently, it's moved closer to Iran and its allies.
WHO ARE HAMAS' LEADERS? Hamas founder and spiritual leader Yassin - a paralyzed man who used a wheelchair - spent years in Israeli prisons and oversaw the establishment of Hamas' military wing, which carried out its first suicide attack in 1993.
Israeli forces have targeted Hamas leaders throughout the years, killing Yassin in 2004.
Khaled Mashaal, an exiled Hamas member who survived an earlier Israeli assassination attempt, became the group's leader soon after.
Yehia Sinwar, in Gaza, and Ismail Haniyeh, who lives in exile, are Hamas' current leaders. They realigned the group's leadership with Iran and its allies, including Lebanon's Hezbollah. Since then, many of the group's leaders relocated to Beirut.
WHAT DOES HAMAS WANT? Hamas has always espoused violence as a means to liberate occupied Palestinian territories and has called for the annihilation of Israel.
Hamas has carried out suicide bombings and over the years fired tens of thousands of increasingly powerful rockets from Gaza into Israel. It also established a network of tunnels running from Gaza to Egypt to smuggle in weapons, as well as attack tunnels burrowing into Israel.
In recent years, Hamas had appeared to be more focused on running Gaza than attacking Israel.
WHY NOW? In recent years, Israel has made peace deals with Arab countries without having to make concessions in its conflict with the Palestinians. Meanwhile, Israel's new far-right government was working to cement Israeli settlements in the West Bank despite Palestinian opposition.
Hamas leaders say an Israeli crackdown on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements - which the international community considers to be illegal - thousands of prisoners in Israeli jails, and its ongoing blockade of Gaza pushed it to attack.
Its leaders say hundreds of its 40,000 fighters took part in the assault. Israel says the group has about 30,000 fighters and an arsenal of rockets, including some with a range of about 250 kilometers (155 miles), and unmanned drones.

Israel Ramps up Strikes on Gaza as US Advises Delaying Ground Offensive to Allow Talks on Captives,"

Israel Ramps up Strikes on Gaza as US Advises Delaying Ground Offensive to Allow Talks on Captives

Israel ramped up its airstrikes Monday in Gaza, where the death toll was rising rapidly, and the United States advised Israel to delay an expected ground invasion to allow more time to negotiate the release of hostages taken by Hamas militants.
A third small aid convoy from Egypt entered Gaza, where the population of 2.3 million has been running out of food, water and medicine under Israel's two-week seal. Israel was still barring the entry of fuel, and Gaza hospitals say they are struggling to keep generators running to power life-saving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies.
Heavy airstrikes demolished buildings across Gaza, including in areas where Palestinians have been told to seek refuge, killing hundreds and sending new waves of wounded into already packed hospitals, according to Palestinian officials and witnesses.
After a strike in Gaza City, a woman with blood on her face wept as she clasped the hand of a dead relative. At least three bodies were sprawled on the street, one lying in a gray stream of water.
Israel is widely expected to launch a ground offensive in Gaza following Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities. That is raising fears of the war spreading beyond Gaza and Israel, as Iranian-backed fighters in the region are warning of possible escalation, including targeting US forces deployed in the Mideast.
The US has urged Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups not to join the fight. Israel has frequently traded fire with Hezbollah, which is armed with tens of thousands of rockets. Israeli warplanes have struck targets in the occupied West Bank, Syria and Lebanon in recent days.
The US has advised Israeli officials that delaying the expected ground offensive would give Washington more time to work with regional mediators on securing the release of people captured by Hamas during its deadly incursion, according to a US official.
The official, who requested anonymity to discuss the private discussions, said it was unclear how much the argument will ""move the needle"" on Israeli thinking. Hamas released an American woman and her teenage daughter last week in what it said was a humanitarian gesture mediated by Qatar.
Tanks and troops have been massed at the Gaza border, and Israel says it has stepped up airstrikes in order to reduce the risk to troops in the next stages. A ground excursion is likely to dramatically increase casualties in what is already the deadliest by far of five wars fought between Israel and Hamas in less than 15 years.
More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack. At least 222 people were captured and dragged back to Gaza, including foreigners, the military said Monday, updating a previous figure.
More than 5,000 Palestinians, including some 2,000 minors and around 1,100 women, have been killed, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said Monday. That includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. The toll has climbed rapidly in recent days, with the ministry reporting 436 additional deaths in just the last 24 hours.
Israel said it had struck 320 militant targets throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours in preparation for ""a maneuver,"" an apparent reference to a ground operation. The military says it does not target civilians, and that Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets at Israel since the start of the war.
The Israeli military released footage showing what it said were attacks on Hamas infrastructure. Flashes of yellow light were followed by an explosion that sent gray smoke and debris shooting upward as multi-story buildings collapsed or toppled over.
Israel carried out limited ground forays into Gaza, and on Sunday, Hamas said it had destroyed an Israeli tank and two armored bulldozers inside the territory it has ruled since 2007. The Israeli military said a soldier was killed and three others were wounded by an anti-tank missile during a raid inside Gaza.
The military said the raid was part of efforts to rescue hostages abducted in the Oct. 7 attack. Hamas hopes to trade the captives for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
On Monday the Palestinian Red Crescent said 20 trucks entered Gaza carrying food, water, medicine and medical supplies, through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the only way into Gaza not controlled by Israel. It was the third delivery in as many days, each around the same size.
An airstrike hit a residential building some 200 meters (yards) from the UN headquarters in Rafah on Monday, killing and wounding several people, according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene, underscoring the perils of humanitarian operations.
Abu Youssef Al-Najjar Hospital, in Rafah, registered 61 deaths since Monday morning, the hospital's spokesperson said, following a day of intense airstrikes in southern Gaza. With no room in the morgue for the bodies, ""more than half of them are lying on the (hospital) ground,"" spokesperson Talaat Barghout said.
In a Sunday phone call, Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden ""affirmed that there will now be continued flow of this critical assistance into Gaza,"" the White House said in a statement.
Relief workers said far more aid was needed to address the spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Much of the population is drinking dirty water; the lack of fuel has crippled water and sanitation systems. The UN humanitarian agency said 20 trucks amounts to 4% of an average day's imports before the war.
More than half the territory's population have fled their homes, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in UN-run schools and tent camps.
The World Health Organization said seven hospitals in northern Gaza have been forced to shut down due to damage from strikes, lack of power and supplies, or Israeli evacuation orders.
Israel repeated its calls for people to leave northern Gaza, including by dropping leaflets from the air. It estimated 700,000 have already fled. But hundreds of thousands remain. That would raise the risk of mass civilian casualties in any ground offensive.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israel ""can't go back to the status quo"" in which Hamas controls Gaza and is able to threaten it, but that Israel has ""absolutely no intent"" to govern Gaza itself.
Speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, he said the question of how Gaza will be governed needs to be worked out ""even as Israel is dealing with the current threat.""
Israel captured Gaza, along with the West Bank and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state. Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but Israel has imposed a blockade of varying degrees since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.

Israel has confirmed that 212 people are being held hostage in Gaza, the military spokesperson said on Sunday, adding that Israeli strikes overnight killed dozens of Palestinian fighters, including the deputy chief of Hamas rocket forces.
Israel began unrelenting airstrikes on Gaza to its southwest after Hamas gunmen breached the border on Oct. 7 and carried out a shock rampage through nearby communities, killing 1,400 people, mainly civilians, and taking the hostages back to Gaza.
Concerns about the risk of wider Middle East conflict triggered by the Israel-Hamas war rose on Sunday with the US dispatching more military assets to the region as Israel pummeled targets in Gaza and Hamas supporters in Lebanon and Syria.
On the northern front, Israel has been attacking fighters trying to fire missiles across the Lebanese border and struck a site in Lebanon from where a missile was fired at an Israeli aircraft, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a briefing.

Two Weeks Ago She Was Thriving. Now, a Middle-Class Mom in Gaza Struggles to Survive

Yousra Abu Sharekh's days begin in the southern Gaza Strip often after sleepless nights amid blaring ambulance sirens and the clamor of neighbors in the brief pause between relentless Israeli airstrikes.
By daybreak, the 33-year-old mother is on the hunt for bread, lining up for hours at bakeries to buy one bag to feed her two children. Without electricity, disconnected from her relatives and terrified by the sounds of warplanes overhead, she rushes in the afternoon to see her sick mother at a crowded UN shelter 20 minutes away.
There, she finally can charge her phone and check on her 66-year-old father who stubbornly stayed behind in their northern Gaza City home, refusing to heed Israeli evacuation orders.
Only two weeks ago, Abu Sharekh had a thriving life, working enthusiastically at a coveted new job and caring for her family.
""I feel either we were dreaming then or we are in a nightmare now,"" she said. ""Everyone was making plans, enjoying their lives the best they could. Suddenly we are wandering the streets without fuel to drive our cars, electricity, water or food. Homes are lost, people are being killed.""
It's a view shared by many among Gaza's tiny, but budding middle class for whom hard-won progress despite Israel's 16-year blockade and the slow erosion of Gaza's state institutions was reversed in a matter of days. After Israel declared war following Hamas' violent rampage across the border fence, their dreams of good jobs, attending foreign universities and buying homes were dashed.
Now when thinking about the future, many draw a blank, unable to imagine an existence beyond the daily fear of being killed in an airstrike. They include graphic designers seeking shelter in tents outside overcrowded UN facilities, architects living among dozens of other relatives and UN workers grappling with the destruction of their houses.
Before the war, an aspirational middle class had emerged from the rubble of earlier conflicts in Gaza. Despite the enduring blockade and severe limits on travel, they were able to invest in their children's education, local businesses, even private beach-side bungalows and fancy eateries. Against the rising current of unemployment and precarious economic conditions, a small portion of society in Gaza managed to prosper.
Abu Sharekh graduated this summer with an engineering degree from Portland State University, in Oregon, as a Fulbright scholar. She returned home ecstatic to have landed a job with al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City and to be reunited with her family.
Within the span of a week starting Oct. 7, those hopes vanished as if crushed under the rubble of the flattened homes in her Gaza City neighborhood. Survival grew precarious. Her workplace became the scene of a horrific explosion.
Sharing a home with 70 other displaced relatives in a home in Khan Younis, Abu Sharekh said the day starts with anxiety about how to get bread to feed the many children there. Abu Sharekh's two sons, ages 5 and 10, survive on canned beans. Water is rationed, just 300 milliliters (10 fluid ounces) per person every day. At night, their quarters are plunged into darkness.
Still, Abu Sharekh says it's better than the overcrowded and dirty UN shelter at the Khan Younis Training Center, where her mother stays.
The shelter, housing nearly 11 times its designated capacity with nearly 20,000 people, is the most overcrowded among the 91 UNRWA installations where nearly half a million Gaza residents have sought refuge. Tents have cropped up outside, triggering painful memories of the mass displacement of the 1948 war with Israel, which Palestinians call the Nakba, or catastrophe.
""It's undignified,"" Abu Sharekh says.
Men and women stand in line to use the same toilet facility. The wait is so long that fights break out. Garbage is piled outside. There is no steady supply of food or water.
Her mother, a cancer survivor, suffers from gastrointestinal issues and needs a toilet for two to three hours a day. That has been impossible in the shelter.
""It was heartbreaking, I was inside the shelter's administration building, she was outside, and I was begging the man at the door just to let her in to use the toilet,"" she said. ""I couldn't do anything for her to get in, I was so helpless, can you imagine?""
But her 63-year-old mother didn't feel safe anywhere else, despite warnings from relatives that even UN shelters were not impervious to Israeli bombardment.
The UN reported nearly 180 internally displaced Palestinians at their facilities have been injured and 12 killed since the start of the war.
Abu Sharekh's father, traumatized by tales of his parents' displacement from their village in what is now the Israeli city of Ashkelon in 1948, was adamant history would not repeat itself, she said. ""That was the main point for him,"" she said.
He described an increasingly desperate situation in their Gaza City neighborhood: People breaking into homes looking for food and wandering the streets in search of supplies.
She fears he won't pick up when she calls. Or that scrolling through social media, she will find her home among the several destroyed nearly every day. A strike damaged the home she shares with her husband and leveled the building her brother lived in.
""All my furniture, all my memories, windows, doors, everything is broken,"" she said.
She didn't want to leave, either. But her husband persuaded her, telling her at least the children should be spared the horror of airstrikes, and that they should stay together.
""But as we discovered, there are airstrikes everywhere.""

For the first time since the conflict in Gaza began earlier this month, Israel has officially accused Iran of being directly responsible for the attack by Hamas, which triggered the outbreak of the war. Tel Aviv is claiming that Tehran was involved in both training and planning.
The Israeli government has launched an international campaign against both Hamas and Iran, considering them responsible for the Oct. 7 attack, which they believe was part of a plan for a ""regional war that threatens global peace.""
The Israeli Foreign Ministry gathered 100 foreign media correspondents for a meeting on Monday, during which it presented a video showing acts of cruelty and staged scenes involving bodies during the Hamas attack on Israeli towns near Gaza.
Spokespersons at the meeting stated that Iran trained Hamas operatives and devised the attack plan for them as part of a ""broad regional battle"" against Israel, involving all of its militias across the Middle East, from Yemen to Iraq, as well as from Lebanon and Syria.
Veteran Israeli diplomat Itamar Rabinovich regards the current Gaza conflict as the ""first Iran-Israel war.""
Rabinovich, who previously served as the Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and as Israel's ambassador to Washington, and who chaired the Israeli delegation for negotiations with Syria, affirmed that the conflict being witnessed since Oct. 7 is a war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
""However, this war is taking place within a broader context primarily shaped by Iranian efforts to challenge Israel on multiple fronts,"" noted Rabinovich.
He explained that ""currently, there is an ongoing war of attrition between Hezbollah, an Iranian proxy, and Israel, and at any given moment, Iran and the leadership of Hezbollah could determine the shift towards a full-scale war.""

Palestinians Call for Evacuating Gaza's Largest Hospital as Israel and Hamas Battle Just Outside,"

Palestinians Call for Evacuating Gaza's Largest Hospital as Israel and Hamas Battle Just Outside

Palestinian authorities on Tuesday called for a ceasefire to evacuate three dozen newborns and other patients trapped inside Gaza's biggest hospital as Israeli forces battle Hamas in the streets just outside and seize more ground across northern Gaza.
For days, the Israeli army has encircled Shifa Hospital, determined to seize the facility it says Hamas hides in, and beneath, to use civilians as shields for its main command base. Hospital staff and Hamas deny the claim.
Meanwhile, hundreds of patients, staff and displaced people are trapped inside, with supplies dwindling and without electricity to run incubators and other life-saving equipment. With refrigeration out for days, staff on Tuesday were digging a mass grave in the yard for more than 120 bodies in the morgue, health officials said.
Six weeks into the war, the standoff at al-Shifa and other hospitals comes as Israeli forces control larger swaths of Gaza City and the surrounding northern part of the Gaza Strip, saying they are driving out and killing Hamas fighters.
Israel has vowed to crush Hamas rule in Gaza after the militants' Oct. 7 surprise attack into Israel in which they killed some 1,200 people and dragged roughly 240 hostages back to Gaza. But even as its troops control more of a devastated north Gaza, the Israeli government has acknowledged it doesn't know what it will do with the territory after Hamas' defeat.
The onslaught - one of the world's deadliest and most intense bombardments this century -- has been disastrous for Gaza's 2.3 million Palestinians.
More than 11,000 people, two-thirds of them women and minors, have been killed, according to the Health Ministry of the Hamas-run territory - which has been unable to update its figures since Friday, citing the difficulty of collecting information. About 2,700 people have been reported missing. The ministry's count does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths.
Almost the entire population of Gaza has squeezed into the southern two-thirds of the tiny territory, where conditions have been deteriorating even as bombardment there continues. About 200,000 fled the north in recent days amid the intensifying fighting, the UN humanitarian office said Tuesday. Tens of thousands are believed to remain in the north.
Hamas released a video late Monday showing one of the hostages, who identifies herself as 19-year-old Noa Marciano, before and after she was killed in what Hamas said was an Israeli strike. The military later declared her a fallen soldier, without identifying a cause of death.
She is the first hostage confirmed to have died in captivity. Four were released by Hamas and a fifth was rescued by Israeli forces.
PLIGHT OF HOSPITALS Fighting has raged for days around al-Shifa Hospital, a complex several city blocks across at the center of Gaza City that has now ""turned into a cemetery,"" its director said in a statement.
The Health Ministry said 40 patients, including three babies, have died since al-Shifa's emergency generator ran out of fuel Saturday. Another 36 babies are at risk of dying because there is no power for incubators, according to the ministry.
The Israeli military said it had started an effort to transfer incubators to al-Shifa. But they would be useless without electricity, said Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization. He said the only way to save the newborns was to move them out of Gaza.
""Another hospital under siege or under attack is not a viable solution. Nowhere is safe in Gaza right now,"" he told The Associated Press. He said an evacuation would require specialized equipment and a ceasefire along the route.
The Health Ministry has proposed evacuating the hospital with the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and transferring the patients to hospitals in Egypt, but has not received any response, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said.
While Israel says it is willing to allow staff and patients to evacuate, some Palestinians who have made it out say Israeli forces have fired at evacuees. UN and Palestinian health officials say it is too dangerous to move the most vulnerable patients without proper ambulances and equipment.
Israel says its claims of a Hamas command center in and beneath al-Shifa are based on intelligence but has not provided visual evidence to support them. Denying the claims, the Gaza Health Ministry says it has invited international organizations to investigate the facility.
On Monday, the military released footage of a children's hospital in Gaza City that its forces entered over the weekend, showing weapons it said it found inside, as well as rooms in the basement where it believes militants were holding hostages. The video showed what appeared to be a hastily installed toilet and ventilation system in the basement.
The Health Ministry rejected the allegations, saying the area had been turned into a shelter for displaced people.
BATTLE IN GAZA CITY Independent accounts of the fighting in Gaza City have been nearly impossible to gather, as communications to the north have largely collapsed.
Videos released by the Israeli military show troops moving through the city, firing into buildings. Bulldozers push down structures as tanks roll through streets surrounded by rubble and partially collapsed towers.
The videos portray a battle where troops are rooting out pockets of Hamas fighters and tearing down wherever they find them. The military says it is also gradually dismantling the group's tunnel network.
Israel says it has killed several thousand fighters, including important mid-level commanders, while 46 of its own soldiers have been killed in Gaza. The military says Hamas has lost control in the north, and in recent days Hamas rocket fire into Israel - constant throughout the war - has waned. Details of the Israeli account and the extent of Hamas losses, however, could not be independently confirmed.
One Israeli commander in Gaza, identified only as Lt. Col. Gilad, said in a video that his forces near al-Shifa Hospital had been seizing government buildings, schools and residential buildings where they found weapons and eliminated fighters. After each was cleared, ""the location was demolished,"" he said.
The army said it had captured Gaza's legislature building - about two blocks from al-Shifa - the Hamas police headquarters and a compound housing Hamas' military intelligence headquarters. The captured buildings carry high symbolic value, though it was unclear what their strategic value is. Hamas fighters are believed to be positioned in underground bunkers.
Israeli news sites showed pictures of soldiers holding up the Israeli flag and military flags in celebration inside some of the buildings.
DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH Israel has urged civilians in the north to flee south, but southern Gaza is not much safer. Israel carries out frequent airstrikes throughout Gaza, hitting what it says are militant targets but often killing women and children.
Some 1.5 million Palestinians, more than two thirds of Gaza's population, have fled their homes, and UN-run shelters in the south are severely overcrowded.
People stand in line for hours for scarce bread and brackish water. Trash is piling up, sewage is flooding the streets and taps run dry because there is no way to power water systems. Israel has barred fuel imports since the start of the war, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes.
At a tent camp outside a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah, people trudged through mud as they stretched plastic tarps over flimsy tents.
""All of these tents collapsed because of the rain,"" said Iqbal Abu Saud, who had fled Gaza City with 30 of her relatives. ""How many days will we have to deal with this?""
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, which is struggling to provide basic services to over 600,000 people sheltering in schools and other facilities in the south, said it may run out of fuel by Wednesday, forcing it to halt most aid operations. It said it could no longer import limited supplies of food and medicine through Egypt's Rafah crossing, Gaza's only link to the outside world.

US Moving Quickly to Boost Israel's Military

Within hours of the horrific attack by Hamas, the US began moving warships and aircraft to the region to be ready to provide Israel with whatever it needed to respond.
A second US carrier strike group departs from Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday. Scores of aircraft are heading to US military bases around the Middle East. Special operations forces are now assisting Israel's military in planning and intelligence. The first shipment of additional munitions has already arrived.
More is expected, soon. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will arrive in Israel Friday to meet with Israeli leaders to discuss what else the US can provide.
For now, the buildup reflects US concern that the deadly fighting between Hamas and Israel could escalate into a more dangerous regional conflict. So, the primary mission for those ships and warplanes is to establish a force presence that deters Hezbollah, Iran or others from taking advantage of the situation. But the forces the US sends are capable of more than that.
A look at what weapons and options the US military could provide:
WEAPONS AND SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES The US is providing some personnel and much-needed munitions to Israel. Austin announced that a small special operations cell was now assisting Israel with intelligence and planning, and providing advice and consultations to the Israeli Defense Forces on hostage recovery efforts. Those forces, however, have not been tasked with hostage rescue, which would put them on the ground fighting in the conflict. That's something the Biden administration has not approved and White House spokesman John Kirby has said the Israelis do not want.
The US is also getting US defense companies to expedite weapons orders by Israel that were already on the books. Chief among those are munitions for Israel's Iron Dome air defense system.
""We're surging additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors to replenish Iron Dome,"" President Joe Biden said Tuesday. ""We're going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens.""
Iron Dome's missiles target rockets that approach its cities. According to Raytheon, Israel has 10 such systems in place. Beginning with Saturday's attack, Hamas has fired more than 5,000 rockets at Israel, most of which the system has been able to intercept, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
Raytheon produces most of the missile components for Iron Dome in the US, and the Army has two systems in its stockpile.
The Iron Dome munitions the US provides to Israel will likely be above and beyond what Israel has ordered and will be part of ongoing military assistance packages. Those packages will also include small diameter bombs and JDAM kits - essentially a tail fin and navigation kit that turns a ""dumb"" bomb into a ""smart"" bomb and enables troops to guide the munition to a target, rather than simply dropping it.
NAVY SHIPS AND PLANES One of the most visible examples of the US response was the announcement just hours after the attacks that the Pentagon would redirect the Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group to sail toward Israel. The carrier had just completed an exercise with the Italian Navy when the ship with its crew of about 5,000 was ordered to quickly sail to the Eastern Mediterranean.
One week after the attacks, as Israel positioned for a major ground offensive into Gaza City, Austin announced a second carrier group would be sailing toward Israel, as he ordered the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to join the Ford in the Eastern Mediterranean. In a statement announcing the move, Austin said he was sending the Eisenhower too ""as part of our effort to deter hostile actions against Israel or any efforts toward widening this war following Hamas's attack on Israel.""
The carriers provide a host of options. They serve as primary command and control operations centers and can conduct information warfare. They can launch and recover E2-Hawkeye surveillance planes, recognizable by their 24-foot (7-meter) diameter disc-shaped radars. The planes provide early warnings on missile launches, conduct surveillance and manage the airspace, not only detecting enemy aircraft but also directing US movements.
They also serve as a floating airbase for F-18 fighter jets that can fly intercepts or strike targets. And the carriers can flex to provide significant capabilities for humanitarian work, including onboard hospitals with ICUs, emergency rooms, medics, surgeons and doctors. They also sail with helicopters that can be used to airlift critical supplies in or victims out.
The Eisenhower had already been scheduled to deploy to the Mediterranean on a regular rotation, and the Ford is near the end of its scheduled deployment. But the Biden administration for now has decided to have both carriers there.
AIR FORCE WARPLANES The Pentagon has also ordered additional warplanes to bolster A-10, F-15 and F-16 squadrons at bases throughout the Middle East. More are to be added if needed.
Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Tuesday at an Atlantic Council event that the service was directing units that were about to come home to remain in place along with their replacements.
The US Air Force already has significant airpower in the region to conduct manned and unmanned operations, most notably in Syria where an Air Force F-16 last week was ordered to shoot down a Turkish drone that was posing a threat to US ground forces.
Kendall also said Air Force C-17s have landed in and departed from Israel since the attacks. The transport planes were picking up US military personnel who were there for a military exercise that hadn't started yet when the attacks began, the Air Force said in a statement.
Neither the Air Force nor Central Command would comment on what additional missions US airpower might take on in response to the conflict.

Exchange of Fire Drives Women, Children Out of South Lebanon Border Towns

Bilal, a Lebanese engineer, decided to move his family from Lebanon's southern border town of Aita Shaab to Tyre on the second day of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The war is now in its third week. Tensions have risen along the Lebanon-Israel border, where Hezbollah members are exchanging fire with Israeli.
For now, those exchanges remain limited to a handful of border towns and Hezbollah and Israeli military positions on both sides.
Bilal commutes daily from the city of Tyre to his hometown to continue his work.
""I head out in the morning from Tyre to Aita and return in the evening,"" he told Asharq Al-Awsat.
He added that there is no room for fear as long as the course of the battle continues within the conflict zones.
However, at the same time, he states that he managed to safeguard his small family and his two newborn children from the sounds of the shells.
Like the circumstances of many, Bilal's situation mirrors that of numerous others.
Many have relocated their families to safer areas in Beirut, Sidon, and Tyre.
They return to their villages in the morning and leave in the evening to continue their work.
Residents of the border region say that Syrian workers are the only ones who have completely evacuated.
As for the inhabitants of the border villages, approximately 20% of them have returned.
Most of them leave the villages in the evening, but in the morning, they resume their work in agriculture, livestock farming, and other sectors.
Asharq Al-Awsat conducted visits to several border villages in southern Lebanon, and the situation does not appear normal.
In the village of Kafr Kila, overlooking the border, the town is nearly devoid of women and children, except for around 20 households whose residents either cannot leave due to their financial circumstances or their involvement in local jobs.
""However, the town's youth have not abandoned it, prepared for any emergency, and the situation has not reached a point of permanent departure yet,"" as per Mohammed, who is currently residing in Kafr Kila.
Not far away, a sense of confusion prevails in the town of Khiam.
After approximately 90% of its population fled to neighboring villages and Beirut over the past week, today, 20% of them are returning.
""The situation is expected to prolong, possibly for more than a month,"" said Abbas, who owns a local grocery store.
""We can't stay away from our homes given the economic reality outside Khiam. We've returned to work, even at a slower pace. Those who remained steadfast here, whether locals or others, deserve our support for what they're enduring,"" added Abbas.
""We have some of the necessary supplies like chicken and basic groceries that the residents of nearby towns lack since most of the large stores, groceries, and bakeries have closed there,"" he explained.
In Qlaiaa, the Christian town that provided refuge for Shiite residents who fled during the 2006 war, there's no room for further displacement this time around.
""The circumstances are different now, and we have no available rental homes,"" said Charbel, a Qlaiaa local.
Life in Qlaiaa seems relatively normal. Some farmers have begun the olive harvesting season, and local olive oil mills have opened their doors, producing olive oil.
However, Charbel does not hide the fact that only about forty families from the original town population remain permanently.
The rest have left for Beirut, fearing a repeat of the July 2006 war.
""No one knows the consequences, and live fire continues to be heard, leaving fear within homes,"" Charbel told Asharq Al-Awsat.
The town, where the Lebanese Forces party holds substantial influence, strongly opposes any missile launches from its vicinity.
Locals believe that launching missiles from outside the town towards Israel would jeopardize the stability of the people who refuse to forcibly push some villages into the war.

Israel Strikes Near Gaza's Largest Hospital after Accusing Hamas of Using It as a Base,"

Israel Strikes Near Gaza's Largest Hospital after Accusing Hamas of Using It as a Base

Israeli warplanes carried out airstrikes early Sunday near Gaza's largest hospital, which is packed with patients and tens of thousands of Palestinians seeking shelter, residents said. Israel has said Gaza's militant Hamas rulers have a command post under the hospital, without providing much evidence.
The strikes came a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a ""second stage"" in Israel's war on Hamas, three weeks after Hamas launched a brutal incursion into Israel Oct. 7. Tanks and infantry pushed into Gaza over the weekend in what officials described as a widening ground offensive as Israel pounded the territory from air, land and sea.
The bombardment - described by Gaza residents as the most intense of the war - knocked out most communications in the territory late Friday, largely cutting off the besieged enclave's 2.3 million people from the world. Communications were restored to many people in Gaza early Sunday, according to local telecoms companies, Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org and confirmation on the ground.
In a sign of growing chaos in Gaza, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said thousands of people broke into its Gaza aid warehouses to take food and other ""basic survival items"" like hygiene products. Thomas White, the agency's director in Gaza, said the break-in was ""a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down.""
The agency, known as UNRWA, provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza. Its schools across the territory have been transformed into packed shelters housing Palestinians displaced by the conflict.
Residents said the latest airstrikes destroyed most of the roads leading to Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, in the northern part of the besieged territory. Israel says most residents have heeded its orders to flee to the south, but hundreds of thousands remain in the north, in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones.
Tens of thousands are sheltering in Shifa, which is also packed with patients wounded in the strikes.
""Reaching the hospital has become increasingly difficult,"" Mahmoud al-Sawah, who is sheltering in the hospital, said over the phone. ""It seems they want to cut off the area."" Another Gaza City resident, Abdallah Sayed, said the Israeli bombing over the past two days was ""the most violent and intense"" since the war started.
The Israeli military had no immediate comment when asked about reports of strikes near Shifa.
The army recently released computer-generated images showing what it said were Hamas installations in and around Shifa Hospital, as well as interrogations of captured Hamas fighters who might have been speaking under duress. Israel has made similar claims before, but has not substantiated them.
Little is known about Hamas' tunnels and other infrastructure, and the claims could not be independently verified. Hamas' government dismissed the allegations as ""lies"" and said they were ""a precursor for striking this facility.""
On Saturday, the Israeli military released grainy images showing tank columns moving slowly in open areas of Gaza, apparently near the border, and said warplanes had bombed dozens of Hamas tunnels and underground bunkers.
The escalation ratcheted up domestic pressure on Israel's government to secure the release of some 230 hostages seized in the Oct. 7 rampage, when Hamas fighters from Gaza breached Israel's defenses and stormed into nearby towns, gunning down civilians and soldiers in a surprise attack.
Desperate family members met with Netanyahu on Saturday and expressed support for an exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.
Hamas' top leader in Gaza, Yehia Sinwar, said Palestinian militants ""are ready immediately"" to release all hostages if Israel releases all of the thousands of Palestinians held in its prisons. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, dismissed the offer as ""psychological terror.""
Netanyahu told the nationally televised news conference that Israel is determined to bring back all the hostages, and maintained that the expanding ground operation ""will help us in this mission."" He said he couldn't reveal everything that is being done due to the sensitivity and secrecy of the efforts.
""This is the second stage of the war, whose objectives are clear: to destroy the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and bring the hostages home,"" he said in his first time taking questions from journalists since the war began.
Netanyahu also acknowledged that the Oct. 7 ""debacle,"" in which more than 1,400 people were killed, would need a thorough investigation, adding that ""everyone will have to answer questions, including me.""
The Israeli military said it was gradually expanding its ground operations inside Gaza, while stopping short of calling it an all-out invasion. Casualties on both sides are expected to rise sharply as Israeli forces and Palestinian militants battle in dense residential areas.
""We are proceeding with the stages of the war according to an organized plan,"" Hagari, the military spokesman, said. The comments hinted at a strategy of staged escalation, instead of a massive and overwhelming offensive.
Despite the Israeli offensive, Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, with the constant sirens in southern Israel a reminder of the threat.
The Palestinian death toll in Gaza rose Saturday to just over 7,700 people since the war began, with 377 deaths reported since late Friday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Most of those killed have been women and minors, the ministry said.
An estimated 1,700 people remain trapped beneath the rubble, according to the Health Ministry, which has said it bases its estimates on distress calls it received.
Israel says its strikes target Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate among civilians, putting them in danger.
More than 1.4 million people across Gaza have fled their homes, nearly half crowding into UN schools and shelters, following repeated warnings by the Israeli military that they would be in danger if they remained in northern Gaza. No one has been allowed out of the sealed-off territory, and Israel has allowed only a trickle of food and medical aid to enter from Egypt.
Gaza's sole power plant shut down shortly after the start of the war, and Israel has allowed no fuel to enter, saying Hamas would use it for military purposes.
Hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other life-saving equipment, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees is also trying to keep water pumps and bakeries running to meet essential needs.
The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region, with Lebanon's militant Hezbollah trading fire with Israel along the border.
In recent days, both Israel and the US have struck targets in Syria that they say are linked to Iran, which backs Hamas, Hezbollah and other armed groups in the Middle East. The US said it was responding to attacks on American forces in Syria and Iraq.
Israeli forces have also traded fire with Palestinian fighters in the occupied West Bank, where over 100 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, mostly during military raids and violent protests.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said three Palestinians were killed early Sunday as Israeli forces carried out raids across the occupied territory, where Israel says it has detained hundreds of Hamas members.

The harshest wars are the ones whose belligerents believe that retreat is impossible because it is tantamount to a devastating defeat and existential threat. The war between Israel and Hamas appears to be one of these wars and will likely lead to massive humanitarian losses and have military, security, political and economic repercussions.
From the beginning, the bone-crushing battle took on a frightening turn. It will lead to widespread destruction, countless widows and orphans and leave international law in tatters. The most dangerous wars are the ones that unfold with an international authority that is helpless in stopping this collective punishment and that threatens to lead to a new nakba over the old one.
The world doesn't need a reminder of the powerful blow dealt to the image of the UN Security Council and its resolutions, especially in wake of the war on Ukraine and the divisions it created between members of the club of major powers.
Journalism is a painful profession during times of war. You must report its crimes. Small bodies that are retrieved from the rubble of houses. The limbs that are blown off by bombs. The panic of terrified mothers. The helplessness of refugees, who heeded the warnings of pamphlets that urged them to once again quit their land.
The journalist must keep up with the growing death toll. They must keep up with the war machine as it claims territories in total disregard of medics and the journalists themselves. It is as if the camera is more hurtful than rockets. We, the journalists, have been guided by our profession to observe the massive number of graves that have accumulated in the terrible Middle East. We can confidently declare that the current war is the harshest, most dangerous and most terrifying.
I was assaulted by the images yesterday. I recalled Ariel Sharon, who in 1982 besieged Beirut and deprived its people of food, water and electricity. I recalled the pamphlets dropped by Israeli jets at the time that urged the people to seek ""safe routes"" to evacuate the city. I also recalled Yasser Arafat - whose fighters were forced into exile at the time - who returned the Palestinian cause back to its soil, specifically the West Bank and Gaza.
In those days, Israel was stronger and its deterrence power greater. Both Hezbollah and Hamas did not exist yet and Iran was mired in its war with Iraq. The greatest question is: did the security and military institution in Israel grow so arrogant that it believed that it could establish security and stability over the rubble of the rights of Palestinians?
The current war in Gaza is more dangerous than previous confrontations. The Hamas attack has shocked Israel with the number of victims it has claimed and hostages it has taken. It dealt a blow to the image of deterrence that the Israeli army is so attached to.
Statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the defense minister and military officials confirm that the ""battle is fateful."" They have spoken of annihilating Hamas and completely altering the situation that was in Gaza before the attack took place. The formation of an Israeli war cabinet was the best evidence of the danger Israel felt. This feeling will allow the generals free reign, which could lead to a destructive war that could expand in the region and whose losses would be innumerable.
The current war is more dangerous than the previous ones. Some observers fear that the war in Gaza may be the first chapter in a greater battle that would reshape the region. The fears that the war could widen in the region prompted the Biden administration to send two aircraft carriers to the Middle East, in a clear warning to Hamas' supporters that they must not join the fight.
Even though Washington has avoided openly accusing or warning Iran, it is obvious that the message was being directed at it as it alone has the ability to stir the southern Lebanon and Golan fronts. The Israeli strikes on Damascus and Aleppo airports were a fiery Israeli message to Iran, not Syria.
Some have said that Netanyahu was in a difficult spot. The end of the war may spell the end of his political career. When the guns go silent, he will undoubtedly be held responsible for the failure in detecting the al-Qassam Brigades attack and the exposure of the weakness of Israel's security agencies. Some will also accuse him of turning down all political options and leaving violence as the only available choice. He believed that the existence of Hamas is the best way to undermine Palestinians on the international arena and the Palestinian Authority.
It is obvious that a large-scale ground attack on Gaza will lead to all sorts of dangers. A bloody confrontation has already emerged in the West Bank. A ground attack could ignite the Lebanese-Israeli front and perhaps even in the Golan. Some have warned that a war on two fronts may force Netanyahu to declare an all-out war and perhaps even attack Iranian infrastructure to lure the United States into a confrontation with Iran. It is difficult to imagine a scenario in which Iran surrenders to Netanyahu's policy of countering Iranian influence.
Gaza is tied to the region. A ground attack - should it happen - will lead to catastrophic losses of life and possibly widen the conflict. This is why it is more pressing to save civilians from the impending danger and respect international humanitarian law that would stop the escalation and take steps towards ending the war.
There can be no return to the previous status quo. There must be a path towards a political solution and respecting rights. This is the essence of what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken heard from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It is no secret that the US is the most influential power in stopping the escalation and preparing parties to agree to end the war. This mission essentially means saving Gaza from a humanitarian disaster and the region from major collapse.

Humanitarian groups are scrambling to assist civilians caught in the war between Israel and Hamas and determine what aid operations are still safe to continue, efforts that are being complicated by an intensified blockade of Gaza and ongoing fighting.
Two days after Hamas militants went on a rampage that took the world by surprise, Israel increased airstrikes on Gaza and blocked off food, fuel and other supplies from going into the territory, a move that raised concerns at the United Nations and among aid groups operating in the area home to 2.3 million people.
Hamas, in turn, pledged to kill Israelis it abducted if the country's military bombs civilian targets in Gaza without warning.
Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands wounded on both sides, and aid groups operating in the region say there are needs both in Gaza and Israel.
More than 2 tons of medical supplies from the Egyptian Red Crescent have been sent to Gaza and efforts are underway to organize food and other deliveries, according to an Egyptian military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the press. But the United Nations and other aid groups are pleading for more access to help Palestinians who find themselves in the middle of intense fighting.
Doctors Without Borders, which is still operating in Gaza, has to rely on supplies it already has inside the territory because it can't bring any more in, said Emmanuel Massart, a deputy desk coordinator with the organization in Brussels.
The group - which says it only runs programs in Palestinian areas since Israel has strong emergency and health services - reported Monday that it provided treatments to more than 50 people following airstrikes at the Jabalia refugee camp located north of Gaza City.
In addition to helping patients in Gaza, it said it was donating medical supplies to other clinics and hospitals, which have become overcrowded with patients and are experiencing shortages of drugs and fuel that can be used for generators.
If Doctors Without Borders is not able to resupply fairly quickly, Massart said, it will run out of supplies it can use to operate on patients who might be wounded. He also said since the facilities the organization uses are running on generators due to the low supply of electricity, cutting off fuel will present a ""huge problem.""
""If there is no fuel anymore, there is no medical facilities anymore because we cannot run our medical facility without the energy,"" Massart said.
The war has also been deeply disruptive to work Mercy Corps has been doing to provide people in Gaza with necessities like food and water, said Arnaud Quemin, the Middle East regional director for the organization.
Right now, he said the team on the ground is trying to find a scenario that would enable them to get back to work. The blockade of food and other supplies into Gaza is a major worry.
""We are very concerned with the way things are going at this point because it looks like it's going to get worse - very soon,"" Quemin said. The sealing of Gaza, he said, will create ""humanitarian needs very quickly.""
Governments have also been weighing how to respond.
As the fighting intensified, the European Union on late Monday reversed an earlier announcement by an EU commissioner that the bloc was ""immediately"" suspending aid for Palestinian authorities. Instead, the 27-nation group said it would urgently review the assistance it provides in the wake of Hamas' attacks on Israel. Two European countries - Germany and Austria - said they were suspending development aid for Palestinian areas.
Meanwhile, some organizations are stepping up aid efforts in Israel, which has seen displacement because of the violence.
Naomi Adler, CEO of Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America, said a trauma center in Jerusalem that's owned by the organization is treating wounded Israeli soldiers and civilians. About 90% of the patients in the center right now are soldiers, who are typically the first to be brought in for traumatic injuries, Adler said. But the center also accepts anyone who's wounded or injured in the country.
The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, a Jewish humanitarian organization, said on Sunday that it was activating its emergency response team in Israel, where it runs programs to support people with disabilities, the elderly and children and families who've been impacted by the war and prior conflicts. The organization said it was working with its partners, including in the Israeli government, to address what it called an unprecedented emergency.
One organization that helps Palestinian children is shifting its focus, too. Steve Sosebee, the president of Palestine Children's Relief Fund, a US-based charity that helps children in need travel to the US for medical treatment, said given the war, the fund is now looking away from long-term programs and toward more urgent needs for food, medication, clothing and other types of basic humanitarian aid.
But like others, he noted the blockade and security risks to its Gaza staff makes it more challenging to do that.
""There are no areas of security, there are no safe havens,"" Sosebee said. ""And therefore, it's very difficult for us to be out in the field providing humanitarian aid when there are no safe places from the constant bombing and attacks that are taking place over the last 72 hours.""

Over the past decade, the ""peace process"" between Israelis and Palestinians has long been an exercise in endless postponement. However, in recent years, the absence of sustained, widespread violence has produced the illusion of stability.
But even those who did not believe the idea that the status quo was sustainable have been shocked by the devastating outbreak of war since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7.
The past three weeks have seen the loss of life on a horrific scale. For Israel, this is the most devastating loss of civilians in its 75 years of existence. More Palestinians were killed in the first fifteen days of this war than during the Second Intifada, which lasted more than five years, and all rounds of violence since then combined. Worse still, it seems likely that thousands more Palestinian civilians will die if Israel pursues its stated (albeit elusive) goal of eliminating Hamas, and the same result will follow for even Israel's less ambitious goal of eliminating Hamas' infrastructure.
Under these circumstances, the priority must be to stop the rush towards the abyss. To achieve this end, Hamas must unconditionally release the Israeli civilians it holds. The recent release of some detainees was a step forward, and it is realistic to expect that more of them will be freed.
However, Israel does not appear to be in the mood to consider any talk about a ceasefire at this time yet, while the Biden administration was not prepared to pressure the Israelis to consider this option. Instead, the United States urged Israel to postpone a ground invasion of Gaza until more detainees are released. The beginning of such a process would lead to an unparalleled massacre, increase the risk of a broader regional conflict, and perhaps threaten stability in a number of Arab countries. The Israeli invasion of Gaza would further weaken the Palestinian Authority in the face of popular anger in the West Bank.
Given these considerations, it was difficult to digest the contempt directed at the UN Secretary-General by Israeli officials over his recent call for an immediate ceasefire to end what he described as ""epic suffering"" in Gaza, except as an expression of dangerous recklessness and the dissemination of a destructive spirit of aggression.
There is still some hope that the release of detained Israeli civilians will create enough space for Arab and international diplomacy to quickly find an answer to the question of what will happen the ""day after,"" that is, who will rule in the aftermath of the ongoing Israeli operation.
The first ideas that must be completely excluded from consideration are those about imposing any specific arrangement on the Palestinians and forcing them to submit to it. It must also be discarded, without much debate, that the Palestinian Authority, in its current configuration, could provide an answer to this question by returning to exercising its authority over the Gaza Strip.
On the one hand, the Palestinian Authority, as currently constituted, is not likely willing to assume the responsibilities of governing Gaza after the deadly and devastating Israeli attack. Even if the Palestinian Authority expressed its willingness to play this role, it would not be able to do it, especially since its diminishing legitimacy is rapidly fading under the pressure of the ongoing war.
On the other hand, the Palestinian Authority, if properly reconstituted, may provide the best option ""for the next day"" and beyond, providing a link to launch a regionally adopted, internationally supported effort to end the Israeli occupation within a framework that credibly addresses the structural weaknesses that have spoiled the peace process over the past three decades.
The way forward
The Palestinian Authority was established in 1994 as a transitional governing entity in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under the Oslo Accords, which was concluded by the Palestine Liberation Organization on behalf of the Palestinian people. However, the Palestinian Authority and the PLO soon began to suffer from the erosion of legitimacy caused by the failure of the Oslo framework to fulfill the prevailing certainty, the promise of establishing a Palestinian state on the territories occupied by Israel in 1967.
The gradual disappointment with the possibility of achieving this goal, and the accompanying rise in support for armed resistance embraced by Hamas and other political movements that opposed the Oslo framework from the start, have contributed to this feeling. This has led to questioning the continued credibility of the claim that the PLO represents all Palestinians and that it is the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
Along with chronic mismanagement by the PA, the exclusion of many Palestinian political factions and orientations has weakened the standing of the PLO and the PA among Palestinians.
The PLO and the Palestinian Authority should have been reformed and reshaped long ago, and the urgency of this task has never been greater. The first step must be the immediate and unconditional expansion of the PLO to include all major political factions and forces, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.
Hamas won an absolute majority in the last parliamentary elections held in the occupied Palestinian territories in 2006. Although no such elections have been organized since then, opinion polls show that Hamas has continued to enjoy significant popular support. Moreover, it is impossible to see how the PLO can credibly commit to nonviolence as part of any attempt to resume the peace process if Hamas and like-minded factions are not represented.
The PLO can be expanded without having to abandon the requirements of the peace process. But this process must change radically in a way that addresses the root causes behind its failure to achieve its stated goals over the past three decades.
First and foremost, Israel must formally recognize the right of the Palestinians to a sovereign state in the territories it has occupied since 1967. In doing so, Israel will merely reciprocate the substance of the PLO's recognition of Israel's right to exist with security and peace, which formed the cornerstone under the name of mutual recognition in the Oslo Accords in 1993.
Until such recognition is secured, the expanded PLO can adopt a program that reflects the full spectrum of Palestinian views on what would constitute an acceptable settlement, while preserving the possibility of launching a serious peace process in a negotiated framework leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state within ""the two-state solution.""
Finally, by the Basic Law, the Palestinian Authority, through a government approved by the expanded PLO, assumes full responsibility for managing the affairs of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip during a multi-year transitional period. During this stage, all understandings between Israel and the Palestinian Authority and all Israeli and Palestinian Authority operations will be supported by a strict mutual commitment to nonviolence. At the end of that phase, the Palestinian Authority will hold national elections at a date agreed upon at the beginning of the transitional period.
I had previously proposed similar reforms in an article I published in Foreign Affairs magazine in 2014. Since then, there has been no doubt about the feasibility of adopting such reforms, but internal disagreement and factional divisions have prevented their official implementation.
Given the seriousness of the current situation, perhaps the time has finally come to adopt this approach, albeit too late, of course, for the thousands who have died. But with the encouragement and support of Arab countries, this plan can offer a trustworthy way forward. Whatever the flaws of this vision, it would certainly be better than the options Israel is now considering, all of which would lead to more violence and bloodshed while diminishing the chances of reaching a lasting peace.

4 Hezbollah Fighters Killed as Tensions Flare along Lebanon and Israel Border,"

4 Hezbollah Fighters Killed as Tensions Flare along Lebanon and Israel Border

Tensions flared Tuesday along the Lebanon-Israel border, leaving four Hezbollah fighters dead, the largest number in a single day since the militant group and Israeli military started clashing last week.
Israeli forces and armed groups in Lebanon have engaged in a series of low-level skirmishes since the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza between the Israeli military and the Hamas militant group.
The escalation comes amid fears that the war could spread into Lebanon, where Hezbollah has expressed strong support to the militant Palestinian group. Israel considers the heavily-armed group in Lebanon as its biggest threat, which has said a ground incursion into the blockaded Gaza Strip would lead to an escalation. So far, artillery exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel have been limited to several towns along the border.
Israel has threatened that if Hezbollah opens a new front, all of Lebanon will suffer the consequences.
Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006 that ended in a draw. Since then, apart from limited clashes and escalated rhetoric, Hezbollah's military caliber has significantly increased, and became a key military actor in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region.
The international community has scrambled to keep the war from extending into Lebanon, and possibly the rest of the region.
An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon landed in the town of Metula in northern Israel on Tuesday, wounding three people, according to the Ziv Medical Center in Safed.
Hours later, Hezbollah issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack. It wasn't clear if the injured were civilians or soldiers, but Israel has ordered civilians to evacuate the area near the border with Lebanon.
Israel responded by striking several areas along the border in southern Lebanon with artillery fire and white phosphorus, the state-run National News Agency in Lebanon reported. The Israeli military said its tanks fired back into Lebanon after an anti-tank missile was launched across the border.
Two more anti-tank missiles were fired from Lebanon at the Yiftah kibbutz in northern Israel without any casualties, the Israeli army said, adding that it had shelled Hezbollah positions in response.
Hezbollah identified the four killed fighters as Mahmoud Baez, Hussien Fasai, Hussein al-Tawil, and Mahdi Atwi, but didn't provide further details about their deaths. Hamas said that the bodies of three of their militants in Lebanon had been captured by the Israeli military following a cross-border operation on Oct. 9.
An Israeli army spokesperson said that air defenses intercepted a drone approaching the border from Lebanon.
Earlier Tuesday, the Israeli military said it killed four militants who had attempted to plant explosive devices on a border wall between Israel and Lebanon. A video from an Israeli army reconnaissance drone showed the militants near the separation wall as they were targeted, causing an explosion.
The Lebanese Red Cross said in a statement that it was en route to collect four bodies killed in Israeli strikes over the southern border town of Alma al-Shaab. A spokesperson declined to provide more details.
Last week, militants from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in southern Lebanon crossed the border and clashed with Israeli troops, killing three and wounding several others. The militants were killed, and the Palestinian group held funerals for two of them.
Türkiye's foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, who arrived in Beirut on Tuesday, told reporters after meeting with his Lebanese counterpart that the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas ""might lead to greater wars.""
""We are doing all we can so that the war does not spread to other countries,"" he said.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said on Sunday that Israel has struck the outskirts of two towns in southwest Lebanon including Shayhin and Imm el-Tut.
Escalating exchanges of fire between Israeli forces, and Hezbollah and armed Palestinian factions on the Lebanese-Israeli border have been ongoing since the outbreak of the October 7 Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
NNA said Israeli surveillance planes continued to hover over Lebanese territories since early dawn on Sunday.
Israel conducted several air raids and launched military drones over the outskirts of border towns of Naqoura and Aita al-Shaab.
According to the agency, ""Saturday was the most violent day since the outbreak of the war, after the enemy struck civilian targets more than 40 kilometers inside Lebanon.""
It also said that Israel fired light flares that filled the skies of the western and central sectors throughout last night. Israel also used incendiary bombs on the forests adjacent to the Blue Line.

Throughout history, at least until our post-modernist times, war was regarded as the highest of human pursuits, one that enlisted other pursuits such as politics, industry, and even literature in its service. Aristotle gave war a thumbs up because it was ""the key to peace."" Neo-Platonics regarded war as the ultimate organizer and guardian of hierarchies within the ""polis"" (state) and among various states.
Over time, however, war, like some other human pursuits has lost part of what the French would call its ""authenticity"", leaving us with ersatz wars motivated by folie de grandeur, racial and religious hatred, and mercenary interests.
The old war was regarded as a continuation of politics by other means. In other words, it was resorted to when all other means including politics, diplomacy, trade, and propaganda had failed to preserve the hierarchy needed to sustain a stable status quo.
Nowadays, however, war is often used as the opening gambit in many confrontations with those who start it indicating their unwillingness to stay the course. This leads to a sort of Dutch auction in which, instead of bidding above the price quoted, the bidder offers a lower figure.
Russia's war against Ukraine is one example.
Vladimir Putin launched the war by stating its goal to be ""wiping the Nazi state off the map.""
When it became clear that the stated goal was too ambitious, he reduced it to annexing certain chunks of Ukrainian territory plus Crimea.
Last month he bid even lower by saying all he was interested in was protecting the ethnic Russian communities in the areas he already holds. Interestingly, Putin's Dutch auction attracted little attention if only because Ukraine's supporters now had their own higher goal of cutting Russia down to size. How long will they stay the course before they, too, go for Dutch auction remains to be seen.
As a result, this strange war is morphing into a pointless struggle that ignores the first rule of war which is the setting of a final objective, in other words, a clear-cut victory.
Wars do not end with one protagonist declaring victory; they end when one protagonist admits defeat. In our postmodern era, however, a loser is not always allowed to accept his loss.
Israel fought several wars with Arab states and, in classical terms, emerged as victor. But then what is called ""the international community"" intervened to declare a draw and pass resolutions that put winner and loser on equal footing with an invitation to negotiate a peace accord.
In Vietnam, after the Tet Offensive, it was clear that the US had achieved complete military victory.
But, there, too Washington was forced to not claim victory but to give in to domestic and international opinion and hand over the country to the losing side.
Sometimes, the winner falls victim to hubris or missionary dreams. In both Afghanistan and Iraq, the US won the war against its stated enemies but was drawn into the nation-building trap that diluted the initial victory beyond recognition.
In both instances, a case could be made for using war as a means of removing hurdles to democratization. But it was naïve to believe that democracy could be built by war. What Afghans and Iraqis did after hurdles to democracy had been removed had to be left to them; they did what the most active, not say violent, elements among them decided to do.
Over time, all wars acquire a global aspect and, in a sense, could be regarded as world wars. The current war between Israel and Hamas has seen demonstrations and counter-demonstrations in more than 60 countries, and divided members of the United Nations into pro-Israel or pro-Hamas camps. It has caused a rise in the price of petrol, nudging inflation higher, and a fall in the value of the Israeli currency (shekel). It has also put a stop to investment by those who had been helping Hamas build its war-making capabilities.
Always an important factor in waging war, propaganda has assumed a role never imagined before. What is called information war is now able to transform the aggressor into the victim and vice versa. The difference between what adversaries should and could do or not do is effaced.
For example, the fact that had Hamas not attacked Israel there would have been no war if only because Israel had no interest in invading Gaza which Ariel Sharon had evacuated..
What Israel wanted from Hamas was not to launch an attack, something that Hamas could have easily offered. But what Hamas wanted, the elimination of Israel as a nation-state, was and remains impossible for Israel to contemplate let alone deliver.
Despite Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu's rhetorical outbursts the current struggle, presented as a war, may end up as a trompe l'oeil version of war. Even if possible, a return to the status quo that was shattered by the Hamas attack is undesirable if only because of its conceptual fragility. A new status quo based on full reoccupation of the enclave is equally undesirable because, tested for decades, it provided no security for Israel.
Israel would need to review other elements in the previous status quo. The Iron Dome and the ultra-technological Gaza fence have proved to be as fragile as Troy's fortifications though they had been built by Poseidon himself.
Hours after the attack, Netanyahu, impacted by the heat of the moment, declared ""the total elimination of Hamas"" as his war objective. Three weeks later, he must have had time to realize that what matters beyond the physical elimination of Hamas is to build a new status quo that could turn Gaza from a base for attack on Israel into a glacis protecting it.
That means finding Palestinian partners who, while not sharing Hamas's unrealistic ""wipe Israel off the map"" narrative, enjoy a modicum of credibility among Gazavis.
We have little information about what Gazavis really think. But there is anecdotal evidence as well as some direct information, albeit limited, showing that Hamas ruled Gaza more through oppression, propaganda, and corruption than genuine popular appeal.
Even if they share the dream of seeing Israel disappear, many Gazavis might have realized that Hamas has failed to deliver and, even worse, shattered the living-and-half-living life that the enclave had built since Israeli occupation ended in 2005.
Unless Israel finds a way to translate its military victory, if such is the outcome, into a new status quo that makes enduring peace possible, it would look like one who wins a heap of chips in a casino only to find out he cannot cash them at the counter.

Hamas-Israel War Slams Door on Cautious US-Iran Thaw

Through quiet diplomacy with Iran, US President Joe Biden's administration had strived to keep a lid on Middle East troubles. That bet came crashing down with Saturday's massive offensive by Hamas against Israel.
Iran's clerical leadership openly supports the movement, which controls the blockaded and impoverished Gaza Strip, and hailed the sneak attack that inflicted the deadliest blow on Israel in decades.
The Biden administration has engaged in cautious talks with Iranian officials, and reached an agreement last month that freed five Americans.
While making limited headway on the key issue of Iran's nuclear program, US officials have alluded to tacit understandings with Tehran to turn down the temperature.
Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security advisor, told a September 27 event that Iranian-backed attacks in Iraq have stopped ""for now"" and pointed to a de facto truce in war-ravaged Yemen, where Tehran backs the Houthi militias.
""The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades,"" Sullivan said, while cautioning that the situation could change and listing Iran's nuclear program and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as festering issues.
Less than two weeks later, Hamas launched its surprise attack against Israel, leaving US diplomats scrambling to try and contain the outbreak of violence from spreading in the region.
The rival Republican Party has gone on the attack against Biden over the violence, pointing to the deal to free prisoners, which required the transfer of $6 billion in Iranian oil revenue frozen in South Korea to an account in Qatar.
There is no evidence the money went to Hamas. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""not a single dollar"" has been dispensed and that the funds are restricted to humanitarian purchases.
But beyond the money, some experts said the offensive showed the limitations of Biden's approach with Iran.
""The deal with Iran was not just about prisoner release, but establishing some kind of a process that could potentially de-escalate the conflict between the two states,"" said Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
""I have to say, I see no indications that Iranians are actually interested in de-escalating,"" he said.
How much support?
Blinken, speaking to NBC News, said the United States did not have ""anything that shows us that Iran was directly involved in this attack, in planning it or in carrying it out.""
But he added Hamas ""wouldn't be Hamas without the support it's had for many years from Iran.""
Neomi Neumann, the former head of research for Israel's internal security agency Shin Bet, pointed to threats by Hezbollah, Iran's Shiite allies in Lebanon, to launch a second front if Israeli forces enter the Gaza Strip.
While the United States historically has prioritized containing Iran's contested nuclear program, Neumann said it would be a mistake to reach any agreement that ""fails to address demands to end subversion in the region and support for terrorist groups.""
""It seems that this view is shared by governments in the region, who see the Iranian threat in the same way,"" she said.
Riskier to escalate?
Iran's rulers have seen Israel and the United States as arch-enemies since taking power in the 1979 revolution that toppled the Western-oriented shah, who was Israel's main regional ally.
Israel, while embarrassed by the intelligence failure to prevent Saturday's assault, has made little secret of its ability to strike inside Iran, including through killings of nuclear scientists and cyberattacks.
Ali Vaez, who follows Iran at the International Crisis Group, which promotes peaceful resolution of conflicts, said that the de-escalation between Iran and the United States was never comprehensive.
""It did not cover Iran's tensions with Israel, which are never far from the surface,"" he said.
""But the US has very little to gain by escalating against Iran amid this Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" he said.
""That would only add a perilous nuclear crisis to the existing tragic turmoil in Ukraine and the Levant as US presidential elections draw closer.""

Israel Deploys Missile Boats in Red Sea as Houthis Attack from Yemen

The Israeli military said it had deployed missile boats in the Red Sea on Wednesday as reinforcements, a day after the Iran-aligned Houthi militias said they had launched missile and drone attacks on Israel and vowed to carry out more.
Images disseminated by the military showed Saar-class corvettes patrolling near Eilat port in the Red Sea, which Israel sees as a new front as its war in Gaza draws retaliation from Iran-aligned pro-Hamas forces elsewhere in the region.
The Houthis said on Tuesday they had launched three drone and missile attacks towards Israel since the start of the Hamas-Israel war on Oct. 7. It vowed there would be more such attacks to come ""to help the Palestinians to victory"".
In what appeared to be a new attack overnight, the Israeli military said it had intercepted an ""aerial threat"" over the Red Sea.
Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said on Tuesday the Houthi attacks were intolerable, but declined to elaborate when asked how Israel might respond.
The Houthis are part of the Iran-aligned regional alliance hostile to Israel and the United States which includes Lebanon's Hezbollah and Iran-backed militias in Iraq.
The Houthis govern swathes of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, more than a thousand miles from Israel.
Missiles and drones fired at Israel from the Red Sea area since Oct. 7 have so far either been shot down or fallen short.
In an Oct. 27 incident, Israel said the Houthis were behind a drone attack that caused explosions in two Egyptian towns on the Red Sea, saying they had been intended to hit Israel.

Israel Strikes Crowded Gaza Camp; Says Hamas Commander Killed

Israeli airstrikes hit a densely populated refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, killing at least 50 Palestinians and a Hamas commander, and medics struggled to treat the casualties in the enclave where food, fuel and basic supplies are running scarce.
The Israeli military said 11 soldiers were also killed in fighting in Gaza on Tuesday, the biggest one-day loss for the armed forces since Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 300 soldiers and some 1,100 civilians.
Israel's Army Radio said most of the dead were infantrymen whose vehicle was struck by an anti-armor missile.
Israel sent its forces into Gaza following weeks of air bombardments in retaliation for the attack by Iran-backed Hamas, and an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) statement said the airstrikes on Jabalia, Gaza's largest refugee camp, had killed Ibrahim Biari, a Hamas commander it said was ""pivotal"" in the planning and execution of the assault.
Dozens of Hamas combatants were in the same underground tunnel complex as Biari and were also killed when it collapsed in the attack, IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus said.
""I understand that is also the reason why there are many reports of collateral damage and non-combatant casualties. We're looking into those as well,"" he said.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem denied any senior commander was in the camp, and called the claim an Israeli pretext for killing civilians. Palestinian health officials said at least 50 Palestinians were killed and 150 wounded.
A Hamas statement said there were 400 dead and injured in Jabalia, which houses families of refugees from wars with Israel dating back to 1948. Reuters could not independently verify the reported casualty figures.
The blast left large craters surrounded by wrecked buildings. Israel repeatedly warned Gaza residents to evacuate northern areas and while many have gone south, many have stayed.
Israel besieged Gaza after the Hamas attack, and the UN and other aid officials said civilians in the enclave were living in a public health catastrophe, with hospitals struggling to treat casualties as electricity supplies petered out.
On Wednesday, communications and internet services were completely cut off in the enclave again, Gaza's largest telecommunications provider Paltel said.
Public health crisis engulfs Gaza
In Washington, a group of anti-war protesters raised red-stained hands to interrupt a hearing in Congress on providing more aid to Israel. They shouted slogans including, ""Ceasefire now!"" ""Protect the children of Gaza!"" and ""Stop funding genocide."" Capitol police removed them from the room.
Power generators in Al Shifa Medical complex and the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza will run out of fuel in a few hours, Ashraf Al-Qidra, spokesperson for the health ministry in Gaza said. He called on petrol stations owners in the enclave to urgently feed the two hospitals with fuel if possible.
After the attack on Jabalia, dozens of bodies lay shrouded in white, lined up against the side of the Indonesian Hospital, footage obtained by Reuters showed.
Juggling dwindling supplies of medicines, power cuts and air or artillery strikes that have shaken hospital buildings, surgeons in Gaza have worked night and day trying to save a constant stream of patients.
""We take it an hour at a time because we don't know when we will be receiving patients. Several times we've had to set up surgical spaces in the corridors and even sometimes in the hospital waiting areas,"" Dr. Mohammed al-Run said.
Hamas has told mediators it will soon release some of the 200 or so foreign captives it had taken during the attack on Israel, Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson of the group's armed wing, al-Qassam Brigades, said in a video on the Telegram app on Tuesday. He gave no further details on the number of captives or their nationalities.
Meanwhile, Israeli families of victims of the Oct. 7 attack appealed to the International Criminal Court on Tuesday to order an investigation into the killings and abductions. Israel is not a member of the Hague-based court and refuses to recognize its jurisdiction.
'Progress' on safe passage for foreigners
The United States has made ""real progress"" in the last few hours in negotiations to secure a safe passage for Americans and other foreign nationals who wish to leave Gaza, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Israel on Friday for meetings with members of the government and then make other stops in the region, the department said.
On Tuesday, Blinken said the United States and other countries were looking at ""a variety of possible permutations"" for the future of Gaza if Hamas militants are removed from control. Israel has vowed to annihilate Hamas after several inconclusive wars dating back to the militant group's 2007 takeover of Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed international calls for a ""humanitarian pause"" in fighting to enable emergency aid deliveries to civilians suffering from critical shortages of food, medicine, drinking water and fuel.
The US, Qatar and Egypt have been working to open the Rafah crossing into Egypt to allow people to come and go.
Egyptian authorities would allow 81 Gazans who were severely wounded in the weeks of bombardment to enter Egypt on Wednesday to complete treatment, the Palestinian border authority said.

As Gaza War Rages, Israeli Forces Kill 27 Palestinians in West Bank

As Israel declared war on Hamas and pounded Gaza following Saturday's devastating attack by the movement, violence has risen in the occupied West Bank, risking escalation after more than a year of continuous flare-ups.
Israeli security forces have killed at least 27 Palestinians during clashes in the West Bank since Saturday, as Palestinian factions called on people in the Palestinian territory to join the fight against Israel's occupation.
On Wednesday, three Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli security forces and masked Jewish settlers in Qusra village near the northern West Bank city of Nablus, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said, after the Israeli army said it was supplying licensed citizens with thousands of firearms ""to bolster defense systems"" across the country.
The Israeli military has said it is prepared for an escalation in the West Bank and its forces have been on high alert, carrying out arrests and thwarting possible attacks.
""Anyone who challenges us in Judea and Samaria will be met with huge force,"" military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said this week, using Jewish biblical names for the West Bank.
By Wednesday, military checkpoints remained closed and roads in several parts of the West Bank were blocked with mounds of dirt, restricting movement.
After hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced out of their homes in the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, Palestinians have sought an independent state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.
That prospect seems as far away as ever amid expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, cutting communities from each other, and a freeze in US-sponsored negotiations.
Human rights groups have said Israeli authorities have systematically repressed Palestinians for decades in policies that amount to apartheid and since 2007 have imposed a crushing land, air and sea closure on Gaza's population.
'Israel is our enemy'
The Palestinian Authority (PA), which exercises limited governance in areas of the West Bank, is led by the Fatah faction, a rival to Hamas, which pushed Fatah out of Gaza after a brief conflict in 2006-07. However, PA leaders have expressed sympathy with Gaza in the war with Israel.
""Israel is our enemy and occupier and it is our people's right to defend themselves,"" said Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh at a government meeting on Monday, even as several Western backers of the PA considered suspending aid.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry, which has repeatedly raised the danger of increased assaults on Palestinians waged by armed Jewish settlers, warned against supplying settlers in the West Bank with more arms amid surging violence, describing it as a provocation that would ""blow things up in the West Bank"".
Five minors were among the deaths since Saturday, Palestinian officials said, adding that more than 130 Palestinians had been wounded, many in confrontations with the military across the West Bank. At least one of the people killed was claimed by an armed Palestinian group.
With uncertainty growing around who will replace the PA's unpopular octogenarian president, Hamas has been making efforts to expand its influence in the West Bank.
Since the movement launched the deadliest Palestinian militant attack on Israel in the country's 75-year history, it has repeatedly called on Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank to join the fight and resist occupation.
Despite entrenched political divides, President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party, which dominates the PA's institutions in the West Bank, said Palestinians outside the coastal enclave should also resist Israel's decades-old occupation and confront Israel's military.
Violence in the West Bank had already been surging, with stepped up Israeli military raids, settler assaults on Palestinian towns and a spate of Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis. This year's Palestinian death toll until Saturday was over 220 and at least 29 people in Israel had been killed, according to UN records.

Month After War on Gaza: Palestinian Deaths Top Russia-Ukraine War Toll

The number of deaths one month since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza reached frightening numbers as the situation becomes increasingly horrifying, portending more victims.
Israel announced the war could be extended for several months, perhaps even a year.
Palestinian sources confirmed that the number of Palestinians killed in one month exceeded the number of deaths in the Ukraine war, which reached 9,806 victims over nearly two years.
Palestinian health authorities said the death toll from Israeli strikes had exceeded 10,328, while Israel estimates their number at more than 20,000, including 4,237 children and 2,716 women, in addition to 25,956 injuries.
More than 120,000 homes were destroyed and about 1.2 million citizens have been displaced.
In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israel killed 220 people, arrested 2,215 others, and demolished 120 homes.
According to Israeli reports, the number of deaths is more than that of the 1967 war that Israel fought against three Arab armies, with 779 deaths, including 850 civilians and 5,500 injuries.
The Israeli government evacuated 115,000 residents, while about 109,000 decided to leave from 29 settlements surrounding the Gaza Strip and 22 others on the Lebanese border.
According to the Israelis, the war began in response to Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, and the capturing of 240 Israelis and foreigners as hostages.
Israel officially declared war on Hamas to ""annihilate"" the movement and terminate its ability to rule and its military capabilities.
Tel Aviv admitted it had taken a new form of warfare, bombing Gaza without mercy from afar, using the air force, navy, artillery, and tanks to destroy any place where Hamas leaders or any of its armed members were located, even if it was crowded with civilians.
It claims Hamas leaders were hiding in places close to civilians and are using them as human shields. As a result of these claims, Israel has bombed hospitals and schools.
Three weeks into this terrible bombing, the Israeli army began a ground operation searching for Hamas leaders and kidnapped Israelis.
Israel insists that the attack has nothing to do with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that the movement is pursuing a brutal path in its war against Jewish civilians and even Muslim Arabs.
In response, Palestinians say Israel has been insisting on besieging the Gaza Strip for 16 years, and from time to time, launched a military operation in which it destroys the enclave, killing thousands of Palestinians and exacerbating the economic and social situation there.
They said Israel continues its occupation of the West Bank and Judaization of Jerusalem with massive settlement projects, violating the sanctity of al-Aqsa Mosque. It carries out widespread arrests and degrades prisoners.
Tel Aviv allows settlers to carry out bloody criminal attacks on Palestinians and denies their rights.
- The hysteric Israeli response
Palestinians said the Hamas attack came within the framework of resistance to the occupation's projects, describing the Israeli response as hysterical because Tel Aviv did not imagine Palestinians were capable of penetrating their fortified defenses and carry out a successful military attack.
They added that Israel wants to implement its old plans to destroy Gaza and deport its people to Egypt, with the hope of expelling the Palestinians from the West Bank to Jordan later.
Palestinians called the war the second Nakba, saying the Israeli army drops a thousand tons of explosives every day to implement those goals, with the support of the US administration and Western governments.
The US and the West are not fulfilling their moral and humanitarian duty to deter the Israeli war of annihilation, they stressed.

Israeli Soldiers Kill Several Hamas Fighters at Start of Raid on Al-Shifa Hospital,"

Israeli Soldiers Kill Several Hamas Fighters at Start of Raid on Al-Shifa Hospital

Israeli soldiers killed several Hamas militants at the outset of a raid on the Al-Shifa hospital on Wednesday, where thousands of Palestinian civilians - patients, displaced people and medical staff - have been trapped during weeks of fighting.
Israel said it launched the raid because Hamas has a command center underneath Al-Shifa and uses connected tunnels to conceal military operations and to hold hostages. Hamas denies it.
""Before entering the hospital our forces were confronted by explosive devices and terrorist squads, fighting ensued in which terrorists were killed,"" the Israeli military said, without specifying exactly where the firefight took place.
Israeli Army Radio said five militants had been killed and that weapons were found inside the Al-Shifa compound.
Global calls for a humanitarian ceasefire have mounted in recent days as Al-Shifa became the focus of Israel's war on Hamas, and fears grew for the thousands of people trapped there, on the front line of the conflict.
Earlier on Wednesday, Dr. Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the health ministry for the Hamas-led administration in Gaza, told Al Jazeera television that Israeli forces had raided the western side of the medical complex and believed an explosion occurred inside the hospital.
The surgery and emergency departments were raided first, Mohammed Zaqout, the ministry's director of hospitals, told the broadcaster.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm the situation at Al-Shifa.
In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity, IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa hospital.""
Israeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told CNN the hospital and compound were for Hamas ""a central hub of their operations, perhaps even the beating heart and maybe even a center of gravity.""
The US said on Tuesday that its own intelligence supported Israel's conclusions.
Hamas said on Wednesday that US announcement had effectively given a ""green light"" for Israel to raid the hospital. The group said it held Israel and US President Joe Biden fully responsible for the operation.
""We do not support striking a hospital from the air and we don't want to see a firefight in a hospital where innocent people, helpless people, sick people trying to get medical care they deserve are caught in the crossfire. Hospitals and patients must be protected,"" a White House National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement.
Israeli forces have waged fierce street battles against Hamas fighters over the past 10 days before advancing into the center of Gaza City and surrounding Al-Shifa.
The Israeli military said on Wednesday that two soldiers were killed fighting in the northern Gaza Strip yesterday, raising to 48 the confirmed Israeli death toll since the ground offensive began.
Israel has sworn to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the militants' cross-border assault into Israel on Oct 7. Israel says Hamas killed 1,200 people in the rampage and took more than 240 hostage.
In the West Bank, a separate Palestinian enclave not controlled by Hamas, Palestinian Authority Health Minister Mai Alkaila said Israel was ""committing a new crime against humanity, medical staff and patients by besieging"" Al-Shifa.
""We hold the occupation forces fully responsible for the lives of the medical staff, patients and displaced people in Al-Shifa,"" Alkaila said in a statement.
Dire conditions
Al Shifa is a sprawling complex of buildings and courtyards a few hundred meters from Gaza City's fishing port. Buildings on the western side of the complex, which the Gaza official said was the site of the raid, include the internal medicine and dialysis departments.
Hamas says 650 patients and 5,000 to 7,000 other civilians are trapped inside the hospital grounds, under constant fire from Israeli snipers and drones. Amid shortages of fuel, water and supplies, it says 40 patients have died in recent days.
Thirty-six babies are left from the neo-natal ward after three died. Without fuel for generators to power incubators, the babies were being kept as warm as possible, lined up eight to a bed.
The Israeli military said on Wednesday: ""We can confirm that incubators, baby food and medical supplies brought by IDF tanks from Israel have successfully reached the Shifa hospital. Our medical teams and Arabic speaking soldiers are on the ground to ensure that these supplies reach those in need.""
Palestinians trapped in the hospital dug a mass grave on Tuesday to bury patients who died and no plan was in place to evacuate babies despite Israel announcing an offer to send portable incubators, Qidra, Gaza's health ministry spokesman, said.
Qidra said there were about 100 bodies decomposing inside and no way to get them out.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was deeply disturbed by the ""dramatic loss of life"" in the hospitals, his spokesman said. ""In the name of humanity, the secretary-general calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire,"" the spokesman told reporters.
Medical officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 11,000 people are confirmed dead from Israeli strikes, around 40% of them children, and countless others were trapped under rubble.
Around two-thirds of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been made homeless, unable to escape the territory where food, fuel, fresh water and medical supplies are running out.
Israel's move toward Shifa hospital has raised questions about how it would interpret international laws on protection of medical facilities and the thousands of displaced people sheltering there, UN human rights officials have said.
Israel said in its statement on Wednesday that it had given Gaza authorities 12 hours to cease military activities within the hospital. ""Unfortunately, it did not,"" the military statement said.

Israeli Troops Surround Gaza City, Cut off Northern Part of Besieged Territory

Israeli troops early Monday had surrounded Gaza City and cut off the northern part of the besieged Hamas-ruled territory as communications lost for several hours across Gaza overnight were being restored.
Troops are expected to enter the city Monday or Tuesday, Israeli media reported, and militants who have prepared for years are expected to fight street by street using a vast network of tunnels. Casualties will likely rise on both sides in the month-old war, which has already killed more than 9,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.
Some 1.5 million Palestinians, or around 70% of the population, have fled their homes since the war began with a bloody Hamas incursion into Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. Food, medicine, fuel and water are running low, and UN-run schools-turned-shelters are beyond capacity, with many sleeping on the streets outside.
Israel has so far rejected US suggestions for a pause in fighting to facilitate humanitarian aid deliveries and the release of some of the estimated 240 captives seized by Hamas in its Oct. 7 raid. Israel has also dismissed calls for a broader ceasefire from increasingly alarmed Arab countries - including Jordan and Egypt, which made peace with it decades ago.
In another sign of widening unrest, a Palestinian man stabbed and wounded two members of Israel's paramilitary Border Police in east Jerusalem before being shot dead, according to police and an Associated Press reporter at the scene.
Israel captured east Jerusalem, along with Gaza and the West Bank, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state. Israel annexed east Jerusalem in a move not recognized by most of the international community and considers the entire city its capital.
A Jordanian military cargo plane air-dropped medical aid to a field hospital in northern Gaza, King Abdullah II said early Monday. It appeared to be the first such airdrop of the war, raising the possibility of another avenue for aid delivery besides Egypt's Rafah crossing with Gaza.
The situation remains dire in the north. Some 800,000 people have heeded Israeli military orders to flee to southern Gaza, even though Israel had continued airstrikes in the area. Strikes in central and southern Gaza - the purported safe zone - killed at least 53 people on Sunday.
Hundreds of thousands remain in Gaza City and other parts of the north. Some 2,000 people, many carrying only what they could hold in their arms, walked down Gaza's main north-south highway on Sunday during an hours-long window in which the military had encouraged them to flee.
One man said they walked 500 meters (yards) with their hands raised while passing Israeli troops. Another described seeing bodies along the road. ""The children saw tanks for the first time. Oh world, have mercy on us,"" said one Palestinian man, who declined to give his name.
A majority of Gaza's population are the descendants of Palestinian refugees who fled or were driven out of Israel during the 1948 war surrounding its creation. Palestinians refer to their exodus as the Nakba, or catastrophe, and many fear a repeat as hundreds of thousands are displaced by the latest war.
The Israeli military said late Sunday that it had severed northern Gaza from the south, calling it a ""significant stage"" in the war. It said a one-way corridor for residents to flee south would remain available.
The military says 30 troops have been killed since the ground offensive began over a week ago. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, disrupting daily life even as most are intercepted or fall in open areas. Tens of thousands of Israelis have evacuated from communities near the volatile borders with Gaza and Lebanon.
The military said Monday that aircraft struck 450 targets overnight and took over a Hamas compound. It also said it had killed a senior Hamas militant, identified as Jamal Mussa, who had allegedly carried out a shooting attack against Israeli soldiers in Gaza in 1993.
Communications in Gaza went down late Sunday for the third time in the war, according to the internet access advocacy group NetBlocks.org and the Palestinian telecom company Paltel. Aid workers say the outages make it even harder for civilians to seek safety or even call ambulances.
The first Gaza outage lasted 36 hours, coinciding with the ground invasion, and the second one for a few hours. Paltel and NetBlocks said mobile phone and internet service was restored on Monday.
Food, water and the fuel needed for generators that power hospitals are running low. Gaza's sole power station was forced to shut down shortly after the war broke out and Israel has allowed no fuel to enter, saying Hamas would steal it for military purposes.
Northern Gaza is facing a severe water shortage, as there is no fuel to pump from municipal wells and Israel shut off the region's main line. The UN office for humanitarian affairs said seven water facilities across Gaza were struck over the last two days and sustained ""major damage,"" raising the risk of sewage flooding. Israel has restored two water pipelines in central and southern Gaza, the UN said.
Over 450 trucks carrying food, water, medicine and other basic aid have been allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt since Oct. 21, but aid workers say it's insufficient to meet mounting needs in the territory, which is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians.
The war has stoked wider tensions, with Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group trading fire along the border.
Four civilians were killed by an Israeli airstrike in south Lebanon late Sunday, including three children, a local civil defense official and state-run media reported.
The Israeli military said it had attacked Hezbollah targets in response to anti-tank fire that killed an Israeli civilian. Hezbollah said it fired Grad rockets from southern Lebanon into Israel in response.

Israel Expects Long Gaza Ground War against Hamas, Raising Fears of Open-Ended Conflict

Israel expects to launch a long and difficult ground offensive into Gaza soon to destroy Hamas, the defense minister said Friday, describing a campaign that will require dismantling a vast network of tunnels used by the territory's militant rulers.
Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's comments pointed to a potentially grueling and open-ended new phase of the war, three weeks after Hamas' bloody incursion into southern Israel sparked relentless bombardment in Gaza. Israeli troops carried out a second ground raid into Gaza in as many days, striking the outskirts of Gaza City.
Gallant told a small group of foreign reporters that the invasion ""will take a long time"" and be followed by a lengthy phase of lower-intensity fighting as Israel destroys ""pockets of resistance.""
Israel has said it aims to crush Hamas' rule in Gaza and its ability to threaten Israel. But how Hamas' defeat will be measured and an invasion's endgame remain unclear. Israel says it does not intend to rule the tiny territory of 2.3 million Palestinians but not who it expects to govern - even as Gallant suggested a long-term insurgency could ensue.
In a sign of rising tensions in the region, US warplanes struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on American forces, and two mysterious objects hit towns in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.
The Palestinian death toll in Gaza has soared past 7,300, according to officials there. A blockade on Gaza has meant dwindling supplies of food, fuel, water and medicine, and the UN warned that its aid operation helping hundreds of thousands of people was ""crumbling"" amid near-depleted fuel.
Gaza's Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed list of names and identification numbers of those killed, including more than 3,000 minors and more than 1,500 women.
More than 1,400 people were slain in Israel during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, according to the Israeli government, and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel, including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday, wounding four people.
The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous Israel-Hamas wars, estimated at around 4,000. A ground invasion is expected to cause even higher casualties on both sides as Israeli forces and Hamas battle each other in dense residential areas.
Gazan hospitals have been scrounging for fuel to run emergency generators that power incubators and other life-saving equipment after Israel cut off all fuel deliveries at the start of the war, forcing its only power plant to shut down.
Gallant said Israel believes that Hamas would confiscate any fuel that enters. He said Hamas uses generators to pump air into its hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, which originate in civilian areas. He showed reporters aerial footage of what he said was a tunnel shaft built right next to a hospital.
""For air, they need oil. For oil, they need us,"" he said.
Late Friday, the army released photos showing what it claimed were Hamas installations in and around Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa. Israel has made such claims before, but they declined to say how they obtained the photos.
Little is known about Hamas' tunnels and other infrastructure, and the military's and Gallant's claims couldn't be verified.
Senior Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq called the Israeli reports on al-Shifa ""lies"" to pave the way for strikes on the hospital.
Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City has been overwhelmed by thousands of patients and wounded. Also, tens of thousands of displaced residents have crowded in and around its grounds for shelter, the UN says.
About 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into UN shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered ""accomplices"" of Hamas.
Israel captured Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war and occupied the territory until a unilateral withdrawal in 2005. It has maintained a tight blockade over the area since Hamas rose to power in 2006 parliamentary elections and subsequently seized full control the following year from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority.
The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region.
The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war. Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border.
Last week, a US Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen.

Hamas Frees Two Israeli Women as US Advises Delaying Ground War to Allow Talks on Captives

Hamas on Monday released two elderly Israeli women held hostage in Gaza as the United States expressed increasing concern that the escalating Israel-Hamas war will spark a wider conflict in the region, including attacks on American troops.
The death toll in Gaza rose rapidly as Israel ramped up airstrikes that flattened buildings in what it said was preparation for an eventual ground assault. The United States advised Israel to delay the expected invasion to allow time to negotiate the release of more hostages taken by Hamas during its brutal incursion two weeks ago.
A third small aid convoy from Egypt entered Gaza, where the population of 2.3 million has been running out of food, water and medicine under Israel's sealed border. With Israel still barring entry of fuel, the UN said its distribution of aid would grind to a halt within days when it can no longer fuel trucks inside Gaza. Hospitals flooded by a constant stream of wounded are struggling to keep generators running to power lifesaving medical equipment and incubators for premature babies.
The two freed hostages, 85-year-old Yocheved Lifshitz and 79-year-old Nurit Cooper, were taken out of Gaza at the Rafah crossing into Egypt, where they were put into ambulances, according to footage shown on Egyptian TV. The two women, along with their husbands, were snatched from their homes in the kibbutz of Nir Oz near the Gaza border during Hamas' Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israeli communities. Their husbands, ages 83 and 84, were not released.
""While I cannot put into words the relief that she is now safe, I will remain focused on securing the release of my father and all those — some 200 innocent people — who remain hostages in Gaza,"" Lifshitz' daughter, Sharone Lifschitz, said in a statement.
Lifschitz, an artist and academic in London who uses a different spelling for her name, told reporters last week that her parents were peace activists, and her father would drive to the Gaza border to take Palestinians to east Jerusalem for medical treatment.
Kindness, she said last week, could somehow save them.
""I grew up, you know, with all these Holocaust stories about how all my uncles' lives were saved because"" of acts of kindness, she said.
""Do I want that to be the story here?"" she asked. ""Yeah.""
Hamas apparently received nothing in exchange for the release of the two hostages, who were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter. Hamas and other militants in Gaza are believed to have taken roughly 220 people, including an unconfirmed number of foreigners and dual citizens.
On Monday, Hamas released a video showing the handover of the two elderly hostages, with militants giving drinks and snacks to the dazed but composed women, and holding their hands as they are walked to Red Cross officials. Just before the video ends, Lifshitz reaches back to shake one militant's hand.
Around the same time, Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, released a recording showing a series of prisoners from the Hamas attack – most in clean prison uniforms, but one in a bloody t-shirt and at least one wincing in pain – sitting handcuffed in drab offices talking about the Oct. 7 attack. The men said they were under orders to kill young men, and kidnap women, children and the elderly, and that they'd been promised financial rewards.
The videos were both clearly intended to shape the war's narrative — with Israel focusing on Hamas' brutality, and Hamas trying to show a humane side.
The Associated Press could not independently verify either video, and both the hostages and the prisoners could have been acting under duress.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas. Iranian-backed fighters around the region are warning of possible escalation, including the targeting of US forces deployed in the Middle East, if a ground offensive is launched in Gaza.
The US has told Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups not to join the fight. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire almost daily across the Israel-Lebanon border, and Israeli warplanes have struck targets in the occupied West Bank, Syria and Lebanon in recent days.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said there has been an uptick in rocket and drone attacks by Iranian-backed militias on US troops in Iraq and Syria, and the US was ""deeply concerned about the possibility for any significant escalation"" in the coming days.
He said US officials were having ""active conversations"" with Israeli counterparts about the potential ramifications of escalated military action.
The US advised Israeli officials that delaying a ground offensive would give Washington more time to work with regional mediators on the release of more hostages, according to a US official.
Israeli tanks and ground forces have been massed at the Gaza border, and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops there Monday to keep preparing for an offensive ""because it will come."" He said it will be a combined offensive from air, land and sea, but he did not give a time frame.
A ground offensive is likely to dramatically increase casualties in what is already the deadliest by far of five wars fought between Israel and Hamas since the militant group took power in Gaza in 2007.
More than 1,400 people in Israel have been killed — mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack. At least 222 people were captured and dragged back to Gaza, including foreigners, the military said Monday, updating a previous figure.
More than 5,000 Palestinians, including some 2,000 minors and around 1,100 women, have been killed, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said Monday. That includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. The toll has climbed rapidly in recent days, with the ministry reporting 436 additional deaths in just the last 24 hours.
Israel said it struck 320 militant targets throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours. The military says it does not target civilians, and that Palestinian militants have fired over 7,000 rockets at Israel since the start of the war.
Inside Gaza, the civilian death toll continued to mount.
Fifteen members of the same family were among at least 33 Palestinians buried Monday in a shallow, sandy mass grave at a Gaza hospital after being killed in Israeli airstrikes.
The bodies were laid to rest side by side in the courtyard of al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. Men discussed where to fit the shrouded corpse of a small child. ""Bring them all,"" a gravedigger called out.
Israel carried out limited ground forays into Gaza. On Sunday, Hamas said it destroyed an Israeli tank and two armored bulldozers inside Gaza. The Israeli military said a soldier was killed and three others were wounded by an anti-tank missile during a raid inside Gaza.
On Monday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said 20 trucks entered Gaza carrying food, water, medicine and medical supplies through the Rafah crossing with Egypt, the only way into Gaza not controlled by Israel. It was the third delivery in as many days, each around the same size.
The aid coming in so far is ""a drop in the ocean"" compared with the needs of the population, said Thomas White, the Gaza director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
At least 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza have fled their homes, and nearly 580,000 of them are sheltering in UN-run schools and shelters, the UN said Monday.
No aid will be distributed in Gaza City and other parts of the north, where hundreds of thousands of people remain. Gaza City's main al-Shifa Hospital, with a normal capacity of 700 patients, is currently overwhelmed with 5,000 patients, and around 45,000 displaced people are gathered in and around its grounds for shelter, the UN said.

Gaza Tunnels Pose Challenge to Israel in War on Hamas,"

Gaza Tunnels Pose Challenge to Israel in War on Hamas

Exactly ten years ago in October 2012, Israel announced the discovery of the ""first offensive tunnel"" in the Gaza Strip. The tunnel stretched 800 meters, from Khan Younis to a hundred meters into Israeli territory, and was 20 meters deep underground and was two meters in width and height.
Israel did not find any weapons or explosives in the tunnel, with experts speculating that Hamas was using it to kidnap Israeli soldiers. A major Israeli military commander declared to Haaretz at the time: ""We will make them regret this and we will push them to despair.""
The army destroyed the tunnel, as it did others it had previously discovered. The military even set up a unit dedicated to the destruction of tunnels. It included scientists whose task was to build electronic devices that can detect the underground passages.
Then commander of the Southern Command Yoav Gallant said: ""It is a war of minds between us and Hamas. We are waging it for one sole purpose: victory."" Gallant is now defense minister, and the tunnels now extend far and wide in Gaza. He still speaks of ""victory"" and even of genocide.
In the past ten years, the Israeli army realized that it could not eliminate the tunnel phenomenon. Rather, the tunnels have since grown and become more developed. At first, they were built to allow Hamas fighters to counter Israeli ground attacks and ambush their troops.
They then used them to kidnap soldiers and succeeded in 2014. Two soldiers were kidnapped, and they are still held by Hamas. Israel then decided to build a massive wall, stretching 65 kilometers, above and below ground to prevent Hamas from building tunnels that can extend into Israeli territory. The wall cost Israel a billion dollars, but Hamas only needed to hire contractor for 200 dollars so he can drive bulldozer into the wall and destroy a portion of it.
The movement then expanded the tunnels deep into Gaza. It constructed a massive network that can only be compared to ones in North Korea. The Israelis have not ruled out the possibility that Pyongyang, not just Tehran, may have aided Hamas in the planning.
Furthermore, Hamas may have even benefited from Israeli expertise. In 1980, it had built a whole underground floor under al-Shifa hospital in Gaza when it was still occupying the enclave.
Underground fortress
Israel preoccupied itself in recent years in monitoring the expansion of the tunnels in Gaza and inside its own territories. To destroy some of the tunnels, it used a material that would expand and harden and use up all empty space, sealing off the tunnels.
Meanwhile, Hamas took its time in enlarging its network of tunnels in Gaza. The tunnels now total around 1,300, reaching around 70 meters underground and extending 500 kilometers. Jacob Nagel, former head of Israel's National Security Council, said the tunnels are probably even longer than that, extending thousands of kilometers.
The Israeli army has claimed that it has ""detailed maps"" of the tunnels and was preparing the right plans to turn them into ""graveyards"" for Hamas leaders, who in turn, have said that the tunnels have been heavily developed in the past two years. The technology there will shock the Israelis and turn them into a huge trap for its soldiers, they have warned.
The tunnels have become a major headline of the Gaza war. Hamas leaders and some 20,000 fighters are using the tunnels, which are like an underground fortress.
'Lower Gaza'
There isn't exactly a life in the tunnels given how difficult it can be to live there. However, they are more than just long passageways that the word tunnel implies. Hamas has in fact built an actual city - ""Lower Gaza"" - under Gaza. Some people have spoken of two Gazas under the ground, meaning that there is actually a third Gaza below the underground city.
The network boasts rest areas, meeting rooms, and sleeping areas. It is fully equipped and features a modern ventilation system. It holds storage for food, medicine and fuel and has its own encrypted telecommunications system that Israel has failed in deciphering, as demonstrated in Hamas' surprise attack on October 7.
Israel has weighed its option in how to destroy the tunnels. Experts said it could seal them off with a foam material that expands and hardens in empty spaces and could enlarge to several meters thick. It could use vacuum bombs to destroy them and kill everyone using them. Hamas has stated it is aware of the options at Israel's disposal and its fighters are ready to defy it.

The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah met top leaders of the Palestinian factions Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and discussed what their alliance must do to ""achieve a real victory for the resistance"", Hezbollah said on Wednesday.
Hezbollah has had daily exchanges of fire with Israeli forces along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier since war broke out between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7.
The meeting involved Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad al-Nakhala, Hezbollah said in a statement.
""An assessment was made of the international positions being taken and what the parties of the Axis of Resistance must do ... to realize a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine,"" Hezbollah said.
Their goal was also to halt Israel's ""treacherous and brutal aggression against our oppressed and steadfast people in Gaza and the West Bank.""
""There was agreement on continuing the coordination.""
Hezbollah announced on Wednesday that two more of its fighters had been killed, increasing the death toll in its ranks to 40 fighters since the start of the conflict.
Nasrallah has yet to publicly speak about the war in Gaza and clashes along the Lebanon-Israel border. However, other Hezbollah top officials have warned Israel against its planned ground invasion into the besieged territory.
Israeli officials have said they would retaliate aggressively in case of a cross-border attack by Hezbollah from Lebanon.

First Evacuees Leave Gaza as Israeli Offensive Intensifies

A first group of injured evacuees from Gaza crossed into Egypt on Wednesday under a Qatari-mediated deal, Egyptian media and a source at the border said, as Israeli forces pressed their battle against Hamas militants in the Palestinian enclave.
The evacuees were driven in ambulances through the Rafah border crossing. Under the deal reached between Egypt, Israel and Hamas, a number of foreigners and critically wounded people will be allowed to leave the besieged territory.
The evacuation followed another day of bloodshed in Gaza in which an Israeli air strike on Tuesday killed about 50 people in a refugee camp, according to Palestinian health officials.
Israel said the attack killed a senior Hamas commander and many other combatants.
Israel sent its forces into Hamas-controlled Gaza following weeks of air and artillery bombardments in retaliation for a deadly attack by the group on southern Israel on Oct 7.
Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas. But the civilian death toll in Gaza and the desperate humanitarian conditions have caused great concern across the world as food, fuel, drinking water and medicine run short and hospitals struggle to treat casualties.
An Egyptian security source had said earlier that up to 500 foreign passport holders will pass the Rafah border crossing on Wednesday. About 200 people were waiting at the Palestinian side of the border on Wednesday morning, the source said.
A second source said not all were expected to make it out on Wednesday. There was no timeline for how long the crossing will remain open for evacuation, they added.
A Western official said a list of people with foreign passports who can leave Gaza had been agreed between Israel and Egypt and relevant embassies have been informed. An Israeli official who requested anonymity confirmed that Israel was coordinating the exits with Egypt.
Egypt has prepared a field hospital in Sheikh Zuwayed in the Sinai, medical sources said. Ambulances could be seen waiting at the Rafah crossing.
The first source said this deal, however, was not linked to other issues, such as the release of about 240 hostages held by Hamas or a ""humanitarian pause"" in the fighting which many countries have called for but which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected.
The Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 killed about 300 soldiers and some 1,100 civilians, Israeli figures say.
At least 8,525 Palestinians, including 3,542 children, were killed in retaliatory Israeli strikes on Gaza since Oct.7, the Gaza health ministry says.
Refugee camp hit
The Israeli military said Tuesday's strikes on Jabalia, Gaza's largest refugee camp, had killed Ibrahim Biari, a Hamas commander it said was pivotal in organising the Oct. 7 assault, as well as dozens of Hamas militants.
Palestinian health officials said at least 50 Palestinians were killed and 150 wounded, while a Hamas statement said there were 400 dead and injured in Jabalia, which houses families of refugees from wars with Israel dating back to 1948.
Hamas' armed wing al-Qassam Brigades said seven civilian hostages were killed in the Jabalia attack, including three foreign passport holders. There was no comment from Israel on the claim.
Eleven Israeli soldiers were also killed in fighting on Tuesday, the Israeli military said, its biggest one-day loss since the initial assault.
Netanyahu mourned mounting military losses but said the war would be long but victorious.
""We are in a tough war. It will be a long war,"" he said in a statement. ""I promise to all citizens of Israel: We will get the job done. We will press ahead until victory.""
After a lull of several hours in rocket fire, the Israeli military sounded sirens in southern communities as well as the port cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod.
Power outage
The din of Israeli war planes, tanks and naval boats pounding Gaza city and the north continued all through the night. Israeli ground forces clashed with fighters from Hamas and other groups in the north, southern and eastern areas of Gaza - part of a series of incursions apparently aimed at incremental gains rather than a full-scale invasion.
Communications and internet services were completely cut off in Gaza again on Wednesday, telecommunications provider Paltel said.
""They don't want the world to see their crimes against civilians,"" said Gaza resident Ahmed Muhey.
Dozens of Palestinians gathered outside the Nasser Hospital morgue waiting to get the bodies of their relatives for burial.
Inside, bodies lay on the ground being prepared to be shrouded in white after they were cleaned of dust and blood.
Health officials said they had received 15 bodies of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes overnight in Khan Younis, including four children.
""Everyday there are dead and every day there are children or women among them or both,"" said one doctor.
Two of Gaza's main hospitals - Al Shifa Medical and the Indonesian Hospital - faced a power outage as their generators rapidly run out of fuel.
Permutations
The current violence - the worst in many years of sporadic warfare - erupted at a time when Palestinian hopes for an independent state and an end to Israel's occupation are as far away as ever. Peace talks are now just a distant memory and Netanyahu's right-wing government has expanded Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Israel sees Hamas, which has vowed to destroy the Jewish state, as an existential threat.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will visit Israel on Friday, said the United States and other countries were looking at ""a variety of possible permutations"" for the future of Gaza if Hamas militants are removed from control.
Iran supports Hamas, as well as several other militant groups in the region, and the conflict in Gaza has triggered fears of a wider escalation.
On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had deployed missile boats in the Red Sea, following long-range drone and missile attacks claimed by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.

Gaza War: Quiet Observations About a Stormy Situation

The war between Israel and Hamas has changed equations to the same extent that it reinforced others. It will probably continue to do so, given that it is a war of many wars, and it will almost certainly go on for a period whose duration cannot be predicted, with all the ""surprises"" that its duration could entail.
Israel's arrogance and sense of supremacy have been broken, and it has become evident that security alone, including barriers and walls, does not grant absolute guarantees. Occupation, settlement, humiliation, disregard, and betting on resentments and aspirations eventually fading into oblivion, are not solutions for the actual problems. All of this is good news. It is not only the adversaries and enemies of Israel who welcome this development, it should also stir positive sentiments in far-sighted Israelis and friends of Israel who understand that public affairs cannot be administered by brute force alone. Sadly, Benjamin Netanyahu's current government, which includes the most vile of settlers, reinforced and endorsed Israel's exclusive reliance on all these wretched remedies and took them to the extreme.
But can these implications bear political fruits?
Worryingly, in our case, identifying who was hurt by these military confrontations is more clear cut than identifying who could benefit. Today, Palestinian patriotism has its strong sentiments but lacks practical tools. Several well-established facts overlooked by the impassioned demonstrate that this is the case: from the split between the West Bank and Gaza to the tattered authority of Hamas itself, to say nothing about the conditions of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and perhaps outside of Lebanon, too. Moreover, the current war in Gaza has consolidated the shift that began after 1973: instead of Arab-Israeli wars, localized conflicts with Israel have been fought, and instead of classical armies, populist (mostly Islamist) groups have done the fighting. This was accompanied by a ""slimming"" of the Palestinian national cause that turned it into a slender body that any powerful actor can distort and exploit as it likes.
In discussing the miserable tools of Palestinian patriotism, we recall the differences between the First Intifada of 1987-8, in which the Palestine Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinian people, and the second Intifada that broke out in 2000, and then the Palestinian Authority splitting in two in 2007.
The First Intifada, which was peaceful, contributed to setting the diplomatic course that was seen in Madrid in 1991 and then in Oslo two years later. Whatever one thinks of these two developments, they were undeniably better than those that followed and compromised the Palestinian political representation. The scale of violence and the number of victims thereby increased, while achievements and the role of politics decreased. From then on, things have continued to move in this direction, relegating this legitimate cause to abstraction and rhetorical sanctification as others seized its use value.
And ""others,"" here, refers exclusively to Iran and its camp, who are using the Palestinians to wage a battle to expand their regional influence. This is accompanied by pain and suffering that few other nations have endured. In this regard, the situation of the Palestinians differs only in its scale from that of the Lebanese, whose state decline and weakened national consensus have heightened Iran's influence in their country and given it the upper hand through Hezbollah.
Thus, the gains, if there are any in the longer term, will be in Iran's. It stands to benefit on three levels: Western countries recognizing that Tehran plays a pivotal role in shaping the region and framing its future, the efforts of Arab countries who believe they are making diplomatic breakthroughs on questions of war and peace being undermined, and the grip of Tehran's allies over their countries being strengthened. Foremost among these allies is the Syrian regime, which might have been waiting a long time for a chance to divert the world's attention from its actions, allowing it to expand both north and south.
Given this backdrop, it seems that the enthusiasm for the blow dealt to Israel, though it is justified and understandable sentimentally, is not backed by a more far-sighted perspective on the current war. It is a quandary summed up by two conflicting emotions that have gripped many of the well-intentioned: on the one hand, joy in having caused harm to Israel, and on the other, not wanting to see Iran benefit.
We have seen a similar situation whose lessons many of us have not learned. In Lebanon and beyond, many rallied around Hezbollah following the July 2006 War, forgetting the assassination of Rafik Hariri and the wave of assassinations that followed just a year earlier, under the pretext that no cries should rise above that of the battle with Israel. As soon as the war ended and the party declared that it had achieved a 'divine victory,' the weight of its tyranny on the lives of the Lebanese increased, as did the intractability of establishing a Lebanese state and building a sense of national consensus. Meanwhile, life went back to normal in Israel. Thus, this so-called ""victory"" was a triumph over some of those who had celebrated it.
This is a real, major, and in a sense tragic predicament: supporting a cause whose claimants cannot benefit from; only Iran, Bashar al-Assad, and the like can.
The time has come to distinguish between demanding justice and demanding self-destruction, and to seek alternative means to brute force and the ""cathartic"" bursts of violence in pursuit of justice and rights. Unfortunately, we are starting to see some of the ramifications of celebrating this poisonous Iranian gift. It would not have been hard for anyone with minimal logical thinking capacities to foresee the outcome of an action like that which happened in Gaza. Contrary to the claims of the enthusiastic, we are now further from Palestine than ever, further from achieving justice and attaining rights, and further from reason. This is being said in pain and sorrow one million times. May the innocent civilian victims rest in peace.

Israel conducted an airstrike on Baalbek, Hezbollah's stronghold in eastern Lebanon early Sunday, wounding at least three people, a local official said.
The airstrike near the city of Baalbek was the latest to hit the area in recent weeks.
The strike occurred a few minutes after midnight and wounded three people according to Baalbek's mayor, Bachir Khodr, who posted the news on X.
It was not immediately clear what was struck. The strike came hours after Hezbollah said it used two drones carrying explosives to attack an Israeli Iron Dome missile defense system in the northern Israeli town of Kfar Blum.
The Israeli military said warplanes attacked a workshop used by Hezbollah for military activities. It added that after the strike some 50 rockets were fired from Lebanon toward Israel, saying some were shot down and others fell in open areas.
But Hezbollah said in statement that in response to the ""bombing of a place in the city of Baalbek"" it targeted an Israeli missile and artillery base in Yoav and the Kaila barracks with more than 60 Katyusha rockets.
A pair of Israeli airstrikes March 12 near Baalbek killed at least two people and wounded 20, marking a continuing escalation between Israel and Hezbollah over the war Israel is fighting with Hamas militants in Gaza.

Bodies of 6 Foreign Aid Workers Slain in Israeli Strikes Are Transported Out of Gaza

The bodies of six foreign aid workers killed in a series of Israeli strikes were transported out of the Gaza Strip and into Egypt on Wednesday ahead of their repatriation, Egypt's state-run Qahera TV reported.
The deadly strikes have renewed criticism of Israel's conduct in the nearly six-monthlong war with Hamas, and highlighted the perilous conditions aid workers face in trying to deliver food to the besieged enclave, where experts say nearly a third of the population is on the brink of starvation.
The three British citizens, a Polish citizen, an Australian and a Canadian American dual citizen worked for World Central Kitchen, an international charity founded by celebrity chef José Andrés. Their Palestinian driver was also killed, and his remains were handed over to his family for burial in Gaza.
The other bodies were driven into Egypt through the Rafah crossing.
The seven were distributing food that had been brought into Gaza through a newly established maritime corridor late Monday when Israeli airstrikes targeted their three vehicles, killing everyone inside.
Israel said it carried out the strikes by mistake and that it has launched an independent investigation into how it happened.
Some of Israel's closest allies, including the United States, condemned the deaths, which led the World Central Kitchen and other charities to suspend food deliveries, citing the dire security situation.
Cyprus, which has played a key role in setting up the maritime corridor, said the ships that had arrived Monday were returning to the Mediterranean island nation with some 240 tons of undelivered aid. But it also said the sea deliveries would continue.
Israel faces growing isolation as international criticism of its Gaza assault has mounted. On the same day as the deadly airstrikes, Israel stirred more fears by apparently striking Iran's consulate in Damascus, killing two Iranian generals. The government also moved to shut down a foreign media outlet — Qatari-owned Al Jazeera television.
The hit on the charity's convoy highlighted what critics have called Israel's indiscriminate bombing and lack of regard for civilian casualties in Gaza.
In an op-ed published by Israel's mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot newspaper on Wednesday, Andrés wrote that ""the Israeli government needs to open land routes to food and medicine today. It needs to stop killing civilians and aid workers today.""
Andrés, whose organization has provided aid in war and disaster zones all over the world, including to Israelis after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war, said the strikes ""were not just some unfortunate mistake in the fog of war.""
""It was a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by the (Israeli military). It was also the direct result of (the Israeli) government's policy to squeeze humanitarian aid to desperate levels,"" Andrés wrote.
Israel has severely restricted access to northern Gaza, where experts say famine is imminent.
The deaths of the World Central Kitchen workers threatened to set back efforts by the US and other countries to open a maritime corridor for aid from Cyprus to help ease the desperate conditions in northern Gaza.
US President Joe Biden issued an unusually blunt criticism of Israel by its closest ally, suggesting that the incident demonstrated that Israel was not doing enough to protect civilians.
""Incidents like yesterday's simply should not happen,"" he said. ""The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties.""
Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, announced the results of a preliminary investigation early Wednesday.
""It was a mistake that followed a misidentification -– at night during a war in very complex conditions. It shouldn't have happened,"" he said. He gave no further details. He said an independent body would conduct a ""thorough investigation"" that would be completed in the coming days.
World Central Kitchen said it had coordinated with the Israeli military over the movement of its cars. Three vehicles moving at large distances apart were hit in succession. They were left incinerated and mangled, indicating multiple targeted strikes.
At least one of the vehicles had the charity's logo printed across its roof to make it identifiable from the air, and the ordnance punched a large hole through the roof. A video showed the bodies at a hospital in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, several of them wearing protective gear with the charity's logo.
Nearly 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, around two-thirds of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.
The war began when Hamas-led gunmen stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive offensives in recent history.
Hamas is still holding an estimated 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others, after most of the rest were freed last year in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent months trying to broker another truce and hostage release.

Did Israel Eliminate Hamas After Six Months of War?

After six months of bloody fighting in the Gaza Strip, it remains unclear if Israel has achieved its goal of wiping out Hamas and its control of the Palestinian enclave.
As the conflict continues and Israel withdraws from some parts of Gaza, the crucial question arises: Will Hamas be ousted? Can Israel step in to fill the void?
Before the pullback, Israel promised a new government, but doubts grew when Hamas quickly regained power in certain areas.
Residents in Gaza who spoke to Asharq Al-Awsat doubt Hamas will go unless it willingly hands over control to the Palestinian Authority, which won't be easy.
The Palestinian group has managed to keep its administrative structure intact during the ongoing conflict.
It continues to oversee security, police, ministries, and institutions, even paying partial salaries to its employees.
Despite Israeli attacks on its economic assets, Hamas has distributed financial advances to its members.
According to sources within the Hamas government, the movement's financial arm has worked to ensure salaries for government employees and operatives, despite Israeli strikes on money storage sites.
Employees, like A.S. from the Hamas police force, receive constant instructions to maintain security. The internal security apparatus has arrested collaborators with Israeli forces.
A.S. and their colleagues have also received limited financial disbursements since the onset of the conflict.
""We receive semi-daily instructions focused on maintaining security, monitoring markets and commodity prices, and ensuring protection for aid entering for distribution to citizens,"" A.S. told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Hamas activists, operating individually, are gradually regaining control in Gaza, challenging Israel's objectives. However, Israel finds it difficult to target Hamas' entire security apparatus.
Although the group has suffered significant losses, including headquarters and personnel, it remains standing. Israel claims to have killed many Hamas members but faces skepticism from Palestinians.
Ridwan Maqbul, a political science graduate from Al-Azhar University in Gaza, believes Hamas' leadership still maintains control and scoffs at the idea of a tribal alternative government.

Three Sons of Hamas Leader Haniyeh Killed in Israeli Airstrike

Three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza on Wednesday, the Palestinian group and Haniyeh's family said.
The three sons - Hazem, Amir and Mohammad - were killed after the car they were driving in was bombed in Gaza's Al-Shati camp, Hamas said. Two of Haniyeh's grandchildren were also killed in the attack and a third was wounded, Hamas media said.
""Our demands are clear and specific and we will not make concessions on them. The enemy will be delusional if it thinks that targeting my sons, at the climax of the negotiations and before the movement sends its response, will push Hamas to change its position,"" Haniyeh told pan-Arab Al Jazeera TV.
""The blood of my sons is not dearer than the blood of our people,"" said Haniyeh, who is based abroad in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar.
Haniyeh has been the tough-talking face of Hamas' international diplomacy as war with Israel has raged back in the Gaza Strip, where his family home was destroyed in an Israeli airstrike back in November.
Hamas said on Tuesday it was studying an Israeli ceasefire proposal but that it was ""intransigent"" and did not meet any of the Palestinian demands.
In the seventh month of a war in which Israel's air and ground offensive has devastated Gaza, Hamas wants an end to Israeli military operations and a withdrawal from the enclave, and permission for displaced Palestinians to return home.
Haniyeh's eldest son confirmed in a Facebook post that his three brothers were killed. ""Thanks to God who honored us by the martyrdom of my brothers, Hazem, Amir and Mohammad and their children,"" wrote Abdel-Salam Haniyeh.
Appointed to the armed group's top job in 2017, Haniyeh has moved between Türkiye and Qatar's capital Doha, avoiding Israeli-imposed travel restrictions in blockaded Gaza and enabling him to act as a negotiator in the latest ceasefire negotiations, or communicate with Hamas' main ally Iran.
Israel regards the entire Hamas leadership as terrorists, accusing Haniyeh and other leaders of continuing to ""pull the strings of the Hamas terror organization"".
But how much Haniyeh knew about the Oct. 7 cross-border attack on Israel by Gaza-based fighters beforehand is not clear. The attack plan, drawn up by the Hamas military council in Gaza, was such a closely guarded secret that some Hamas officials abroad seemed shocked by its timing and scale.

Battles, Bombardment in Gaza as Israel Reschedules Talks with US

Battles and bombardment pounded the Gaza Strip on Thursday, after Washington said Israel agreed to reschedule cancelled talks with tensions worsening between the allies.
United States criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has mounted over Gaza's civilian death toll, dire food shortages, and Israeli plans to push its ground offensive against Hamas militants into the far-southern city of Rafah, which is packed with displaced civilians.
World leaders have warned against a Rafah offensive which they fear would worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian situation for the Palestinian territory's 2.4 million residents.
The United Nations reported late Wednesday that famine ""is ever closer to becoming a reality in northern Gaza,"" and said the territory's health system is collapsing ""due to ongoing hostilities and access constraints.""
Bombardment and fighting have continued despite a binding United Nations Security Council resolution passed on Monday demanding an ""immediate ceasefire"" in Gaza and the release of hostages held by militants.
Netanyahu scrapped an Israeli visit to Washington to discuss the Rafah plan, in protest of the UN ceasefire resolution from which the United States abstained, allowing it to pass.
Netanyahu's government has since backtracked and agreed ""to reschedule the meeting dedicated to Rafah"", according to White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre.
She added that they were working to find a ""convenient date"".
US officials say they plan to present Israel with an alternative for Rafah, focused on striking Hamas targets while limiting the civilian toll.
The health ministry, in a preliminary toll issued early on Thursday, said 66 people were killed overnight.
Fighting continued around three of the Strip's hospitals, raising fears for patients, medical staff and displaced people inside them.
The Al-Amal hospital in Khan Yunis, near Rafah, ""has ceased to function completely"", the Palestine Red Crescent said earlier this week, following the evacuation of civilians from the medical center.
Israel's military accuses Hamas of hiding in medical facilities and using civilians as shields.
Early on Thursday, the army said militants had been firing on troops ""from within and outside the emergency ward at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Troops began raiding Al-Shifa early last week, and on Wednesday night carried out an airstrike on the emergency ward ""while avoiding harm to civilians, patients, and medical teams,"" the army said.
The UN has reported ""intensive exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and armed Palestinians"". It cited the health ministry as saying the army has confined medical staff and patients to one building, not allowing them to leave.
Israel's army said troops had evacuated civilians, patients and staff ""to alternative medical facilities"" it set up.
Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles have also massed around the Nasser Hospital, the health ministry said, adding that shots were fired but no raid had yet been launched.
The Red Crescent warned that thousands were trapped inside.
Gaza has endured almost six months of war and a siege that has cut off most food, water, fuel and other supplies.
Israel denies it is blocking food trucks but aid entering the Gaza Strip by land is far below pre-war levels -- around 150 vehicles a day compared with at least 500 before the war, according to UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
With limited ground access, several nations have begun aid airdrops, and a sea corridor from Cyprus delivered its first cargo of food.
But UN agencies said these are no substitute for land deliveries.
Desperate crowds have rushed towards aid packages drifting down on parachutes, and Hamas on Tuesday said 18 people drowned or died in stampedes trying to recover airdropped aid.
Talks in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal, involving US and Egyptian mediators, have brought no result so far, halfway through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin, before meeting visiting Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, stressed that ""the number of civilian casualties is far too high, and the amount of humanitarian aid is far too low"" in Gaza.
US criticism has mounted but President Joe Biden has made clear he will not use his key point of leverage -- cutting US military assistance to Israel, which amounts to billions of dollars.
Netanyahu, who leads a coalition including religious and ultra-nationalist parties, faces ongoing protests at home over his failure to bring home all of the hostages.
Alongside the bloodiest-ever Gaza war, violence has surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where medics and the army said three people were wounded in a gun attack Thursday that targeted a school bus.
The war has raised fears of wider regional conflict, particularly along the Israeli-Lebanon border.
Lebanon's Hezbollah movement on Wednesday announced the deaths of eight of its members after a day of cross-border fire with Israel that left at least 16 people dead.
Israeli first responders said they pronounced a man dead in an Israeli border town, after Hezbollah rocket fire followed an Israeli strike on what its military called a ""military compound"" in southern Lebanon.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Thursday that at least 32,552 people have been killed in the territory during more than five months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants.
The toll includes at least 62 deaths over the past 24 hours, a ministry statement said, adding that 74,980 people have been wounded in the Gaza Strip since the war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7.

Israel Says It Will Investigate Airstrike That Apparently Killed 5 Men Walking in Gaza

Israel's military says it has opened an investigation into an airstrike that appears to have killed five Palestinians in the southern Gaza Strip.
Aerial footage of the episode circulating on social media shows four men walking along a dirt road before they are hit in the strike. A fifth man is then hit as he tries to run away.
The origin of the footage remains unclear. But in a statement Friday, the army said the airstrike had occurred in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, a focus of army operations against Hamas, in early February.
It said the video was being investigated by its special ""fact finding"" body tasked with investigating potential crimes by its forces.
Khan Younis has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the war, sparked when Hamas militants invaded southern Israel on Oct. 7 and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage.
Rights groups have accused Israel of committing war crimes in Gaza, where nearly 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war.
South Africa has filed a case in the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide – a claim Israel rejects. Israel says Hamas is guilty of war crimes and says its military acts within the rules of international law.

Israeli Forces Kill 9 Palestinians in West Bank in 24 Hours

Israeli forces killed two Palestinians in separate incidents in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, increasing to nine the number of Palestinians killed in the territory over 24 hours, the Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Since the Gaza war began, Israel has stepped up military raids in the West Bank, where violence had already been surging for over a year.
UN records show Israeli forces or settlers have killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West bank since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the Gaza war.
A 19-year-old Palestinian died after being shot by Israeli forces in El Bireh near Ramallah on Thursday morning, the Palestinian health ministry said. WAFA said he was wounded during confrontations with Israeli forces.
South of Bethlehem, Israeli forces shot dead a 63-year-old Palestinian near settlement of El'azar, WAFA reported.
The Israeli military said soldiers had fired shots towards ""a Palestinian who aroused their suspicion at the El'azar Junction"".
""A hit was identified and he was later pronounced dead,"" it said, adding that military police had opened an investigation into the incident.
Citing Hebrew-language media, the Times of Israel reported that the 63 year-old man had his hands in the air when he was shot but there was no immediate confirmation from the military.
Israel captured both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war. Palestinians have long aimed to establish an independent state in the territories occupied in 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli forces also killed four Palestinians in the Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank city of Tulkarm overnight, the Palestinian Red Crescent said, adding that two of them were shot and the other two killed in an Israeli strike.
Residents said Israeli forces bulldozed roads in the area.
Israeli forces also killed three Palestinians in the city of Jenin on Wednesday night, WAFA and the Palestine health ministry said, in what Israel's military said was an operation targeting Palestinian militants.
The militant group Jihad said three of its fighters had been killed, calling it an assassination operation.
Following the incident, local sources said Palestinian militants shot dead a Palestinian man in Jenin accused of spying for Israel.
Militants also clashed in Jenin with security forces from the Palestinian Authority (PA), the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas which exercises limited self-rule over patches of the West Bank, angered at the arrest of one of their members, local sources said.

Israel Presses on in Gaza as World Awaits Response to Iran Attack,"

Israel Presses on in Gaza as World Awaits Response to Iran Attack

Israel struck war-battered Gaza overnight, Hamas and witnesses said Monday, as world leaders urged de-escalation awaiting Israel's reaction to Iran's unprecedented attack that heightened fears of wider conflict.
World powers have urged restraint after Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles at Israel late Saturday, though the Israeli military has said nearly all were intercepted.
Tehran's first direct assault on Israel, in retaliation for a deadly April 1 strike on its Damascus consulate, followed months of violence across the region involving Iranian proxies and allies who say they act in support of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
Tensions in Iran ""weaken the regime and rather serve Israel"", the newspaper Israel Hayom said, adding that this suggested Israeli leaders would not rush to retaliate.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has warned that a ""reckless"" Israeli move would spark a ""much stronger response"", while foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said Monday that Western nations should ""appreciate Iran's restraint"" in recent months.
Tehran has insisted the attack on Israel was an act of ""self-defense"" after the Damascus strike that killed seven Revolutionary Guards including two generals.
Gaza war grinds on
The Israeli military said it would not be distracted from its war against Tehran-backed Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the Palestinian armed group's October 7 attack.
""Even while under attack from Iran, we have not lost sight... of our critical mission in Gaza to rescue our hostages from the hands of Iran's proxy Hamas,"" military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said late Sunday.
As mediators eye a deal to halt the fighting, fears persisted over Israeli plans to send ground troops into Rafah, a far-southern city where the majority of Gaza's 2.4 million people have taken refuge.
""Hamas is still holding our hostages in Gaza,"" Hagari said of the roughly 130 people, including 34 presumed dead, who Israel says remain in the hands of Palestinian fighters since the Hamas attack.
""We also have hostages in Rafah, and we will do everything we can to bring them back home,"" the military spokesman told a briefing.
The army said it was calling up ""two reserve brigades for operational activities"", about a week after withdrawing most ground troops from Gaza.
The Hamas government media office said Israeli aircraft and tanks launched ""dozens"" of strikes overnight on central Gaza, reporting several casualties.
Witnesses told AFP that strikes hit the Nuseirat refugee camp, with clashes also reported in other areas of central and northern Gaza.
Hamas's attack that sparked the fighting resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 33,729 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.
Retaliation fears
The UN Security Council held an emergency meeting Sunday following the Iranian attack, where Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the region was ""on the brink"" of war.
""Neither the region nor the world can afford more war,"" the UN chief said.
""Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate.""
G7 leaders also condemned Iran's attack and called for ""restraint"" on all sides, European Council President Charles Michel wrote on X after a video conference on Sunday.
French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday his government would help do everything to avoid a ""conflagration"" in the Middle East.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that after Israel's ""success"" in intercepting the Iranian launches, ""our advice is to contribute to de-escalation"".
Israel's top ally the United States has also urged caution and calm.
""We don't want to see this escalate,"" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told NBC.
After the attack, US President Joe Biden reaffirmed the Washington´s ""ironclad"" support for Israel.
However, a senior US official said Biden had also told Netanyahu that his administration would not offer military support for any retaliation on Iran.
Word of the impending attack prompted Israel to close schools and announce restrictions on public gatherings, with the army saying early Monday that those measures were being lifted for most of the country.
In Iran, airports in the capital and elsewhere reopened on Monday, state media said.
Fears of a wider regional conflict propelled stock markets lower on Monday.
Truce deal 'on the table'
More than six months of war have led to dire humanitarian conditions in the besieged Gaza Strip.
Rumors of a reopened Israeli checkpoint on the coastal road from the territory's south to Gaza City sent thousands of Palestinians heading north on Sunday, despite Israel denying it was open.
Attempting the journey back to northern Gaza, displaced resident Basma Salman said, ""even if it (my house) was destroyed, I want to go there. I couldn't stay in the south.""
""It's overcrowded. We couldn't even take a fresh breath of air there. It was completely terrible.""
In Khan Younis, southern Gaza's main city, civil defense teams said they had retrieved at least 18 bodies from under the rubble of destroyed buildings.
Responding late Saturday to the latest truce plan presented by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, Hamas said it insists on ""a permanent ceasefire"" and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
Israel's Mossad spy agency called this a ""rejection"" of the proposal, accusing Hamas of ""continuing to exploit the tension with Iran"".
But the United States said mediation efforts continue.
""We're not considering diplomacy dead there,"" said the National Security Council's Kirby.
""There's a new deal on the table... It is a good deal"" that would see some hostages released, fighting halted and more humanitarian relief into Gaza, he said.

Israeli Troops Withdraw from Khan Younis Ahead of Expected Rafah Offensive

Israeli troops withdrew on Monday from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, wrapping up a key phase in its ground offensive against the Hamas group.
Defense officials said that troops were merely regrouping as the army prepares to move into what they say is Hamas' last stronghold, Rafah.
Israel for weeks has vowed a ground offensive in Rafah. But the southernmost city shelters some 1.4 million people — more than half of Gaza's population.
The prospect of an offensive has raised global alarm, including from Israel's top ally, the US, which has demanded to see a credible plan to protect civilians.
The Palestinian death toll from the war has passed 33,200, with nearly 76,000 wounded, Gaza's Health Ministry said. The ministry doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tally, but says women and children make up two-thirds of the dead.
The war began Oct. 7 when Hamas-led gunmen stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage.
An Israeli official confirmed that Israel is purchasing 40,000 tents to prepare for the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Rafah.

Netanyahu Denies Inciting Genocide in Gaza

Israel on Tuesday dismissed claims of genocidal intent in statements made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza.
""This false and preposterous charge reflects a deep historical ignorance,"" the Israeli Prime Minister office said in an official statement.
The Israeli response came after South Africa provided evidence accusing Netanyahu of inciting genocide following his use of the term ""Amalek"" - the eternal enemy of the Jewish people while comparing them to Hamas.
The South African legal team last week used the Israeli PM's incitement to genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza in the first hearing before the International Court of Justice in its lawsuit against Israel.
It said that during the war on Gaza, Netanyahu twice used the term ""Amalek"".
On October 28, as the military ground operation into Gaza began, the PM addressed Israeli soldiers by saying: ""Remember what the Amalekites did to you. We remember, and we are fighting.""
In another message to his soldiers on November 3, Netanyahu repeated the ""Amalek"" narrative in a social media post, ""We have always fought bitter enemies who have risen up against us to destroy us. Equipped with strength of spirit and a just cause, we have stood determined against those who seek our lives.""
He added: ""The current fight against the murderers of Hamas is another chapter in the generations-long story of our national resilience. Remember what Amalek did to you.""
Also, in a nationally televised address on October 28, the PM invoked the prophecy of Isaiah, saying: ""This is a war between the children of light and the children of darkness. We are the people of light, they are the people of darkness. We shall realize the prophecy of Isaiah!""
According to historians, the Amalekites are Arabs belonging to a tribe of nomadic Bedouin who inhabited the Sinai Peninsula and southern Palestine. In Jewish folklore, the Amalekites are considered to be the symbol of evil.
They are mentioned in the First Book of Samuel in the Torah, which called for their destruction. ""Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys,"" it says.
On Tuesday, the Prime Minister's office issued a statement, at the advice of Netanyahu's lawyers, denying South Africa's accusations.
""Among the absurdities leveled against Israel at The Hague was the charge that after the October 7 massacre, Netanyahu incited genocide by quoting the biblical phrase 'remember what Amalek did to you.' This false and preposterous charge reflects a deep historical ignorance,"" it said.
Furthermore, the statement said this quote is used in other appropriate instances and is even displayed outside The Hague.
""That is why the words on a banner in a permanent exhibit at Yad Vashem, Israel's famed Holocaust Museum, urge visitors to 'remember what Amalek did to you.' This same phrase appears in The Hague at the memorial for Dutch Jews murdered during the Holocaust. Obviously, neither reference is an incitement to genocide of the German people,"" Netanyahu's office said.
The statement concluded with a clarification of Netanyahu's true intent in using the quote: ""So, too, the Prime Minister's reference to Amalek was not an incitement to genocide of Palestinians but a description of the utterly evil actions perpetrated by the genocidal terrorist of Hamas on October 7 and the need to confront them.""

Palestinian Death Toll Soars Past 25,000 in Gaza with No End in Sight to Israel-Hamas War

The Palestinian death toll in Gaza from over three months of war between Israel and the territory's Hamas rulers has soared past 25,000, the Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday.
At least 178 bodies were brought to Gaza's hospitals in 24 hours along with nearly 300 wounded people, according to Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra.
Women and children are the main victims in the Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations.
The war began with Hamas' surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostage, including men, women and children.
Israel responded with a three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that flattened entire neighborhoods. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.
Some 85% of Gaza's population have fled their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into UN-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. UN officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid enters because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
Gaza's Health Ministry says a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Oct. 7, and another 62,681 have been wounded. Al-Qidra said many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its death toll but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and minors.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense, residential neighborhoods.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Hamas is dismantled and all the hostages are returned.
Nearly half of the captives were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November in exchange for the release of scores of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israel says some 130 remain in captivity, but only around 100 are believed to still be alive.

Blinken Pushes for Progress on Gaza Ceasefire-for-Hostages Deal in Meetings in Egypt,"

Blinken Pushes for Progress on Gaza Ceasefire-for-Hostages Deal in Meetings in Egypt

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed ahead with a diplomatic tour of the Middle East on Tuesday, meeting Egyptian leaders as part of his efforts to secure a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in exchange for the release of hostages.
Blinken's visit also comes amid growing concerns in Egypt about Israel's stated intentions to expand the combat in Gaza to areas on the Egyptian border that are crammed with displaced Palestinians.
Israel's defense minister has said Israel's offensive will eventually reach the town of Rafah, on the Egyptian border, where more than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people have sought refuge and are now living in increasingly miserable conditions.
UN humanitarian monitors said Tuesday that Israeli evacuation orders now cover two-thirds of Gaza's territory, driving thousands more people every day toward the border areas.
Egypt has warned that an Israeli deployment along the border would threaten the peace treaty the two countries signed over four decades ago. Egypt fears an expansion of combat to the Rafah area could push terrified Palestinian civilians across the border, a scenario Egypt has said it is determined to prevent.
Blinken, who was meeting Tuesday with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo, has said repeatedly that Palestinians must not be forced out of Gaza.
BLINKEN PUSHING FOR PROGRESS
During his latest trip, Blinken is seeking progress on a ceasefire deal and on preventing an escalation of regional fighting.
Blinken faces major challenges. Hamas and Israel are publicly at odds over key elements of a potential truce. Israel has dismissed the United States' calls for a path to a Palestinian state, and Iran's militant allies in the region have shown little sign of being deterred by US strikes.
Egypt — along with Qatar, where Blinken will be later Tuesday — have been trying to mediate an agreement between Israel and Hamas that would lead to the release of more hostages in return for a several-week-long pause in Israeli military operations. The outlines of such a deal were worked out by intelligence chiefs from the US, Egypt, Qatar and Israel late last month and have been presented to Hamas, which has not yet formally responded.
US officials said Blinken is hoping to get an update on Hamas' response to the proposal in both Cairo and Doha. Blinken will then travel to Israel to brief Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his War Cabinet on Wednesday about what he heard from the Arab leaders.
As on his previous four trips to the Mideast since the Gaza war began, Blinken's other main goal is to prevent the conflict from spreading, a task made exponentially more difficult by stepped up attacks by Iran-backed militias in the region and increasingly severe US military responses in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the Red Sea that have intensified since last week.
Blinken met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday evening, shortly after arriving in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
FIGHTING ACROSS GAZA
The Palestinian death toll from nearly four months of war has reached 27,585 according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run territory, with the bodies of 107 people brought to hospitals over the past day. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says most of the dead have been women and children.
The war has leveled vast swaths of the tiny enclave and pushed a quarter of residents to starvation.
Israel has vowed to continue the war until it crushes Hamas' military and governing abilities and wins the return of the 100-plus hostages still held by the militant group.
Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, Oct. 7 attack that ignited the war and abducted around 250. More than 100 captives, mostly women and children, were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
The Israeli military said Tuesday it was battling militants in areas across the Gaza Strip, including the southern city of Khan Younis, where it said troops killed dozens of militants over the past day.
An Israeli airstrike in the city hit an apartment building, killing two parents and four of their five children, according to the children's grandfather.
Mahmoud al-Khatib said his 41-year-old son, Tariq, was sleeping along with his family when an Israeli warplane bombed their apartment in the middle of the night. The Israeli military rarely comments on individual strikes, but blames Hamas for civilians deaths, saying the militants embed in civilian areas.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS PERSISTS
UN humanitarian monitors said Tuesday that Israel's evacuation orders in the Gaza Strip now cover two-thirds of the territory, or 246 square kilometers (95 square miles). The affected area was home to 1.78 million Palestinians, or 77% of Gaza's population, before the war.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said in its daily report that the newly displaced only have about 1.5-2 liters (50-67 ounces) of water per day to drink, cook and wash. It also reported a significant increase in chronic diarrhea among children.
Parents of babies face a particularly difficult challenge because of the high cost or lack of diapers, baby formula and milk.
Zainab Al-Zein, who is sheltering in the central town of Deir al-Balah, said she had to feed her 2.5-month-old daughter solid food, such as biscuits and ground rice, well ahead of the typical 6-month mark because milk and formula were not available.
⁠""This is known, of course, as unhealthy eating, and we know that it causes her intestinal distress, bloating and colic,"" al-Zein said. ""As you can see, 24 hours like this, she cries and cries continuously.""

Strike Kills Hezbollah Fighter, Civilian in Lebanon, Amid Seeming Israeli Shift to Targeted Killings

An Israeli airstrike hit two vehicles near a Lebanese army checkpoint in south Lebanon on Sunday, killing a Hezbollah member in one car and a woman in the other and wounding several other people, Lebanese state media and health officials reported.
The strike appeared to be part of a shift in Israeli strategy toward targeted killings in Lebanon after more than three months of near-daily clashes with Hezbollah militants on the border against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Hezbollah announced that one of its members, identified as Fadel Shaar, had been killed in the strike in the town of Kafra.
Several hours later, Lebanon's National News Agency reported that a civilian woman wounded in the strike, Samar al-Sayyed Mohammed, had died of her injuries.
Local civil defense and hospital officials said several others were wounded.
Video from the scene showed a passenger sedan in flames next to a small truck stopped in the middle of the road.
The Israeli military did not comment on the strike.
Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah forces have engaged in near-daily clashes with Israeli troops along the border.
While the clashes had previously been limited mainly to a narrow strip within a few kilometers (miles) from the border, Israel in recent weeks appears to have moved to a strategy of targeted killings of figures from Hezbollah and allied groups, sometimes hitting in areas relatively far from the border, as was the case in Sunday's strike.
On Saturday, another strike near the Lebanese port city of Tyre killed two people in a car - one of them a Hezbollah commander - and two people in a nearby orchard. The commander, Ali Hudruj, was buried Sunday in south Lebanon.
The other occupant of the car, tech sector businessman Mohammad Baqir Diab, was identified as a civilian and was buried in Beirut on Sunday.
On Jan. 2, a presumed Israeli airstrike killed a top Hamas official, Saleh al-Arouri, in a suburb of Beirut, the first such strike in Lebanon's capital since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brutal one-month war in 2006.
Speaking at Hudruj's funeral Sunday, Hezbollah Member of Parliament Hussein Jeshi said Israel had ""resorted to the method of assassinating some members of the resistance"" to compensate for being unable to reach a military victory against Hamas after more than 100 days of war in Gaza.
The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group said in a statement later Sunday that it had launched an attack against the town of Avivim in northern Israel in retaliation for the strike in Kafra and for other ""attacks that targeted Lebanese villages and civilians.""
Israel did not comment on the strike specifically but announced it had struck Hezbollah targets in several locations in Lebanon on Sunday. It later said that an anti-tank missile had hit a house in Avivim and no injuries were reported.
With dangers of a regional conflict flaring on multiple fronts, officials from the United States and Europe have engaged in a flurry of shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks between Israel and Lebanon, attempting to head off an escalation of the conflict into a full-on war on the Lebanese front.

The Israeli military said it rescued two hostages from captivity in the Gaza Strip early Monday, marking a small but symbolically significant success in its quest to bring home over 100 captives believed to be held by the Hamas militant group.
The hostages were released in a raid that included a series of Israeli strikes in Rafah, the city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip where 1.4 million Palestinians have fled to escape fighting elsewhere in the Israel-Hamas war.
Hospital officials in Rafah said at least 16 Palestinians were killed and 55 wounded in a series of overnight airstrikes, but it was not clear how many of the strikes were linked to the hostage rescue.
Israel has described Rafah as the last remaining Hamas stronghold in Gaza after more than four months of war and signaled that its ground offensive may soon target the densely populated city. On Sunday, the White House said President Joe Biden had warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel should not conduct a military operation against Hamas in Rafah without a ""credible and executable"" plan to protect civilians.
The army identified the rescued hostages as Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70, who it said were kidnapped by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Yizhak in the Oct. 7 cross-border attack that triggered the war. Both were airlifted to Sheba Hospital in central Israel and were reported to be in good medical condition. They are just the second and third hostages to be rescued safely. A female soldier was rescued in November.
Monday's raid included at least 15 airstrikes, flares and Apache helicopter fire, witnesses said. Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the operation was based on ""precise intelligence,"" and that the site, located on the second floor of a building, had been watched for some time. He said Netanyahu joined Israel's military chief and other top officials as the raid unfolded.
Hamas militants killed an estimated 1,200 people and kidnapped 250 others in the Oct. 7 raid. An Israeli air and ground offensive has killed over 28,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, displaced over 80% of the population and led to a massive humanitarian crisis.
Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Hamas captivity, while Hamas is holding the remains of roughly 30 others who were either killed on Oct. 7 or died in captivity. Three hostages were mistakenly killed by the army after escaping their captors in December.
The remaining hostages are believed to be spread out and hidden in tunnels, likely in poor conditions. The rescue is a morale booster for Israelis, but it's a small step toward winning the release of all of them.
Har's son-in-law, Idan Bergerano, told Israel's Channel 13 TV that he and his wife were able to see the released captives at the hospital. He said the two men were thin and pale, but communicating well and aware of their surroundings. Bergernano said Har told him immediately upon seeing him: ""You have a birthday today, mazal tov.""
Israel has made the return of all hostages one of the main goals of the war. Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with Israel's military offensive until a ""total victory"" that also includes destroying Hamas' military and governing capabilities.
CONCERNS ABOUT RAFAH The strikes hit around Rafah's Kuwait Hospital early Monday morning, an Associated Press journalist in Rafah said. Some of those wounded in the strikes had been brought to the hospital.
The Israeli military earlier said it struck ""terror targets in the area of Shaboura"" — which is a district in Rafah.
Palestinian health officials did not immediately offer any casualty information. The army said it had killed at least three militants in the raid. An AP journalist counted seven bodies.
Netanyahu has said sending ground troops into Rafah is essential to meeting Israel's war goals. Biden has urged Israel to exercise extreme caution before moving in. An estimated 1.4 million Palestinians — more than half of Gaza's population — are now crammed into Rafah, increasing its population five-fold. Hundreds of thousands of people are now living in sprawling tent camps and overcrowded UN shelters.
Biden's remarks, made in a phone call with Netanyahu late Sunday, were his most forceful language yet on the possible operation. Biden, who last week called Israel's military response in Gaza ""over the top,"" also sought ""urgent and specific"" steps to strengthen humanitarian aid. Israel's Channel 13 TV said the conversation lasted 45 minutes.
Discussion of the potential for a ceasefire agreement took up much of the call, a senior US administration official said, and after weeks of diplomacy, a ""framework"" is now ""pretty much"" in place for a deal that could see the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a halt to fighting.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss negotiations, acknowledged that ""gaps remain,"" but declined to give details. The official said military pressure on Hamas in the southern city of Khan Younis in recent weeks helped bring the group closer to accepting a deal.
Netanyahu's office declined to comment on the call. Hamas' Al-Aqsa television station earlier quoted an unnamed Hamas official as saying any invasion of Rafah would ""blow up"" the talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar.
Biden and Netanyahu spoke after two Egyptian officials and a Western diplomat said Egypt threatened to suspend its peace treaty with Israel if troops are sent into Rafah. The Camp David peace accords have been a cornerstone of regional stability for over 40 years.
WHERE WOULD CIVILIANS GO? Qatar and other countries have also warned of severe repercussions if Israel goes into Rafah.
""An Israeli offensive on Rafah would lead to an unspeakable humanitarian catastrophe and grave tensions with Egypt,"" European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell wrote on X. Human Rights Watch said forced displacement is a war crime.
Inside Rafah, some displaced people packed up again. Rafat and Fedaa Abu Haloub, who fled Beit Lahia in the north earlier in the war, placed their belongings onto a truck. ""We don't know where we can safely take him,"" Fedaa said of their baby. ""Every month we have to move.""
Om Mohammad Al-Ghemry, displaced from Nuseirat, said she hoped Egypt would not allow Israel to force Palestinians to flee into the Sinai ""because we do not want to leave.""
Heavy fighting continues in central Gaza and Khan Younis.
Gaza's Health Ministry said Sunday that the bodies of 112 people killed across the territory had been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours. The death toll is 28,176 since the start of the war. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but says most of those killed were women and children.

Gaza Combat Surges Anew as Israeli Tanks Storm Back into Areas They Left

Israeli tanks stormed back into parts of the northern Gaza Strip they had left last week, residents said on Tuesday, reigniting some of the most intense fighting since the New Year when Israel announced it was scaling back its operations there.
Massive explosions could be seen over northern areas of Gaza from across the border with Israel - a rarity over the past two weeks after Israel announced a drawdown of forces in the north as part of a transition to smaller, targeted operations.
The rattle of gunfire reverberated across the border through the night. In the morning, contrails snaked through the sky as Israel's Iron Dome defenses shot down rockets fired by militants across the fence, proof they retain the capability to launch them despite more than 100 days of war.
Israel said its forces had killed dozens of Hamas fighters overnight in clashes in Beit Lahiya on Gaza's northern edge. Gaza health authorities said the last 24 hours of Israeli bombing had killed 158 people in the Palestinian enclave, raising their toll for the war, now in its fourth month, to 24,285, with thousands more bodies feared lost in the rubble.
Israel launched the war to eradicate Hamas after militants stormed across the border fence on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing 240 hostages. The war has driven nearly all Gazans from their homes, some several times, and caused a humanitarian crisis, with food, fuel and medical supplies running low.
Under US pressure to reduce civilian casualties, Israel had said it was transitioning from a full-scale ground assault to targeted operations against the Hamas militants that control the enclave.
It began that shift with a pullback in the north. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also said on Monday that the more recent ground assault in the south was drawing to a close.
But any path toward de-escalating the war still seems remote, with Israel saying it will not rest until Hamas is destroyed, and the militants showing no sign of losing the ability to resist.
Israel Ziv, a retired general who formerly commanded Israeli forces in Gaza, told Reuters that 10-15% of Hamas' pre-war rocketry corps of some 1,000 personnel were believed to be still alive, with some 2,000 rockets left to be fired.
However, Ziv said, Israeli forces had by now established ""extensive control"" in Gaza, meaning they could ""maneuver freely"", except in Rafah, Deir al-Balah and Nusseirat, the launch point of Tuesday's rocket salvo.
Change of plans
Some of the hundreds of thousands of residents who fled the north earlier in the war had begun returning last week to bombed-out areas where the Israelis had withdrawn. But residents who spoke to Reuters on Tuesday said the abrupt resurgence of fighting in the north would now halt plans to try to go home.
""We almost planned to return to our house in Nazla, east of Jabalia, but thank God we didn't. This morning people living nearby arrived here and told us the tanks pushed back there,"" said Abu Khaled, 43, a father of three now living with relatives in severely damaged Gaza City.
""The sounds of bombing from the tanks, from the planes didn't stop all night. It reminded us of the first day of the ground incursion.""
Israeli forces have fought their way to the center of Gaza's main southern city of Khan Younis, and into towns north and east of the central city of Deir al-Balah.
Israeli commando forces carried out targeted raids in Khan Younis to take out militant infrastructure, including offices of several senior regional Hamas commanders, the military said.
The Gaza war has inflamed tensions across the region, including in the Red Sea, where the Iran-aligned Houthi militias in Yemen have been attacking commercial ships. The route is used by 15% of world shipping. The militias say they are targeting vessels linked to Israel in solidarity with Gaza.
The United States and Britain responded by bombing Yemen to prevent what they called a threat to global commerce.
The latest ship to be attacked, a Malta-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier, sustained minor damage on Tuesday when it was hit with a missile in the Red Sea. No injuries were reported.
'Forgive me, my son, I could not protect you'
Defense Minister Gallant's announcement on Monday that the major ground offensive in the south would end soon raises the question of whether the Israelis will still try to advance into remaining areas they have yet to enter.
Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are now crowded into those few areas, including Deir al-Balah and Rafah, which is located on the southern edge of the Strip bordering Egypt.
In Khan Younis, Zaher Abu Zarifa wept and cradled a black plastic body bag holding his seven-year-old son Saif, one of at least 11 bodies brought out at a hospital morgue.
The boy was killed by a missile while playing on a bicycle by a school gate, his father said.
Later, by a small freshly dug grave, a gravedigger unzipped the bag so the father could kiss the boy's face, then zipped it back up, took the boy and gently laid him in the ground.
""Forgive me, my son. I could not protect you,"" the father repeated. ""Forgive me, my son. I could not protect you.""

Israel Charges Back into Gaza City as US Plans Response to Killing of Its Troops,"

Israel Charges Back into Gaza City as US Plans Response to Killing of Its Troops

Israel launched an assault on Gaza's main northern city weeks after pulling back from it, while Washington vowed to take ""all necessary action"" to defend its troops after they suffered the first deadly strike in the Middle East since the Gaza war began.
A day after three US servicemen on the Syrian-Jordanian border were killed and at least 34 wounded in what Washington called a drone attack by Iran-backed militants, President Joe Biden's administration was under pressure to respond firmly without triggering a wider war.
""The President and I will not tolerate attacks on US forces and we will take all necessary actions to defend the US and our troops,"" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Monday at the Pentagon.
Iran denied any role, but the first fatalities in what have been scores of attacks on US forces in the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war broke out prompted calls from US politicians for a direct response.
Biden has ordered retaliatory attacks on Iranian-backed groups but has so far stopped short of hitting Iran directly.
""Have no doubt - we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner of our choosing,"" he said on Sunday.
Inside Gaza, residents said air strikes on neighborhoods across Gaza City killed and wounded many people. While tanks shelled the eastern areas of the city, naval boats fired shells and gun rounds at the beachfront areas in the west, they said.
Israel said late last year that it had largely completed operations in northern Gaza. The push back into Gaza City, where residents reported fierce gun battles near the main Al-Shifa hospital, indicated that the war was not going to plan.
Among those killed were two Palestinian journalists, Essam El-lulu and Hussein Attalah, along with several members of their families, health officials and the journalist union said.
Hamas, for its part, fired its first volley of rockets for weeks into Israeli cities, proving that the militant group running Gaza still had the capability to launch them after nearly four months of war.
The Israeli military said it shot down six of 15 rockets. Hamas said it had fired them to avenge deaths in Gaza. There were no reports of any casualties in Israel, where air raid sirens sounded and explosions of interceptions were heard overhead.
GAZANS SAY ISRAEL IS IGNORING THE WORLD COURT
Gazans said renewed violence in the enclave made a mockery of a ruling last week by the World Court calling on Israel to do more to help civilians. Health officials say 26,637 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict with thousands more bodies likely under the rubble of destroyed buildings.
""The war continues in a dirtier manner,"" said Gaza City resident Mustafa Ibrahim, a Palestinian human rights activist now displaced with his family in Rafah near the southern border with Egypt, along with more than a million other Gazans.
Israel ordered new evacuations of the most populated areas of Gaza City, but people said communications blackouts meant many would miss them. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of civilians for operating among them, which the fighters deny.
People in the north have been grinding animal feed to make flour after flour, rice and sugar ran out, part of an aid crisis now exacerbated by a withdrawal of support for the United Nations' aid agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
The United States and another major donor, Germany, are among countries to have suspended aid to the agency since Friday after Israel said 12 of UNRWA's 13,000 staff in Gaza were involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel which killed about 1,200 people.
The Israeli report, seen by Reuters, said 190 UNRWA staff were militants, naming 11 of them.
UNRWA, which says more than 150 of its staff have been killed since October and a million Palestinians are sheltering in its buildings, said it would have to end operations within a month if funding was not restored. It said it had promptly fired staff after being alerted to Israel's allegations.
Air strikes also hit the southern city of Khan Younis, main focus of Israel's attack since last week, which has brought fighting deep into territory holding hundreds of thousands of people who had already fled other areas.
Thousands have now been forced to flee again in a desperate exodus. People fled south on foot carrying children and bedding. Suleiman Abusari, a boy in a wheelchair pushed by his father, said his legs were amputated after an Israeli drone hit him.
""My dream was to play football,"" he said. ""They stole my dream.""
'NOT OVER THE FINISH LINE'
Biden and other leaders have been pushing for a new temporary ceasefire to allow for the release of hostages held by Hamas and get more aid into Gaza.
Talks on Sunday initiated by Qatar and involving US, Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs were ""constructive"", Israel said, while adding that ""significant gaps"" remain.
White House national security spokesman said there was a framework for a hostage deal, but: ""We're not over the finish line right yet.""
Violence has also engulfed the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian health ministry said five people were killed by Israeli forces in four incidents in 24 hours. The Israeli military said three were in response to attempted gun, knife or stone-throwing attacks on its soldiers.
Within Israel, the military said an unidentified motorist in Haifa rammed a soldier and then tried to attack him with an axe before being shot.
In neighboring Syria, two people were killed and several wounded in an Israeli attack on the outskirts of the Syrian capital, Iranian and Syrian media said. Iran's ambassador to Damascus denied reports the location was an Iranian military post.
Israel has a longstanding reputation for attacks on Iran-linked targets in Syria. An Israeli military spokesperson declined to comment.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected two key demands Hamas has made during indirect ceasefire talks, saying Israel will not withdraw from the Gaza Strip or release thousands of jailed militants.
During an event Tuesday in the occupied West Bank, Netanyahu again vowed that the war would not end without Israel's ""absolute victory"" over Hamas.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces working undercover killed three Palestinian militants in a raid on a hospital in the West Bank, where violence has surged since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.
The Israeli military said forces entered the Ibn Sina hospital in the northern city of Jenin early Tuesday and shot the three men, whom Hamas claimed as members. The military said the men were using the hospital as a hideout and that at least one was planning an attack.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the Israeli forces opened fire inside the hospital's wards and called on the international community to stop Israeli operations in hospitals.
Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, most of them women and minors, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths.
The Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that sparked the war killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and about 250 people were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Displaced Palestinians Leave One of Gaza's Main Hospitals after Weeks of Being Isolated by Fighting,"

Displaced Palestinians Leave One of Gaza's Main Hospitals after Weeks of Being Isolated by Fighting

Palestinians have begun evacuating the main hospital in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, according to videos shared by medics on Wednesday. Weeks of heavy fighting had isolated the medical facility and claimed the lives of several people inside it.
The war between Israel and Hamas, now in its fifth month, has devastated Gaza' health sector, with less than half of its hospitals even partially functioning as scores of people are killed and wounded in daily bombardments. Israel accuses the militants of using hospitals and other civilian buildings as cover.
Khan Younis is the main target of a rolling ground offensive that Israel has said will soon be expanded to Gaza' southernmost city of Rafah. Some 1.4 million people — over half the territory's population — are crammed into tent camps and overflowing apartments and shelters in the town on the Egyptian border.
The videos showed dozens of Palestinians carrying their belongings in sacks and making their way out of the Nasser Hospital complex. A doctor wearing green hospital scrubs walked ahead of the crowd, some of whom were carrying white flags.
The Israeli military said it had opened a secure route to allow civilians to leave the hospital, while medics and patients could remain inside. Troops have been ordered to ""prioritize the safety of civilians, patients, medical workers, and medical facilities during the operation,"" it said.
The military had ordered the evacuation of the hospital and surrounding areas last month. But as with other health facilities, medics said patients were unable to safely leave or be relocated, and thousands of people displaced by fighting elsewhere remained there. Palestinians say nowhere is safe in the besieged territory, as Israel continues to carry out strikes in all parts of it.
The Gaza Health Ministry said last week that Israeli snipers on surrounding buildings were preventing people from entering or leaving the hospital. It said 10 people have been killed inside the complex over the past week, including three shot and killed on Tuesday.
The ministry says around 300 medical staff were treating some 450 patients, including people wounded in strikes. It says 10,000 displaced people were sheltering in the facility.
The war erupted after Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 captive. Over 100 hostages were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November in return for 240 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
Israel responded to the attack by launching one of the deadliest and most destructive air and ground offensives in recent history. At least 28,576 Palestinians have been killed, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
That includes over 100 bodies brought to hospitals in the last 24 hours. Over 68,000 people have been wounded in the war, including around 11,000 in need of evacuation for urgent treatment, according to the ministry.
Around 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes, large areas in northern Gaza have been completely destroyed and a humanitarian crisis has left a quarter of the population starving.
The fighting also threatens to trigger a wider conflict. Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group has traded fire with Israeli forces on a daily basis along the border. A rocket attack on Wednesday wounded at least eight people when one of the projectiles hit a home in the northern Israeli town of Safed.
The United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, has been working with Qatar and Egypt to try and broker a ceasefire and the return of the remaining 130 hostages, around a fourth of whom are believed to be dead.
The negotiators held talks in Cairo on Tuesday that were attended by CIA chief William Burns and David Barnea, the head of Israel's Mossad spy agency, but there were no signs of a breakthrough.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until ""total victory"" over Hamas and the return of all the hostages. Hamas has said it will not release all the captives until Israel ends its offensive, withdraws from Gaza and releases a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including top militants. Netanyahu has rejected those demands, calling them ""delusional.""

In Israel, Blinken Pushes for Pause in Gaza War to Allow for Aid

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday voiced hopes for a deal for the release of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas in return for an extended pause to the war in Gaza.
""There's a lot of work to be done but we are very much focused on doing that work, and hopefully being able to resume releasing hostages that was interrupted,"" Blinken told reporters at the start of his meeting in Jerusalem with Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
The top US diplomat earlier met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and discussed a Hamas counter proposal to a ceasefire proposal drawn up by US and Israeli spy chiefs and delivered to the militant group last week by Qatari and Egyptian mediators.
Other Israeli officials such as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Mossad Director David Barnea also attended the meeting, according to a video from the beginning of the meeting released by Netanyahu's office.
The top US diplomat has been conducting intense shuttle diplomacy, crisscrossing the Middle East on Tuesday in his fifth visit to the region since the deadly Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, and meeting with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar, two countries mediating the hostage negotiations with Hamas.
Blinken and other senior US officials see securing a deal to release the remaining hostages in exchange for an extended pause in the Israel-Hamas war as the best path forward for space for talks to obtain a wider integration of Israel into the region.
Talks on the structure of Gaza when the war ends, how the Palestinian Authority - which exercises limited self-rule in some areas of the occupied West Bank - needs to be reformed to potentially rule the densely populated enclave and identifying a pathway for a Palestinian state are all variables in the same equation, according to US officials.
Ensuring more humanitarian aid reaches Gaza and is distributed to those in need also depends on an end to the fighting, officials say.
Blinken told Herzog he would share with him what he heard in his meeting with Saudi, Egyptian and Qatari officials on Israel's wider integration into the region.
""I do believe that there's a very positive, powerful future that is possible that genuinely integrates Israel into the region and addresses its most profound security needs to be able to live in peace and genuine security and also answers the aspirations of the Palestinian people,"" Blinken said.
""You can see that equation very clearly, and it was only reinforced by my visits with our friends and partners in the region.""

Hamas Gives 'Initial' Support to Gaza Truce Plan as Fighting Rages,"

Hamas Gives 'Initial' Support to Gaza Truce Plan as Fighting Rages
Asharq Alawsat (English Edition)
February 2, 2024 Friday

Fighting in Gaza raged on Friday with scores reported killed overnight, after mediator Qatar said Hamas had given its ""initial"" support to a hostage-prisoner exchange deal that would pause its war with Israel.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said 112 people had been killed over the previous 24 hours, while the Hamas press office reported Israeli air and artillery bombardment around Khan Younis -- southern Gaza's main city and the focus of recent fighting.
Gaza City resident Abir al-Madhun said leaflets calling on civilians to leave had again been dropped by Israeli aircraft over the Al-Shifa Hospital compound where she has sought refuge.
""Our houses were destroyed; our children were killed. Where should we go?"" she asked. ""The shooting must stop so we can find a place to live.""
Nearly four months of fighting have left Gaza ""uninhabitable"", the United Nations says, while an Israeli siege has resulted in dire shortages of food, water, fuel and medicines.
Winter storms brought torrential rain to Gaza Friday, piling more misery on the hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians who have sought shelter in bombed out buildings and makeshift camps.
The humanitarian crisis and the mounting civilian death toll have triggered growing international calls for a ceasefire.
After a truce proposal agreed with Israeli negotiators was presented to Hamas on Thursday, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said there were hopes of ""good news"" about a fresh pause to the fighting ""in the next couple of weeks"".
Ansari said a truce plan thrashed out with Israeli negotiators by Egyptian, Qatari and US mediators in Paris earlier this week had received a ""positive"" initial response from Hamas.
""That proposal has been approved by the Israeli side and now we have an initial positive confirmation from the Hamas side,"" he said.
But a source close to Hamas told AFP: ""There is no agreement on the framework of the agreement yet -- the factions have important observations -- and the Qatari statement is rushed and not true.""
A Hamas source said the group had been presented with a three-stage plan which would start with an initial six-week halt to the fighting that would see more aid deliveries into Gaza.
The pause would also see the release of ""women, children and sick men over 60"" among the Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, the source said, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.
A deal 'right now'
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,160 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages, and Israel says 132 remain in Gaza, including at least 27 believed to have been killed.
After the attack, Israel launched a withering offensive that has killed at least 27,131 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
Visiting Khan Younis on Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told troops that the city's Hamas brigade had been ""dismantled"" and the ""same will happen in Rafah"", the border town where hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians have sought refuge.
Gallant reiterated the government's position that only military force can secure the release of Israeli hostages, telling troops their operations ""bring us closer to enabling the return of the hostages, because Hamas only responds to pressure"".
The government's tough line has faced mounting opposition inside Israel, with protesters gathering again in Tel Aviv on Thursday night carrying placards featuring hostages' faces and slogans such as ""No more bloodshed"".
""This government, our leadership, needs to make decisions and they need to be brave,"" said activist Moran Zer Katzenstein.
""We need them to bring the hostages back, right now. The only way is through a deal.""
Settler sanctions
Violence has also flared in the occupied West Bank, where more than 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers since October 7.
The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on four Israeli settlers over the violence, in a rare US move against Israelis. Any assets they hold in the United States will be blocked, with Americans forbidden from financial transactions with them.
""The situation in the West Bank -- in particular high levels of extremist settler violence, forced displacement of people and villages, and property destruction -- has reached intolerable levels,"" President Joe Biden said in an executive order laying the groundwork for US actions.
In Syria, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard was killed in an Israel strike south of Damascus, Iranian media reported. Two pro-Iran fighters were also killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said.
Hamas's war with Israel has sparked a surge in attacks by other Iran-backed groups around the region, primarily targeting Israel's Western allies.
Washington has vowed to retaliate for a Sunday drone attack by Iraq-based militants that killed three US soldiers at a base on the Syrian-Jordanian border.
The deaths marked the first US military losses to hostile fire in the region since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7.
US officials have underlined that they are not seeking a confrontation with Tehran, but Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi issued a stern warning Friday against any possible attack.
""We have said many times that we will not be the initiator of any war, but if a country, a cruel force wants to bully, the Islamic Republic of Iran will respond firmly,"" Raisi said.
One faction in the Iran-backed alliance that Washington holds responsible for the Jordan attack, Kataib Hezbollah, announced on Tuesday that it was suspending its attacks on US troops.
But another, the Al-Nujaba movement, vowed Friday to keep up its campaign. ""Any (US) strike will result in an appropriate response,"" Al-Nujaba leader Akram al-Kaabi said in a statement.

Hamas Welcomes World Court Ruling on Israel over War in Gaza

The Palestinian Hamas movement on Friday welcomed the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling on South Africa's request to impose emergency measures against Israel over its war in the Gaza Strip.
The movement also called on the international community to require Israel to implement the court's decisions and stop what they called the ongoing ""genocide"" against Palestinians.
Israel must prevent genocidal acts in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into the territory, the UN's top court ruled Friday, in a closely watched decision that stopped short of calling for a ceasefire.
The International Court of Justice was not deciding whether Israel was actually committing genocide with its military campaign in Gaza -- that process will likely take several years.
But it ruled that the ""catastrophic humanitarian situation"" in Gaza was ""at serious risk of deteriorating further"" before a final decision, so it issued a series of emergency measures.
Israel must ""take all measures in its power"" to prevent genocidal acts and also stop officials making declarations inciting genocide, the court said.
Concretely, the court urged Israel to take ""immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance"".
The case was brought by South Africa, which has accused Israel of breaching the UN Genocide Convention.

Heavy Fighting in Gaza's Second-Largest City Leaves Hundreds of Patients Stranded in Main Hospital

Israeli forces battled Palestinian militants Wednesday near the main hospital in Gaza's second-largest city, where medics said hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people were trapped by the fighting.
Israel has ordered residents to leave a swath of downtown Khan Younis that includes Nasser Hospital and two smaller medical facilities as the country pushes ahead with its 3-month-old offensive against Hamas. The United Nations humanitarian office said the area was home to 88,000 Palestinians and was hosting another 425,000 displaced by fighting elsewhere.
But the aid group Doctors Without Borders said fleeing was not an option for many. It said its staff was trapped inside Nasser with some 850 patients and thousands of displaced people because the surrounding roads were inaccessible or too dangerous. The hospital is one of only two in southern Gaza that can still treat critically ill patients, the group said. Gaza's Health Ministry also said the facility had been isolated.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the offensive until ""complete victory"" against Hamas, which started the war with its Oct. 7 assault across the border, killing some 1,200 people in Israel and abducting another 250.
FIGHTING IN KHAN YOUNIS, AND BEYOND The Israeli military said its forces were battling militants inside Khan Younis after encircling it a day earlier. Military officials said aircraft were striking targets as part of the operations there and had also targeted suspected militants in central and northern Gaza.
The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said nine people were killed when a UN training center in Khan Younis where 800 people were sheltering was struck by tank rounds, according to the agency's Gaza director, Thomas White.
The agency said the same site was also hit earlier this week, killing six. The Israeli military had no immediate comment. Israel says Hamas militants operate in the area of UN facilities, as well as in other civilian structures.
Thousands of people fled south Tuesday from Khan Younis toward the town of Rafah. The UN says some 1.5 million people - around two-thirds of Gaza's population - are crowded into shelters and tent camps in and around Rafah, which is on the border with Egypt.
Even there, Palestinians have found little safety, with Israel regularly carrying out strikes in and around the town. At least five people were killed when a strike hit a mosque Wednesday in Rafah, according to Associated Press journalists who viewed the bodies at a nearby hospital.
Palestinian witnesses said that in recent days Israeli soldiers and tanks had pushed into parts of Muwasi, a sandy area along the coast that Israel had declared a safe zone. Tens of thousands of people were living there in tents without basic services.
In all, some 1.7 million people have been displaced within Gaza, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency. Most have fled from the north, where Israel's air and ground offensive has reduced entire neighborhoods to shelled-out wastelands, raising the question of whether residents will ever be able to return.
At least 210 Palestinians have been killed in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll from the war to 25,700, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it says most of the dead are women and children.
UN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
ISRAELI DIVISIONS OVER WAR AIMS In addition to defeating Hamas, Netanyahu says Israel is also committed to returning the over 100 hostages that remain in captivity after most of the others were freed during a November cease-fire.
But many Israelis, including at least one member of Netanyahu's War Cabinet, say that's impossible without reaching another agreement with Hamas. And the militant group says it won't release any more hostages until Israel ends its offensive.
Egypt and Qatar are working on a new agreement, but officials say the gap between the two sides is still wide.
Meanwhile, bitter political divisions that were set aside after the Oct. 7 attack have begun to reemerge, with Netanyahu facing widespread protests over the failure to prevent the attack and the plight of the captives. Relatives of the hostages interrupted a parliamentary committee meeting Monday.
A BUFFER ZONE IN GAZA? Hamas is still attacking Israeli forces, even in some of the most devastated areas, and firing rockets into Israel. An attack Monday near the border killed 21 Israeli soldiers as they were preparing explosives for a controlled demolition. It was the military's biggest loss of life in a single attack since Oct. 7.
Israeli media said the troops were working to create an informal buffer zone about a kilometer (half a mile) wide along the border to prevent militants from attacking Israeli communities near Gaza. Two TV channels ran footage showing what appeared to be a controlled demolition of several structures near the border, which the broadcasters said was done in the area of the attack.
Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken last Saturday - before the attack - appeared to show the uniform destruction of buildings and agricultural fields in the area.
Military spokespeople have not used the term ""buffer zone,"" but say troops are uprooting militant infrastructure near the border to provide security for Israeli communities on the other side.
The United States, which has provided essential military and diplomatic support for the offensive, has said it is opposed to any attempt by Israel to shrink Gaza's territory.
But President Joe Biden's administration has also urged Israel to scale back military operations and facilitate the delivery of more aid - with limited success. And Netanyahu has outright rejected calls from the US and much of the international community for postwar plans that include the eventual creation of a Palestinian state.
